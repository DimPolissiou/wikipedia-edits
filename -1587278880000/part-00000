It stars [[Gary Oldman]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]], [[Stefanie Scott]], Chloe Perrin, [[Douglas Urbanski]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[Owen Teague]]\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being found drifting on the wreckage of a sailing boat and rescued by the [[Coast Guard]], Sarah and her two daughters are taken into police custody. Sarah is interrogated by Detective Clarkson, who Sarah claims will not believe what happened onboard the boat. Clarkson asks to hear anyway and Sarah tells her what occurred:\n\nSarah's husband David, a helmsman on a tourist ferry, impulsively buys a salvaged sailing boat that had been discovered abandoned by the Coast Guard. David intends to take Sarah and their two daughters, teenager Lindsay and ten-year old Mary, on a trip to [[Bermuda]], as a way to strengthen the family\u2019s bond after Sarah had an affair. The family restores the ship, and David names it Mary after his daughter. While David christens the boat, Lindsay's boyfriend and David's protege Tommy sees a bright flash of light emanate from the note while taking a photo.\n\nDavid, Sarah, Mary, Lindsay, Tommy, and David's friend and Sarah's one-time lover Mike set sail for Bermuda. Mary gains an imaginary friend, a woman she claims lives on the boat, and begins making sinister crayon drawings of her friend. On the first night out, David hears a noise from above deck and investigates. He finds Tommy, who has non-fatally stabbed himself with a knife. Tommy attacks David with the knife and is promptly subdued. David has Tommy confined to a mental institution on the [[Abaco Islands]], and he and Sarah resolve to keep this a secret from the others, which strains Sarah and David's relationship with Lindsay. David later receives word that Tommy hanged himself, much to his horror. Sarah later discovers Mary had drawn a picture of a hangman earlier. Numerous supernatural activity occurs, such as footprints mysteriously appearing, Sarah experiencing vivid nightmares, and Sarah being locked inside the cabin and seeing the apparition of a woman.\n\nTension grows between the crew. Mary smashes a glass on Lindsay's face, and David and Sarah begin to fight constantly, as Sarah wants to turn back while David wants to continue the trip. Sarah and David separately research the history of the boat, and discover that its previous owners had disappeared in similar trips, and all sailed to the same destination; it is implied the boat is possessed by the spirit of a witch who is attempting to replace her children after being drowned.\n\nDavid and Sarah agree to turn back, and David orders Mike to change course. David heads mysterious noises topside, and discovers Mike, now under the control of the witch, has destroyed the sails, drains the ship of gas, and thrown the satellite phone overboard, and that the boat is caught in a torrential storm. Mike attacks David, but is knocked unconscious and trapped inside one of the cabins. Lindsay sees Tommy's ghost, and is convinced to commit suicide by jumping overboard, though she is saved at the last minute by Sarah. Mike is released from the cabin, and stabs David and knocks Sarah unconscious. Sarah awakens, tied up, and watches as Mike tosses David overboard. Mike does the same to Sarah, but she is able to climb back onboard. She attacks Mike, but he gains the upper hand. David, still alive, appears and shoots Mike with a harpoon gun. Mike falls overboard, and Sarah rescues Lindsay and Mary from the cabin she had been locked in. Sarah sends Lindsay and Mary overboard in life jackets while David steers the boat. Before Sarah can leave, David is killed by the witch, who attacks Sarah. Sarah fires a flare gun at the witch, and causes the boat to explode.\n\nAt the police station, Detective Clarkson concludes Sarah is a murderer and delusional, and has her escorted away by a police officer. Clarkson intends to make sure Sarah never gets custody of her daughters. As she checks footage of the interrogation, Clarkson discovers video distortions, and that Sarah is possessed by a witch. Clarkson heads a noise from the room where Sarah had been taken, and discovers the officer who escorted her dead and Sarah gone, having escaped through the window. The final shot reveals that the area surrounding the police station is going through a torrential storm like the one that happened around the boat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as David\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Sarah\n* [[Owen Teague]] as Tommy\n* [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]] as Mike \u00c1lvarez\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Detective Clarkson\n* [[Stefanie Scott]] as Lindsay\n* Chloe Perrin as Mary\n* [[Douglas Urbanski]] as Jay\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2016, Anthony Jaswinski was announced to write the script for the film, with [[Tucker Tooley]] producing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/06/the-shallows-anthony-jaswinski-mary-haunted-ship-tooley-productions-spec-script-1201778924/|title=Haunted Ship Spec By \u2018Shallows\u2019 Scribe Anthony Jaswinski Anchors At Tooley Productions|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref> In September 2017, it was announced [[Gary Oldman]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Owen Teague]], [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]], [[Stefanie Scott]] and Chloe Perrin had joined the cast of the film, with [[Michael Goi]], directing from a screenplay by Anthony Jaswinski.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/gary-oldman-star-supernatural-thriller-mary-1035239|title=Gary Oldman to Star in Supernatural Thriller 'Mary' (Exclusive)|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=September 5, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/stefanie-scott-manuel-garcia-rulfo-chloe-perrin-supernatural-thriller-movie-mary-1202178374/|title=Stefanie Scott, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo & Chloe Perrin Join Thriller \u2018Mary\u2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anita|last=Busch|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref> In August 2018, [[Jennifer Esposito]] joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/jennifer-esposito-gary-oldman-film/|title=Jennifer Esposito to Appear in Gary Oldman Supernatural Thriller \u2018Mary\u2019|website=[[The Wrap]]|first=Umberto|last=Gonzalez|date=August 24, 2018|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIn July 2019, [[RLJE Films]] acquired distribution rights to the film and set it for release on October 11, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/mary-movie-gary-oldman-emily-mortimer-release-date-rlje-films-1202644201/|title=Gary Oldman-Emily Mortimer Thriller \u2018Mary\u2019 Docks At RLJE Films For Fall Release|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=July 10, 2019|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2019}}\nThe film received largely negative reviews from critics.

It is served by [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] and [[TransPennine Express]] services, plus [[Caledonian Sleeper]] overnight services between London and Scotland.\n\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a station on the site in 1838. It was extended in 1850, with new platforms under the separate management of the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], and by 1863 London&ndash;Scotland trains stopped here to allow passengers to eat in the station dining room. The current station was built in 1880 and extended in 1903 and 1913, when it had fifteen platforms. A free buffet for servicemen was provided during both World Wars. The East Lancashire platforms were demolished in the 1970s as connecting lines closed. Only six platforms remain in regular use today.\n\nAs well as intercity trains to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Glasgow Central Station|Glasgow Central]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], the station is served by local trains to other parts of Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.\n\n==Station layout and amenities==\nThe main entrance to the station is at the bottom of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office is located within the small [[concourse]]. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are [[footbridge]]s on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative entrance to the station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station [[car park]]. There is also a [[Subway (underpass)|subway]] which provides step-free access to all but one platforms in use at the station and another entrance serving the station car park at the south end of platform 7.\n\nThe island forming platforms 3 and 4 is a very wide island platform with a long series of buildings. Inside these buildings are services and amenities including a [[newsagent]] and several food outlets including a licensed [[restaurant]]. There are also toilets and a large waiting room. A small travel centre on platform 3, near the ramp, is operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] staff to give information for passengers on the platform. In addition to these main amenities, there is a small coffee shop outlet on platform 4, as well as an additional shop on platforms 1 and 2.\n\nPassenger information systems were updated during 2007 and now use [[dot matrix]] display screens. Preston retained a manual tannoy system until 30 January 2017, a rarity amongst the larger stations in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A new automated announcement system was introduced. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst [[United Kingdom railway station categories|category B]] interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and was set to receive a share of \u00a350m funding for improvements prior to a public spending review initiated in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| title=\u00a350m revamp for 'worst stations' | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8363621.stm | date=17 November 2009 | accessdate=17 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.lep.co.uk/news/local/tracks-of-our-fears-1-776003 Tracks of our fears] Lancashire Evening Post</ref>\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Preston railway station 2008.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 2008]]\n[[File:Preston Station Platforms.jpg|thumb|The ramp to platforms 3 and 4]]\n[[File:Preston railway station.jpg|thumb|Platform 2 looking south]]\n[[File:Preston railway station - DSC03705.JPG|thumb|Platform 3 looking north]]\n[[File:6201 Princess Elizabeth in Preston.jpg|thumb|[[LMS Princess Royal Class 6201 Princess Elizabeth|6201 Princess Elizabeth]] waiting to depart Preston with an excursion train bound for [[Liverpool]].]]\n[[File:45562 Alberta ready to depart Preston.jpg|thumb|[[LMS Jubilee Class 5699 Galatea|45562 Alberta]] waiting to depart Preston in the early evening with a northbound excursion train bound for [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]].]]\nThere are currently six through and two [[bay platform]]s in use at Preston, with two more available for emergency use.

The most popular excursion train's are the ones which are worked by [[steam locomotive]]s. These trips vary from being either ones that start off at Preston and can be seen at the station for a while or briefly stop to pickup passengers before continuing it's journey. Steam locomotives that have been known to visit Preston in recent years include: [[LMS Princess Royal Class 6201 Princess Elizabeth|6201 Princess Elizabeth]], [[LMS Princess Coronation Class 6233 Duchess of Sutherland|6233 Duchess of Sutherland]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5690 Leander|45690 Leander]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5699 Galatea|45699 Galatea]], [[LMS Royal Scot Class 6115 Scots Guardsman|46115 Scots Guardsman]] & [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]].\n\nThe Cumbrian Mountain Express is a regular train which stops at Preston to pickup passengers while heading to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] over [[Shap|Shap Summit]].

This importance continued into the railway age, both as a major junction and as a stopping point about halfway between London and [[Glasgow]].<ref>Lawrence, p.136</ref>\n\n===Preston's railways===\nThe first rail lines in Preston were those of the [[Lancaster Canal Tramroad]], a horse-drawn line connecting two parts of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston<!--but a part continued to operate outside Preston--> in 1862.<ref name=\"GH97_98\">Greville & Holt 1, pp.97&ndash;98</ref>\n\nThe first steam-hauled passenger railway in Preston was the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR). On 31 October 1838 it opened its line from [[Wigan]] to a station on the site of the present-day Preston Station.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.95</ref> This immediately linked the town to London, [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].\n\nEach subsequent line was built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had been taken over by one or both of just two companies.\n\nThe second passenger railway into Preston was the [[Preston and Longridge Railway]], which opened as another horse-drawn tramway on 1 May 1840, to a terminus in {{stnlnk|Deepdale Street}}.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.198</ref> It converted to steam in 1848, but did not run its trains into the North Union station until 1885.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.200\u2013201</ref>\n\n[[File:Euxton, Farington & Preston RJD 62.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Railways around Preston in 1913]]\n[[File:PRESTON PALS MEMORIAL AT PRESTON STATION OCT 2013 (10123073945).jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial tablet to the [[Preston Pals]] at Preston railway station, who departed here for war in 1914]]\nThe [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] (L&PJR) was the third line, which opened on 25 June 1840,<ref name=\"GH96\">Greville & Holt 1, p.96</ref> initially using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L&PJR soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L&PJR trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance to the north of the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6[[penny|d]] per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring to alight at Maxwell House and walk the {{convert|200|yd|-2}} to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the [[Lancaster Canal]] rather than the L&PJR.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/> On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L&PJR passengers had to alight on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.<ref name=\"GH99\">Greville & Holt 1, p.99</ref>\n\nPreston's fourth railway was the [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway]] to [[Fleetwood]], opening, just a few weeks after the L&PJR, on 16 July 1840, to its own terminus at {{stnlnk|Maudlands}} in Leighton Street.<ref name=\"GH96\"/> After 12 February 1844, regular Preston and Wyre trains used the North Union station, along with the L&PJR, although Maudlands Station continued to be used for excursions for some decades.<ref name=\"GH99\"/>\n\nThe fifth company to run trains into Preston was the [[Bolton and Preston Railway]] (BPR), from 22 June 1843. Its line joined the North Union's at Euxton, {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} south of Preston, but the company used Maxwell House railway station instead of the North Union's. However, the NUR charged 1[[shilling|s]] per passenger to BPR trains over its tracks, and eventually the BPR resorted to ferrying its passengers by road between Euxton and Preston. The BPR was driven into submission and was taken over by the NUR from 1 January 1844.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/>\n\nThe sixth line into Preston was that of the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line immediately south of [[Farington railway station|Farrington Station]] (respelt \"Farington\" from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] (ELR) on 3 August 1846.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, pp.99\u2013100</ref> Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built on the east side of the [[North Union Railway|North Union]] station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station.<ref name=\"GH101\">Greville & Holt 1, p.101</ref><ref name=\"S59\">Suggitt, p.59</ref> The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.<ref name=\"GH197\">Greville & Holt 2, p.197</ref>\n\nThe seventh line in Preston was the North Union's own [[Ribble Branch Line|Victoria Quay Branch]] to Victoria Quay on the [[River Ribble]] (later extended to Preston Docks in 1882 and which now connects to the heritage [[Ribble Steam Railway]]).<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.203</ref> The single-track goods line opened in October 1846 from a south-facing junction immediately south of Preston Station, through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29, emerging north of Fishergate Hill near the riverside.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.100</ref>\n\nThe eighth line to Preston was the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]], owned by the ELR and connected to its [[Blackburn]] line into Preston. It opened on 2 April 1849.<ref name=\"GH197\"/> From 1891, its trains used a new curve at Farington to enter Preston via the North Union line.<ref name=\"S59\"/>\n\nThe ninth and final line into Preston was the [[West Lancashire Railway]] (WLR) from [[Southport Central railway station|Southport]]. The railway arrived in Preston on 16 September 1882, by which time all the town's other lines were owned by the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) or the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (LYR), or jointly by both. The independent WLR built its own [[Preston Fishergate Hill railway station|Fishergate Hill station]]. It also built a connecting line to the former ELR (then LYR) line, via which the majority of Southport-to-Preston trains continued to {{stnlnk|Blackburn}}. The railway was not a success, and on 1 July 1897 it was taken over by the LYR. This resulted in the diversion of all passenger services to use the East Lancashire platforms of Preston Station from 16 July 1900.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nThe network of lines south of Preston allowed great flexibility in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town on any of the lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective [[U-turn]], a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.\n\n===Station development===\n[[File:Preston railway station 1850.png|thumb|Layout of station until 1850]]\nWhen the station was first opened in 1838 by the [[North Union Railway]], the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under the west end of Fishergate (then Preston's major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that sometimes station staff had to push trains out of the station.\nBy 1846, the station was already very busy, handling trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, pp.274&ndash;275</ref> North of the station was a network of goods lines around the end of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.\n\nThe station's first expansion came in 1850 when the new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street.<ref name=\"GH101\"/> From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers to eat in the station's dining room.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, p.277</ref> The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time.<ref>Lawrence, p.142</ref> The condition of the station deteriorated to the extent that on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.<ref name=\"GH276\"/>\n\nEventually the station was rebuilt, at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds, reopening in July 1880, and with seven through platforms and four bay platforms. At this time, both the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] bridge and the line as far as Euxton, were widened from two tracks to four.<ref name=\"GH276\">Greville & Holt 3, p.276</ref><ref>Gairns, p.337</ref> A striking feature of the new station was its long and wide central [[island platform]], {{convert|1225|ft|m}} long and {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide. It was larger than any of the London terminal station platforms, the longest being [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross]] at {{convert|990|ft|m|0}}. Along the centre of the platform were refreshment rooms, offices, and waiting rooms. A booking hall at the north end of the station was accessed from the middle of a new bridge carrying Fishergate over the railway. A broad ramp led down to the main island platform, with footbridges to smaller platforms on either side. Further south, the platforms were also linked by a passenger subway and a separate subway for luggage, accessed via hoists.<ref>Lawrence, p.139</ref> At the south end of the main platform, a footbridge led to the nearby [[Park Hotel, Preston|Park Hotel]], a joint LYR/LNWR property, opened in 1883.<ref>Gairns, p.342</ref><ref>Suggitt, p.63</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from the station,<ref name=Times310177>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Gale. Meteorological Reports |date=31 January 1877 |page_number=6 |issue=28853 |column=D }}</ref> but a more serious accident occurred on 13 July 1896 when a {{stnlnk|Euston}} to [[Glasgow]] train passed through the station at an estimated {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}, despite a {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. It was derailed on a tight curve at the north end of the station, killing one person.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref name=Lawrence140>Lawrence, p.140</ref> As a result of this, the tracks were realigned. Charles Street, to the west of the station, was demolished, as were more houses northwest of the station. Fishergate bridge was extended on its west side. This allowed more tracks and platforms to be built on the west side of the station, with gentler curves. The Ribble bridge was widened again, from four to six tracks. These enlargements were completed by 1903.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref>Lawrence, p.141</ref> The east side of the station was also extended in 1913.<ref>Rush, p.7</ref>\n\n[[File:Preston railway station 1926.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 1926]]\n\nBy 1926, the lines and platforms were used as follows, from west to east:\n\n* Southwest of the station was Christian Road Goods Station (previously known as Charles Street Goods Station before 1903).\n* Next was the single-track goods line that curved west to enter the tunnel to the docks.\n* North of the tunnel was a goods loading platform, added in 1903.\n* Then were two through lines for non-stop traffic, added in 1903.\n* Platforms 1 and 2 formed a large island platform, added in 1903, with station buildings, handling through traffic to and from [[Blackpool]]. Platform 2 was also used as a terminal platform for {{stnlnk|Longridge|England}} trains, and as a reversal platform for trains between {{stnlnk|Lancaster}} and Blackpool.\n* Between platforms 2 and 3 was a centre line used as a run-around loop.\n* Platforms 3 and 4 formed a narrow island platform without buildings. Platform 3 was used for terminal and reversal trains, as Platform 2. Platform 4 was a loop platform for Platform 5.\n* Platforms 5 and 6 formed the main, wide island platform, with a full set of buildings along its centre. The platforms were used mainly for [[West Coast Main Line]] services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two [[bay platform]]s, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.\n* Platforms 7 and 8 formed another narrow island platform, somewhat shorter than the other platforms. Platform 7 was a loop platform for Platform 6. Platform 8 was the northbound East Lancashire through platform.\n* Platform 9 was the main southbound East Lancashire through platform, containing more buildings and linked to the Butler Street station entrance.\n* Platform 10 was added in 1913, as another southbound East Lancashire through platform, which trains accessed via a short tunnel underneath a rebuilt Butler Street entrance.\n* Platform 11 was a bay platform, set back at the south end of Platform 9, and curving sharply to the east.\n* Platforms 12 and 13 were bay platforms, between Platforms 11 and 10, also curving east. All three bay platforms were for terminating services to and from Southport, Blackburn and Liverpool via Ormskirk. Platform 13 was added in 1913.\n* To the east of the station was Butler Street Goods Station, with a large number of sidings and two warehouses.<ref>Gairns, pp.342\u2013343</ref>\n\nLater{{When|date=September 2010}}, platforms 11, 12, 13 and 10 were renumbered into the more logical sequence 10, 11, 12, 13.\n<gallery>\nFile:Preston 2 railway station2064010 1b1bf58e.jpg|Southward view from the station in 1959\nFile:Preston 3 station with LMS Patriot 2094612 ef1db98c.jpg|A special runs northbound past old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 4 railway station 2105033 1057ff88.jpg|Blackpool express entering Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston 5 railway station 2107654 26e78e47.jpg|Glasgow express at old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 6 railway station 2109607 caf8224e.jpg|Two northbound expresses at Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston railway station 2057308 1d25ac1e.jpg|Windermere express at old platform 3 in 1963\nFile:Preston 9 railway station geograph-2202233.jpg|Station north end in 1963\nFile:Preston 8 railway station geograph-2199110.jpg|Old platforms 8, 7 and 6 from the footbridge in 1966\n</gallery>\n\n===Contraction===\n[[File:Preston 7 railway station 2039787 d579c3c3.jpg|thumb|The East Lancashire platforms and goods shed, pictured in 1959 from Vicar's Bridge.]]\n[[File:Preston Railway Station E Lancs platforms (cropped).jpg|thumb|Approximately the same location in 2007. A [[multi-storey car park]] has since been built over part of this area.]]\nA number of lines around Preston have closed, including the Longridge line in 1930<ref>Suggitt, p.52</ref><ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.201</ref> and the West Lancashire line in 1964.<ref>Suggitt, p.115</ref> The old island platforms one and two were closed in 1970 together with the goods lines to the west of the station, but it was then extended northwards to allow platform two to become a dedicated parcels platform. The line towards Liverpool was truncated and singled in summer 1970, with Preston services terminating at {{stnlnk|Ormskirk}}. This was followed by the closure of the East Lancashire line, between Preston and {{stnlnk|Bamber Bridge}}, via its original direct route, in April 1972. The East Lancashire platforms 10 to 13 were demolished, along with the Butler Street Goods Yard.<ref>Suggitt, p.60</ref> Their site is now covered by car parks for the station and the adjacent [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]], which was built in the 1980s, partly over the north end of the former goods yard. The remaining platforms 3 to 9 were renumbered 1 to 7.\n\nSome of the station's heritage can still be seen:\n* At the far north end of platform 4 are the remains of the Ladywell Sidings, most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.\n* At the north end of platform 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. It follows the original alignment of the main platform before the 1903 expansion.\n* There is a tunnel between platforms 3 and 4, under the station approach. Locomotives and trains are occasionally stored there.\n* At the north of platform 7 is the blocked up remains of the tunnel which took the platform 13 (originally number 10) through-line from the north, under the Butler Street entrance.\n* At the southern end of platform 7, the platform edge curves away to the east but the line now turns westward to join the main line.\n* The former platforms 1 and 2 are also still in existence, but closed to passengers, and was used for Royal Mail Parcelforce services until recently. Old platform 1 and the lines to its west have been broken to form two bay platforms. Network Rail has its offices here.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the early 1970s, approval was given to electrify the rest of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Weaver Junction through Preston to Glasgow Central. This was accompanied by new signals on the line and a power signal box was constructed north of the station close by Fylde Junction. Electrification over run also took place at this junction. This was also to facilitate electrification to Blackpool at a later date.\n\n===Special features===\n[[File:Plaque at Preston Railway Station UK.jpg|thumb|Plaque on one of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 commemorating the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=584 Engineering Timelines: Carlisle (Lune) Bridge], accessed 10 January 2008</ref>]]\nA free buffet for servicemen was provided at the station during both World Wars. The [[Preston Station Free Buffet Association]] served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours a day for the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3&nbsp;million men between 1915 and 1919. 12&nbsp;million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945.<ref>Hunt, p.18</ref> It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north\u2013south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised ''[[Preston Passion]]'' of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).\n\nOne of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, and carries a small plaque detailing the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974, after the completion of electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\"/>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 1 October 1831, some wagons ran away on an inclined plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at [[Avenham]]brow.

It is served by [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] and [[TransPennine Express]] services, plus [[Caledonian Sleeper]] overnight services between London and Scotland.\n\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a station on the site in 1838. It was extended in 1850, with new platforms under the separate management of the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], and by 1863 London&ndash;Scotland trains stopped here to allow passengers to eat in the station dining room. The current station was built in 1880 and extended in 1903 and 1913, when it had fifteen platforms. A free buffet for servicemen was provided during both World Wars. The East Lancashire platforms were demolished in the 1970s as connecting lines closed. Only six platforms remain in regular use today.\n\nAs well as intercity trains to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Glasgow Central Station|Glasgow Central]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], the station is served by local trains to other parts of Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.\n\n==Station layout and amenities==\nThe main entrance to the station is at the bottom of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office is located within the small [[concourse]]. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are [[footbridge]]s on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative entrance to the station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station [[car park]]. There is also a [[Subway (underpass)|subway]] which provides step-free access to all but one platforms in use at the station and another entrance serving the station car park at the south end of platform 7.\n\nThe island forming platforms 3 and 4 is a very wide island platform with a long series of buildings. Inside these buildings are services and amenities including a [[newsagent]] and several food outlets including a licensed [[restaurant]]. There are also toilets and a large waiting room. A small travel centre on platform 3, near the ramp, is operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] staff to give information for passengers on the platform. In addition to these main amenities, there is a small coffee shop outlet on platform 4, as well as an additional shop on platforms 1 and 2.\n\nPassenger information systems were updated during 2007 and now use [[dot matrix]] display screens.

Steam locomotives that have been known to visit Preston in recent years include: [[LMS Princess Royal Class 6201 Princess Elizabeth|6201 Princess Elizabeth]], [[LMS Princess Coronation Class 6233 Duchess of Sutherland|6233 Duchess of Sutherland]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5690 Leander|45690 Leander]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5699 Galatea|45699 Galatea]], [[LMS Royal Scot Class 6115 Scots Guardsman|46115 Scots Guardsman]] & [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]].\n\nThe Cumbrian Mountain Express is a regular train which stops at Preston to pickup passengers while heading to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] over [[Shap|Shap Summit]]. These are known to run in both the summer and winter each year.\n\n====Future services====\n=====Grand Central=====\nIn June 2018, the [[Office of Rail & Road]] approved an application by [[Alliance Rail Holdings]] for five services per day from London Euston to Blackpool North that will call at Preston.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180910181020/http://www.alliancerail.co.uk/22-new-blackpool-to-london-rail-services-approved New Blackpool to London Services Approved] Alliance Rail Holdings 7 June 2018</ref> These will be operated by sister [[Arriva]] company [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] commencing in 2021.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200408001253/https://www.grandcentralrail.com/news/2019/grand-central-plans-new-blackpool-london-route-2020-in-major-boost-for-local-economy Grand Central plans new Blackpool to London route from 2020 in major boost for the local economy] Grand Central 24 June 2019</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200408001552/https://www.grandcentralrail.com/news/2020/grand-central-announces-temporary-suspension-of-train-services-during-covid-19 Grand Central announces temporary suspension of train services during COVID-19 restrictions] Grand Central 3 April 2020</ref>\n\n=====Merseyrail=====\nLiverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review in 2020 to introduce new [[Merseyrail]] battery trains will be undertaken, in view to put Preston onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail [[Northern line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] from Ormskirk to Preston.

This importance continued into the railway age, both as a major junction and as a stopping point about halfway between London and [[Glasgow]].<ref>Lawrence, p.136</ref>\n\n===Preston's railways===\nThe first rail lines in Preston were those of the [[Lancaster Canal Tramroad]], a horse-drawn line connecting two parts of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston<!--but a part continued to operate outside Preston--> in 1862.<ref name=\"GH97_98\">Greville & Holt 1, pp.97&ndash;98</ref>\n\nThe first steam-hauled passenger railway in Preston was the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR). On 31 October 1838 it opened its line from [[Wigan]] to a station on the site of the present-day Preston Station.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.95</ref> This immediately linked the town to London, [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].\n\nEach subsequent line was built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had been taken over by one or both of just two companies.\n\nThe second passenger railway into Preston was the [[Preston and Longridge Railway]], which opened as another horse-drawn tramway on 1 May 1840, to a terminus in {{stnlnk|Deepdale Street}}.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.198</ref> It converted to steam in 1848, but did not run its trains into the North Union station until 1885.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.200\u2013201</ref>\n\n[[File:Euxton, Farington & Preston RJD 62.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Railways around Preston in 1913]]\n[[File:PRESTON PALS MEMORIAL AT PRESTON STATION OCT 2013 (10123073945).jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial tablet to the [[Preston Pals]] at Preston railway station, who departed here for war in 1914]]\nThe [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] (L&PJR) was the third line, which opened on 25 June 1840,<ref name=\"GH96\">Greville & Holt 1, p.96</ref> initially using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L&PJR soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L&PJR trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance to the north of the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6[[penny|d]] per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring to alight at Maxwell House and walk the {{convert|200|yd|-2}} to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the [[Lancaster Canal]] rather than the L&PJR.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/> On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L&PJR passengers had to alight on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.<ref name=\"GH99\">Greville & Holt 1, p.99</ref>\n\nPreston's fourth railway was the [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway]] to [[Fleetwood]], opening, just a few weeks after the L&PJR, on 16 July 1840, to its own terminus at {{stnlnk|Maudlands}} in Leighton Street.<ref name=\"GH96\"/> After 12 February 1844, regular Preston and Wyre trains used the North Union station, along with the L&PJR, although Maudlands Station continued to be used for excursions for some decades.<ref name=\"GH99\"/>\n\nThe fifth company to run trains into Preston was the [[Bolton and Preston Railway]] (BPR), from 22 June 1843. Its line joined the North Union's at Euxton, {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} south of Preston, but the company used Maxwell House railway station instead of the North Union's. However, the NUR charged 1[[shilling|s]] per passenger to BPR trains over its tracks, and eventually the BPR resorted to ferrying its passengers by road between Euxton and Preston. The BPR was driven into submission and was taken over by the NUR from 1 January 1844.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/>\n\nThe sixth line into Preston was that of the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line immediately south of [[Farington railway station|Farrington Station]] (respelt \"Farington\" from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] (ELR) on 3 August 1846.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, pp.99\u2013100</ref> Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built on the east side of the [[North Union Railway|North Union]] station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station.<ref name=\"GH101\">Greville & Holt 1, p.101</ref><ref name=\"S59\">Suggitt, p.59</ref> The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.<ref name=\"GH197\">Greville & Holt 2, p.197</ref>\n\nThe seventh line in Preston was the North Union's own [[Ribble Branch Line|Victoria Quay Branch]] to Victoria Quay on the [[River Ribble]] (later extended to Preston Docks in 1882 and which now connects to the heritage [[Ribble Steam Railway]]).<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.203</ref> The single-track goods line opened in October 1846 from a south-facing junction immediately south of Preston Station, through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29, emerging north of Fishergate Hill near the riverside.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.100</ref>\n\nThe eighth line to Preston was the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]], owned by the ELR and connected to its [[Blackburn]] line into Preston. It opened on 2 April 1849.<ref name=\"GH197\"/> From 1891, its trains used a new curve at Farington to enter Preston via the North Union line.<ref name=\"S59\"/>\n\nThe ninth and final line into Preston was the [[West Lancashire Railway]] (WLR) from [[Southport Central railway station|Southport]]. The railway arrived in Preston on 16 September 1882, by which time all the town's other lines were owned by the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) or the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (LYR), or jointly by both. The independent WLR built its own [[Preston Fishergate Hill railway station|Fishergate Hill station]]. It also built a connecting line to the former ELR (then LYR) line, via which the majority of Southport-to-Preston trains continued to {{stnlnk|Blackburn}}. The railway was not a success, and on 1 July 1897 it was taken over by the LYR. This resulted in the diversion of all passenger services to use the East Lancashire platforms of Preston Station from 16 July 1900.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nThe network of lines south of Preston allowed great flexibility in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town on any of the lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective [[U-turn]], a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.\n\n===Station development===\n[[File:Preston railway station 1850.png|thumb|Layout of station until 1850]]\nWhen the station was first opened in 1838 by the [[North Union Railway]], the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under the west end of Fishergate (then Preston's major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that sometimes station staff had to push trains out of the station.\nBy 1846, the station was already very busy, handling trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, pp.274&ndash;275</ref> North of the station was a network of goods lines around the end of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.\n\nThe station's first expansion came in 1850 when the new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street.<ref name=\"GH101\"/> From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers to eat in the station's dining room.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, p.277</ref> The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time.<ref>Lawrence, p.142</ref> The condition of the station deteriorated to the extent that on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.<ref name=\"GH276\"/>\n\nEventually the station was rebuilt, at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds, reopening in July 1880, and with seven through platforms and four bay platforms. At this time, both the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] bridge and the line as far as Euxton, were widened from two tracks to four.<ref name=\"GH276\">Greville & Holt 3, p.276</ref><ref>Gairns, p.337</ref> A striking feature of the new station was its long and wide central [[island platform]], {{convert|1225|ft|m}} long and {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide. It was larger than any of the London terminal station platforms, the longest being [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross]] at {{convert|990|ft|m|0}}. Along the centre of the platform were refreshment rooms, offices, and waiting rooms. A booking hall at the north end of the station was accessed from the middle of a new bridge carrying Fishergate over the railway. A broad ramp led down to the main island platform, with footbridges to smaller platforms on either side. Further south, the platforms were also linked by a passenger subway and a separate subway for luggage, accessed via hoists.<ref>Lawrence, p.139</ref> At the south end of the main platform, a footbridge led to the nearby [[Park Hotel, Preston|Park Hotel]], a joint LYR/LNWR property, opened in 1883.<ref>Gairns, p.342</ref><ref>Suggitt, p.63</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from the station,<ref name=Times310177>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Gale. Meteorological Reports |date=31 January 1877 |page_number=6 |issue=28853 |column=D }}</ref> but a more serious accident occurred on 13 July 1896 when a {{stnlnk|Euston}} to [[Glasgow]] train passed through the station at an estimated {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}, despite a {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. It was derailed on a tight curve at the north end of the station, killing one person.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref name=Lawrence140>Lawrence, p.140</ref> As a result of this, the tracks were realigned. Charles Street, to the west of the station, was demolished, as were more houses northwest of the station. Fishergate bridge was extended on its west side. This allowed more tracks and platforms to be built on the west side of the station, with gentler curves. The Ribble bridge was widened again, from four to six tracks. These enlargements were completed by 1903.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref>Lawrence, p.141</ref> The east side of the station was also extended in 1913.<ref>Rush, p.7</ref>\n\n[[File:Preston railway station 1926.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 1926]]\n\nBy 1926, the lines and platforms were used as follows, from west to east:\n\n* Southwest of the station was Christian Road Goods Station (previously known as Charles Street Goods Station before 1903).\n* Next was the single-track goods line that curved west to enter the tunnel to the docks.\n* North of the tunnel was a goods loading platform, added in 1903.\n* Then were two through lines for non-stop traffic, added in 1903.\n* Platforms 1 and 2 formed a large island platform, added in 1903, with station buildings, handling through traffic to and from [[Blackpool]]. Platform 2 was also used as a terminal platform for {{stnlnk|Longridge|England}} trains, and as a reversal platform for trains between {{stnlnk|Lancaster}} and Blackpool.\n* Between platforms 2 and 3 was a centre line used as a run-around loop.\n* Platforms 3 and 4 formed a narrow island platform without buildings. Platform 3 was used for terminal and reversal trains, as Platform 2. Platform 4 was a loop platform for Platform 5.\n* Platforms 5 and 6 formed the main, wide island platform, with a full set of buildings along its centre. The platforms were used mainly for [[West Coast Main Line]] services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two [[bay platform]]s, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.\n* Platforms 7 and 8 formed another narrow island platform, somewhat shorter than the other platforms. Platform 7 was a loop platform for Platform 6. Platform 8 was the northbound East Lancashire through platform.\n* Platform 9 was the main southbound East Lancashire through platform, containing more buildings and linked to the Butler Street station entrance.\n* Platform 10 was added in 1913, as another southbound East Lancashire through platform, which trains accessed via a short tunnel underneath a rebuilt Butler Street entrance.\n* Platform 11 was a bay platform, set back at the south end of Platform 9, and curving sharply to the east.\n* Platforms 12 and 13 were bay platforms, between Platforms 11 and 10, also curving east. All three bay platforms were for terminating services to and from Southport, Blackburn and Liverpool via Ormskirk. Platform 13 was added in 1913.\n* To the east of the station was Butler Street Goods Station, with a large number of sidings and two warehouses.<ref>Gairns, pp.342\u2013343</ref>\n\nLater{{When|date=September 2010}}, platforms 11, 12, 13 and 10 were renumbered into the more logical sequence 10, 11, 12, 13.\n<gallery>\nFile:Preston 2 railway station2064010 1b1bf58e.jpg|Southward view from the station in 1959\nFile:Preston 3 station with LMS Patriot 2094612 ef1db98c.jpg|A special runs northbound past old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 4 railway station 2105033 1057ff88.jpg|Blackpool express entering Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston 5 railway station 2107654 26e78e47.jpg|Glasgow express at old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 6 railway station 2109607 caf8224e.jpg|Two northbound expresses at Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston railway station 2057308 1d25ac1e.jpg|Windermere express at old platform 3 in 1963\nFile:Preston 9 railway station geograph-2202233.jpg|Station north end in 1963\nFile:Preston 8 railway station geograph-2199110.jpg|Old platforms 8, 7 and 6 from the footbridge in 1966\n</gallery>\n\n===Contraction===\n[[File:Preston 7 railway station 2039787 d579c3c3.jpg|thumb|The East Lancashire platforms and goods shed, pictured in 1959 from Vicar's Bridge.]]\n[[File:Preston Railway Station E Lancs platforms (cropped).jpg|thumb|Approximately the same location in 2007. A [[multi-storey car park]] has since been built over part of this area.]]\nA number of lines around Preston have closed, including the Longridge line in 1930<ref>Suggitt, p.52</ref><ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.201</ref> and the West Lancashire line in 1964.<ref>Suggitt, p.115</ref> The old island platforms one and two were closed in 1970 together with the goods lines to the west of the station, but it was then extended northwards to allow platform two to become a dedicated parcels platform. The line towards Liverpool was truncated and singled in summer 1970, with Preston services terminating at {{stnlnk|Ormskirk}}. This was followed by the closure of the East Lancashire line, between Preston and {{stnlnk|Bamber Bridge}}, via its original direct route, in April 1972. The East Lancashire platforms 10 to 13 were demolished, along with the Butler Street Goods Yard.<ref>Suggitt, p.60</ref> Their site is now covered by car parks for the station and the adjacent [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]], which was built in the 1980s, partly over the north end of the former goods yard. The remaining platforms 3 to 9 were renumbered 1 to 7.\n\nSome of the station's heritage can still be seen:\n* At the far north end of platform 4 are the remains of the Ladywell Sidings, most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.\n* At the north end of platform 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. It follows the original alignment of the main platform before the 1903 expansion.\n* There is a tunnel between platforms 3 and 4, under the station approach. Locomotives and trains are occasionally stored there.\n* At the north of platform 7 is the blocked up remains of the tunnel which took the platform 13 (originally number 10) through-line from the north, under the Butler Street entrance.\n* At the southern end of platform 7, the platform edge curves away to the east but the line now turns westward to join the main line.\n* The former platforms 1 and 2 are also still in existence, but closed to passengers, and was used for Royal Mail Parcelforce services until recently. Old platform 1 and the lines to its west have been broken to form two bay platforms. Network Rail has its offices here.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the early 1970s, approval was given to electrify the rest of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Weaver Junction through Preston to Glasgow Central. This was accompanied by new signals on the line and a power signal box was constructed north of the station close by Fylde Junction. Electrification over run also took place at this junction. This was also to facilitate electrification to Blackpool at a later date.\n\n===Special features===\n[[File:Plaque at Preston Railway Station UK.jpg|thumb|Plaque on one of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 commemorating the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=584 Engineering Timelines: Carlisle (Lune) Bridge], accessed 10 January 2008</ref>]]\nA free buffet for servicemen was provided at the station during both World Wars. The [[Preston Station Free Buffet Association]] served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours a day for the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3&nbsp;million men between 1915 and 1919. 12&nbsp;million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945.<ref>Hunt, p.18</ref> It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north\u2013south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised ''[[Preston Passion]]'' of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).\n\nOne of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, and carries a small plaque detailing the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974, after the completion of electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\"/>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 1 October 1831, some wagons ran away on an inclined plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at [[Avenham]]brow.

In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n|doi-access= free\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \"Dying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\" ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111.</ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family.

In a survey of doctors in the mid to late 1980s, a substantial number of physicians indicated that they didn't have an ethical obligation to treat and care for those patients with HIV/AIDS.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Link|first=Nathan|date=April 1988|title=Concerns of Medical and Pediatric House Officers about Acquiring AIDS from their Patients|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=|pages=445\u2013459|via=}}</ref> A study of primary care providers showed that half would not care for patients if they were given a choice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerbert|first=Barbara|date=1991|title=Primary Care Physicians and AIDS|url=|journal=Journal of American Medical Association|volume=|pages=2837\u20132842|via=}}</ref> In 1990, a national survey of doctors showed that \"only 24% believed that office-based practitioners should be legally required to provide care to individuals with HIV infection.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> However, there were many doctors who chose to care for these patients with AIDS for different reasons: they shared the same sexual orientation as the infected, a commitment to providing care to the diseased, an interest in the mysteries of infectious disease, or a desire to tame the awful threat.<ref name=\":02\" /> Treating patients infected with the AIDS virus changed some doctors' personal lives, as it caused them to have to deal with some of the same stigmas that their patients had. This disease also weighed on their minds, because they often had to deal with witnessing the death of patients and most often those patients were as young or even younger than they were.\n\n== By race/ethnicity ==\n'''African Americans''' continue to experience the most severe burden of HIV, compared with other races and ethnicities.

While the overall rates of HIV incidences and prevalence have decreased, they have increased in one particular demographic: African American gay and bisexual men (a 4% increase). In America, black households were reported to have the lowest median income, leading to lower rates of individuals with health insurance. This creates cost barriers to antiretroviral treatments. The racial disparities between women afflicted with HIV/AIDS have been made clear in a 2010 study as well, which showed that 64% of women infected with HIV that year were Black women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Riley J.|last2=Finocchario-Kessler|first2=Sarah|last3=Dariotis|first3=Jacinda K.|date=2013|title=Engaging HIV Care Providers in Conversations With Their Reproductive-Age Patients About Fertility Desires and Intentions: A Historical Review of the HIV Epidemic in the United States|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1357\u20131366|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301265|pmid=23763424|pmc=4007857|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> This unequal distribution has led researchers to studying the long-term effects of racial and gender discrimination along with HIV-related stigma, and how this plays a role in people's lives.\n\n'''Hispanics/Latinos''' are also disproportionately affected by HIV.

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis. They kept treatment from these men to see what would happen. [[Henrietta Lacks]] was also exploited when researchers took her cancerous cells and grew them to experiment on them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Man in a White Coat|last=Tweedy|first=Damon|publisher=Picador|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nHomosexuality is viewed negatively in the African American Community. \"In a qualitative study of 745 racially and ethnic diverse undergraduates attending a large Midwestern university, Calzo and Ward (2009) determined that parents of African-American participants discussed homosexuality more frequently than the parents of other respondents.

Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is \"effeminate\", then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. \"Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \"Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nSex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been [[infectious diseases within American prisons|spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons]]. \"Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.\" Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates. There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because \"nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,\" the problem persists outside of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-in-correctional-settings|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Activism and response ==\nStarting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and \"alternative media\" created by those living with or close to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8223-1695-4|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this \"alternative media\" created by activist groups, mass media reports on AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals afflicted with AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HEREK|first=GREGORY M.|date=1999|title=AIDS and Stigma|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en-US|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1106\u20131116|doi=10.1177/0002764299042007004|issn=0002-7642|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2627cf2069a85bbd3ec607ae91cb6fd4d6c6b859}}</ref>\n\nActivist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex.

Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|magazine=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like pride parades, [[World AIDS Day]], or [[AIDS Walk|AIDS walks]]. Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV. While PrEP appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks, specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex.<ref>Holt M, Lea T, Mao L, Kolstee J, Zablotska I, Duck T, Allan B, West M, Lee E, Hull P, Grulich A, De Wit J, Prestage G (August 2018). \"Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013-17\".

In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n|doi-access= free\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \"Dying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\" ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111.</ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family.

This disease also weighed on their minds, because they often had to deal with witnessing the death of patients and most often those patients were as young or even younger than they were.\n\n== By race/ethnicity ==\n'''African Americans''' continue to experience the most severe burden of HIV, compared with other races and ethnicities.

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis.

Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is \"effeminate\", then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. \"Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \"Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nSex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been [[infectious diseases within American prisons|spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons]]. \"Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.\" Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates. There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because \"nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,\" the problem persists outside of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-in-correctional-settings|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Activism and response ==\nStarting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and \"alternative media\" created by those living with or close to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8223-1695-4|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this \"alternative media\" created by activist groups, mass media reports on AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals afflicted with AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HEREK|first=GREGORY M.|date=1999|title=AIDS and Stigma|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en-US|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1106\u20131116|doi=10.1177/0002764299042007004|issn=0002-7642|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2627cf2069a85bbd3ec607ae91cb6fd4d6c6b859}}</ref>\n\nActivist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex.

Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|magazine=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy.

Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV. While PrEP appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks, specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex.<ref>Holt M, Lea T, Mao L, Kolstee J, Zablotska I, Duck T, Allan B, West M, Lee E, Hull P, Grulich A, De Wit J, Prestage G (August 2018). \"Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013-17\".

Because of the lack of HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor [[Mike Pence]], despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which could end up being instituted statewide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/24/402034996/hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-grows-with-nearly-140-confirmed-cases|title=HIV Outbreak In Indiana Grows With Nearly 140 Confirmed Cases|last1=Block |first1=Melissa |last2=Adams|first2=Jerome |date=April 24, 2015|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criminal transmission of HIV in the United States]]\n* [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]]\n* [[AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs)]]\n* [[People With AIDS]] Self-Empowerment Movement\n* [[HIV/AIDS in New York City]]\n* [[Hank M.

Located in the southern [[Mozambique Channel]], about halfway between [[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]] (about {{convert|385|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} further east) and around {{convert|110|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Europa Island]], the rim of the atoll averages around {{convert|100|m}} in width and encloses a shallow lagoon of depth no greater than {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}. Overall, the atoll is about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, rising steeply from the [[seabed]] {{convert|3000|m}} below to encircle an area (including lagoon) of {{convert|80|km2|abbr=on}}. Its [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ), {{convert|123700|km\u00b2|abbr=on}} in size, is [[Contiguous zone|contiguous]] with that of Europa Island.\n\nThe atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling {{convert|20|ha}} in area. Those on the north and east sides are {{convert|7|to|10|ft|order=flip}} high, while those on the west and south sides are {{convert|4|ft|order=flip}} high. The reef, whose coastline measures {{convert|35.2|km|abbr=on}}, is completely covered by the sea from three hours before [[Tide|high tide]] to three hours afterward. The region is also subject to [[cyclone]]s, making the atoll a long-time maritime hazard and the site of numerous shipwrecks.\n\n[[Jaguar Seamount]] and [[Hall Tablemount]] lie, respectively, about {{convert|40|and|70|km}} further southwest.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Bassas da India was first recorded by [[Portuguese explorers]] in the early sixteenth century as the \"'''''Baixo da'' Judia'''\" (\"''Jewess'' Shoals\").
