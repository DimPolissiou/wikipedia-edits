However, some individual athletes competed under the Olympic flag as [[Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Participants]].\n* In [[basketball]], the admittance of NBA players led to the formation of the \"[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]\" of the United States, featuring [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Larry Bird]] and other [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] stars.

Scherbo tied [[Eric Heiden]]'s record for individual gold medals at a single Olympics, winning five medals in an individual event ([[Michael Phelps]] would later equal this record in [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]).\n* In women's artistic gymnastics, [[Tatiana Gutsu]] took gold in the All-Around competition edging the United States' [[Shannon Miller]].\n* Russian swimmers (competing for the Unified Team) dominated the men's freestyle events, with [[Alexander Popov (swimmer)|Alexander Popov]] and [[Yevgeny Sadovyi]] each winning two events.

In the preliminary round, they lost a controversial match to Japan, sparking them to shave their heads in protest. This notably included player [[Steve Timmons]], sacrificing his trademark red [[flattop]] for the protest. The U.S. team ultimately progressed to the playoffs and won bronze.\n* [[Mike Stulce]] of the United States won the men's [[shot put]], beating the heavily favored [[Werner G\u00fcnth\u00f6r]] of Switzerland.\n* On the 20th anniversary of the [[Munich massacre]] and the 500th anniversary of the [[Alhambra Decree]], [[Yael Arad]] became the first [[Israel]]i to win an Olympic medal, winning a silver medal in judo. The next day, [[Oren Smadja]] became Israel's first male medalist, winning a bronze in the same sport.\n* [[Derek Redmond]] of Great Britain tore a hamstring during a 400-meter semi-final heat. As he struggled to finish the race, his father entered the track without credentials and helped him complete the race, to a [[standing ovation]] from the crowd.\n* [[Gail Devers]] came into the 100 meters hurdles as the favorite. Though her Olympic history shows her winning the 100 meters dash twice, the first time earlier in this Olympics, she primarily made her career as a hurdler. And true to form, Devers had a commanding lead in this race, until the final hurdle. Devers came up short and hit the hurdle, foot first, hard, knocking her off balance. She stumbled toward the finish line, falling on the last step, but still finished fifth, .001 out of fourth place.\n* [[Jennifer Capriati]] won the singles tennis competition at the age of 16. She had previously earned a spot in the semifinals of two grand slams at the age of 14.\n* Two gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of \"8.7\" instead of the intended \"9.7\" in the computerized scoring system for one of [[Sylvie Fr\u00e9chette]]'s figures. This error ultimately placed Fr\u00e9chette second, leaving [[Kristen Babb-Sprague]] for the gold medal.

For the first time, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as independent nations after their [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia|separation from Socialist Yugoslavia]], and [[Namibia]] and the unified team of [[Yemen]] (previously North and South Yemen) also made their Olympic debuts.\n\nThe 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964, while South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years.\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was banned due to [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as [[Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Participants]].

As he struggled to finish the race, his father entered the track without credentials and helped him complete the race, to a [[standing ovation]] from the crowd.\n* [[Gail Devers]] came into the 100 meters hurdles as the favorite. Though her Olympic history shows her winning the 100 meters dash twice, the first time earlier in this Olympics, she primarily made her career as a hurdler. And true to form, Devers had a commanding lead in this race, until the final hurdle. Devers came up short and hit the hurdle, foot first, hard, knocking her off balance. She stumbled toward the finish line, falling on the last step, but still finished fifth, .001 out of fourth place.\n* [[Jennifer Capriati]] won the singles tennis competition at the age of 16. She had previously earned a spot in the semifinals of two grand slams at the age of 14.\n* Two gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of \"8.7\" instead of the intended \"9.7\" in the computerized scoring system for one of [[Sylvie Fr\u00e9chette]]'s figures.

For the first time, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as independent nations after their [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia|separation from Socialist Yugoslavia]], and [[Namibia]] and the unified team of [[Yemen]] (previously North and South Yemen) also made their Olympic debuts.\n\nThe 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964, while South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years.\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was banned due to [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as [[Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Participants]].

In a common variant, the '''suspended span''', the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central [[truss bridge]] which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:CooperRiverBridge.svg|500px|thumb|center|A diagram of the parts of the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] ]]\n{{clear}}\n\nA common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a '''balanced cantilever'''; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called '''anchor arms'''. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the upper members and [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore [[statically determinate]] with no members carrying mixed loads.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using [[Segmental bridge|segmental construction]].\n\n== Construction methods==\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the [[Navajo Bridge]]) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a [[truss arch bridge]]. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.\n\n[[File:SFOBB-OldEastSpanDismantleCropped.png|500px|thumb|center|The old eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction.

In a common variant, the '''suspended span''', the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central [[truss bridge]] which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:CooperRiverBridge.svg|500px|thumb|center|A diagram of the parts of the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] ]]\n{{clear}}\n\nA common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a '''balanced cantilever'''; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called '''anchor arms'''. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the upper members and [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore [[statically determinate]] with no members carrying mixed loads.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using [[Segmental bridge|segmental construction]].\n\n== Construction methods==\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the [[Navajo Bridge]]) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a [[truss arch bridge]]. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.\n\n[[File:SFOBB-OldEastSpanDismantleCropped.png|500px|thumb|center|The old eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction.

Because of his success with  of ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' published in 1836 Dickens was asked by the publisher [[Chapman & Hall]] to supply descriptions to explain a series of comic \"cockney sporting plates\" by illustrator [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]],<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Pickwick Papers|first=Wilbur L. |last= Cross |authorlink=Wilbur L. Cross |inline=1}}</ref> and to connect them into a novel. The book became Britain's the first real publishing phenomenon, with bootleg copies, theatrical performances, Sam Weller joke books, and other merchandise. \n\nSeymour's widow claimed that the idea for the novel was originally her husband's, but Dickens strenuously denied any specific input in his preface to the 1867 edition: \"Mr Seymour never originated or suggested an incident, a phrase, or a word, to be found in the book.\"<ref>C. Dickens, ''The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club'' (1867 reprint), p.8</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nDickens was working as a Parliamentary reporter and a roving journalist at age 24, and he had published a collection of sketches on London life as ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''. Publisher [[Chapman & Hall]] was projecting a series of \"cockney sporting plates\" by illustrator Robert Seymour. There was to be a club, the members of which were to be sent on hunting and fishing expeditions into the country. Their guns were to go off by accident, and fishhooks were to get caught in their hats and trousers, and these and other misadventures were to be depicted in Seymour's comic plates.<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Pickwick Papers|first=Wilbur L. |last= Cross |authorlink=Wilbur L. Cross |inline=1}}</ref> They asked Dickens to supply the description necessary to explain the plates and to connect them into a sort of picture novel that was fashionable at the time. He protested that he knew nothing of sport, but still accepted the commission.<ref name=ea/>\n\nOnly in a few instances did Dickens adjust his narrative to plates that had been prepared for him. Typically, he led the way with an instalment of his story, and the artist was compelled to illustrate what Dickens had already written. The story thus became the prime source of interest and the illustrations merely of secondary importance.<ref name=ea/> Seymour provided the illustrations for the first two instalments before his suicide. [[Robert William Buss]] illustrated the third instalment, but Dickens did not like his work, so the remaining instalments were illustrated by Phiz ([[Hablot Knight Browne]]) who illustrated most of Dickens' subsequent novels.

Because of his success with  of ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' published in 1836 Dickens was asked by the publisher [[Chapman & Hall]] to supply descriptions to explain a series of comic \"cockney sporting plates\" by illustrator [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]],<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Pickwick Papers|first=Wilbur L. |last= Cross |authorlink=Wilbur L. Cross |inline=1}}</ref> and to connect them into a novel. The book became Britain's the first real publishing phenomenon, with bootleg copies, theatrical performances, Sam Weller joke books, and other merchandise. \n\nSeymour's widow claimed that the idea for the novel was originally her husband's, but Dickens strenuously denied any specific input in his preface to the 1867 edition: \"Mr Seymour never originated or suggested an incident, a phrase, or a word, to be found in the book.\"<ref>C. Dickens, ''The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club'' (1867 reprint), p.8</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nDickens was working as a Parliamentary reporter and a roving journalist at age 24, and he had published a collection of sketches on London life as ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''. Publisher [[Chapman & Hall]] was projecting a series of \"cockney sporting plates\" by illustrator Robert Seymour. There was to be a club, the members of which were to be sent on hunting and fishing expeditions into the country. Their guns were to go off by accident, and fishhooks were to get caught in their hats and trousers, and these and other misadventures were to be depicted in Seymour's comic plates.<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Pickwick Papers|first=Wilbur L. |last= Cross |authorlink=Wilbur L. Cross |inline=1}}</ref> They asked Dickens to supply the description necessary to explain the plates and to connect them into a sort of picture novel that was fashionable at the time. He protested that he knew nothing of sport, but still accepted the commission.<ref name=ea/>\n\nOnly in a few instances did Dickens adjust his narrative to plates that had been prepared for him. Typically, he led the way with an instalment of his story, and the artist was compelled to illustrate what Dickens had already written. The story thus became the prime source of interest and the illustrations merely of secondary importance.<ref name=ea/> Seymour provided the illustrations for the first two instalments before his suicide. [[Robert William Buss]] illustrated the third instalment, but Dickens did not like his work, so the remaining instalments were illustrated by Phiz ([[Hablot Knight Browne]]) who illustrated most of Dickens' subsequent novels. The instalments were first published in book form in 1837.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dickens|first=Charles|title=The posthumous papers of the Pickwick Club|publisher=[[Open Library]]|ol=23001437M}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n\n[[File:The Writings of Charles Dickens v1 p4 (engraving).jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Robert Seymour illustration depicting Pickwick addressing the club]]\n\n''The Pickwick Papers'' is a sequence of loosely related adventures written for serialization in a periodical.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother. It was used as a formal way of addressing an old woman at the time. See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin_dynasty|Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).<ref>{{cite web |last1=. |first1=\u4e09\u4e09\u4e24\u4e24 |title=\u5289\u90a6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8d0f\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\uff1f |url=https://www.0-news.info/history/liubang-de-chenggong-zhi-dao/ |url=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother.

See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin_dynasty|Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).<ref>{{cite web |first1=\u4e09\u4e09\u4e24\u4e24 |title=\u5289\u90a6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8d0f\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\uff1f |url=https://www.0-news.info/history/%E5%8A%89%E9%82%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B9%8B%E9%81%93/ |website=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him.

There are four films in the franchise-\u2013''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2010), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'' (2015), and ''[[Insidious: The Last Key]]'' (2018)--which have grossed a total of $539{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a combined budget of $26.5{{nbsp}}million.\n\nThe first two films were directed by Wan, the third by Whannell, who also served as the screenwriter for all four films. [[Adam Robitel]] directed the fourth installment. [[FilmDistrict]] released the first and second films, while [[Focus Features]] and [[Universal Pictures]] handled the third and fourth, respectively.\n\nThe first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an [[astral plane]], are continuously haunted by demons of a hellish realm known as ''the Further'' until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead, and the fourth follows her when her own family becomes haunted. All plots are depicted as case files of [[demonologist]]s.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Insidious'' (2010)===\n{{main article|Insidious (film)}}\n\n''Insidious'' was directed by [[James Wan|Wan]], written by [[Leigh Whannell|Whannell]], and starred [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].

A sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'', was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter. The film's success led to it being used as inspiration for a maze in Universal's 2013 [[Halloween Horror Nights]].\n\n===''Insidious: Chapter 2'' (2013)===\n{{main article|Insidious: Chapter 2}}\n\n''Insidious: Chapter 2'' was also directed by Wan and written by Whannell.

[[Adam Robitel]] directed the fourth installment. [[FilmDistrict]] released the first and second films, while [[Focus Features]] and [[Universal Pictures]] handled the third and fourth, respectively.\n\nThe first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an [[astral plane]], are continuously haunted by demons of a hellish realm known as ''the Further'' until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead, and the fourth follows her when her own family becomes haunted. All plots are depicted as case files of [[demonologist]]s.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Insidious'' (2010)===\n{{main article|Insidious (film)}}\n\n''Insidious'' was directed by [[James Wan|Wan]], written by [[Leigh Whannell|Whannell]], and starred [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].

A sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'', was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter. The film's success led to it being used as inspiration for a maze in Universal's 2013 [[Halloween Horror Nights]].\n\n===''Insidious: Chapter 2'' (2013)===\n{{main article|Insidious: Chapter 2}}\n\n''Insidious: Chapter 2'' was also directed by Wan and written by Whannell.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old [[trade route]]s could also have played a role. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 5th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Macauley Richardson |first=Lloyd |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |title=Books: Eurasian Exploration |work=Policy Review |publisher=Hoover Institution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216043007/http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with western Europe.<ref>Crone, Patricia.

The [[Jutes]] invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from [[Jutland]] during the [[Age of Migrations]], before the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] settled there. The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

Its inhabitants were known as [[Jomsvikings]]. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the [[Oder]] estuary.<ref>[[T. D. Kendrick]], ''A History of the Vikings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 179ff, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43396-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Viking Age===\nDuring the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Byzantium]]. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age about Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages.\n\n====Runestones====\n{{Main|Runestone}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = U 240, Lingsberg.JPG\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Lingberg Runestone\n| caption1  = The [[Lingsberg Runestone]] in Sweden\n| image2    = Jellingsten stor 2.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Jelling Stones\n| caption2  = Runic inscriptions of the larger of the [[Jelling Stones]] in Denmark\n| footer    = Two types of Norse runestones from the Viking Age\n}}\nThe Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called ''runor'', built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well crafted jewellery like [[brooch]]es, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings.

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear.

Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows.

Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Ages]].

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include [[The Vikings (reenactment)|The Vikings]] and [[Regia Anglorum]], though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of [[Minnesota]].\n\nDuring the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as ''[[\u00fatr\u00e1sarv\u00edkingar]]'' (roughly 'raiding Vikings').<ref>Ann-Sofie Nielsen Gremaud, \u2018[https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8692 The Vikings are coming!

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of ''[[Geatish Society|G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet]]'', founded in 1811 in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roberta |title=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber |year=2000 |publisher=Ed.

This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture.\n\nThe latter-day ''mythos'' created by [[National Romanticism|national romantic ideas]] blended the Viking Age with aspects of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in [[petroglyph]]s and appeared in archaeological finds (see [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Vikso]] helmets).

People from the Viken area were not called \"Viking\" in Old Norse manuscripts, but are referred to as ''v\u00edkverir'', ('V\u00edk dwellers'). In addition, that explanation could explain only the masculine (''v\u00edkingr'') and not the feminine (''v\u00edking''), which is a serious problem because the masculine is easily derived from the feminine but hardly the other way around.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/viking%20rowshift.pdf|title=''V\u00edking'' \u2013 'rower shifting'?

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted.

The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists.

They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships.\n}}\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions.

A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader.

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]).

[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear.

Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows.

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, pp. 362\u201364</ref> In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven.

This results in a fast turnaround time, with all vehicles and passengers embarking and disembarking in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The loading facilities are also used by the [[MV Sorrento (2001)|MV ''Sorrento'']], the earlier ''Peninsula Princess'' used a different ramp at Queenscliff.\n\nAt Queenscliff, the ship docks bow into the terminal. The bow of the ship consists of two sections; one section raises whilst the other lowers forming a ramp that allows vehicles to drive off.

This results in a fast turnaround time, with all vehicles and passengers embarking and disembarking in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The loading facilities are also used by the [[MV Sorrento (2001)|MV ''Sorrento'']], the earlier ''Peninsula Princess'' used a different ramp at Queenscliff.\n\nAt Queenscliff, the ship docks bow into the terminal. The bow of the ship consists of two sections; one section raises whilst the other lowers forming a ramp that allows vehicles to drive off.
