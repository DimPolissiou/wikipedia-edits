The case is also influential in [[negligence]] in the [[English law of tort]] (even though [[English law]] does not recognise \"[[allurement]]\" ''per se'').\n\nThe case's main significance is that, after the shift within the [[common law]] of [[English law of negligence|negligence]] from [[strict liability]]<ref>As in ''[[Re Polemis]]''</ref> to a reasonable standard of care,<ref>As in [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' and  ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''</ref> this case advocated a middle way, namely: \n*Even if the loss or harm is not itself foreseeable, liability may arise provided the actual loss falls with a \"foreseeable class of harm\". \nThis idea was neither developed nor expanded upon, and only one year later the claimant in ''[[Doughty v Turner Manufacturing]]'' obtained no remedy ''via'' this \"middle way\".<ref>[http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/Doughty-v-Turner-Manufacturing-Company.php ''Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company'' case report]</ref><ref>Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company [1964] 1 QB 518</ref> However, the case was followed in subsequent cases on [[occupiers' liability]].\n\n==Facts==\nOne evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10<ref>The older boy was the younger boy's uncle.</ref> were walking down Russell Road, [[Edinburgh]] where some [[Post Office]] workers were repairing cables under the street. The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it, with an access ladder inside. From mid-afternoon onwards, the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps. The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby; before leaving, they withdrew the ladder, leaving it outside the tent.\n\nWhile the workmen were out, the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment. They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent. They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole, after which they safely climbed out again. The younger boy tripped over the lamp, which fell into the manhole and broke. The paraffin leaked and vaporised, causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet. The impact of the blast caused the 8-year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries.\n\nThe question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site  unattended with the lamps burning. Under Scots law, they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the  site becoming an \"allurement\" for the boys; had they discharged this duty? On the other hand, the children were trespassers and possibly contributorily negligent. A crucial issue was the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the presence of children on Russell Road, and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries  was of \"different type than that could have been foreseeable\".\n\nThe court of first instance, the [[First Division of the Court of Session]], limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable. The defence had argued that the boys were not only [[trespassers]] but also [[contributory negligence|contributorily negligent]], but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass; and taking into consideration the youth of the boy, it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligent; and these points were dropped on appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).\n\n==Judgment on appeal==\n[[David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]] affirmed the existence of a duty of care by applying the test formulated by [[Lord Atkin]] in ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'',<ref>''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562]</ref><ref>In ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'' Lord Atkin had declared that you take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.\"</ref> saying:  \"the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passer-by ... It was therefore their duty that such passerby, \"neighbour\" in the language of ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'', were, so far as reasonably practicable, protected from the various obstacles or allurements, which the workmen had brought to the site. It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkin's test.\"\n\n[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] stated that \"exercising an ordinary, and certainly not an over-exacting, degree of prevention the workmen should have decided, when the tea-break came, that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children,\" thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care.\n\nIn both the First Division and in the House of Lords, the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road, \"a quiet road, some four hundred yards away from any houses\". Lord Morris opined (following the judgement of Lord Ordinary) that \"if, of, course, there was no likelihood that children might appear, different considerations would apply. But children did appear, and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated.\"\n\n[[Christopher Guest, Baron Guest|Lord Guest]] declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent; and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this. Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children, and that that, \"... the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them.\"\n\nIt was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp. According to Lord Reid, the boy's injuries from burns was foreseeable. Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected, this was no defence. However, if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability.\n\n[[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] continued that as the cause of the accident &ndash; the explosion from paraffin lamp &ndash; was known, it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source, rather than the fault of respondent. Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question \"was but a variant of foreseeable\" and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner.\n\nLord Jenkins agreed, finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded.\n\n[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] agreed, saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree, but was \"of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable\". He said the respondent \"should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way\" in which the boy might play with the equipment, or the way in which he might get hurt. Allowing the appeal, Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn't envisage \"the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident.\"\n\nLord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable, but only that \"the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type\". He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion; to Lord Guest it was a non-essential element. He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event. The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event, but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event. Lord Guest argued this as a \"fallacious\" claim. Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees, who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident.\n\n[[Lord Pearce]] cited the case of ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]'' which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person. It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place.\n\nIn sum, all the judges allowed the boy's appeal. The decision was followed in ''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'',<ref>''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/31.html 1 WLR 1082]</ref>\n\n(For a similar case arising under [[US law]], see ''[[Palsgraf v.

English and Dutch also began to disseminate with initially smaller empires. Following the [[Reconquista]], the [[Inquisition]] posed a serious threat to some Jewish languages. [[Shuadit]], also known as Jud\u00e6o-Occitan appeared in French documents back to the 11th century but steeply declined, until the death of its last speaker [[Armand Lunel]] much later in 1977.\n\nThe Spanish [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] in the 1400s drove the Berber [[Guanche language]] to extinction. Earlier, in 1341, the Genovese explorer [[Nicoloso da Recco]] encountered and partially documented the language, which is also recorded in [[Punic]] and [[Libyco-Berber]] rock inscriptions. \n\nThe [[Age of Discovery]] began the creation of new creoles and pidgins among enslaved people and trading communities. Some people in the Solombala port in [[Arkhangelsk]] in northern Russia spoke  [[Solombala-English]], a Russian-English pidgin, in the 18th and 19th centuries in an unusual example of a trade-related pidgin.  \n\nSome of the oldest documented sign languages among deaf communities date to the early modern period. Congenital deafness was widespread in villages in Kent, England, leading to the rise of [[Old Kentish Sign Language]] which may be recorded in diaries of [[Samuel Pepys]]. [[Old French Sign Language]] spoken in Paris in the 18th century competes as one of the oldest European sign languages. \n\nThree Baltic languages, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Selonian language|Selonian]] and [[Semigallian language|Semigallian]] were assimilated to Lithuanian in the 16th century.

During the [[Greek genocide]], almost all Greek speakers were purged from Turkey and killed or deported to Greece. As a result, speakers of [[Cappadocian Greek]], which had split off of Medieval Greek after the Seljuq Turk victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, were forced to leave for Greece. Most Cappadocian Greek speakers shifted quickly to Modern Greek and linguists presumed that the language was extinct by the 1960s. However, in 2005, [[Mark Janse]] and Dimitris Papazachariou found that up to 2800 third-generation speakers were still using the language in Northern and Central Greece. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lmgd.philology.upatras.gr/index.php/en/10-ne/27-2014-02-28-08-26-57|title=Laboratory of Ancient Greek Dialects|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Patras|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish.

In the Atacama Desert in Chile, the last speaker of [[Kunza]] language isolate was found in 1949, with the final shift to Spanish completed at some point in the 1950s. The [[Ona language]] spoken by [[Selk'nam people]] in Tierra del Fuego went extinct around the early 1980s, although some sources suggest a handful of speakers still existed around 2014. <ref name=Adelaar>Adelaar, Willem (2010). \"South America\".

AHQ was invited to join the Garena Premier League (GPL)'s 2013 spring season to face teams such as the [[Taipei Assassins]] and the Singapore Sentinels. In March, westdoor and Lantyr both joined AHQ and became the team's main players. They finished the GPL spring season 2013 in third place.\n\nIn GPL Summer 2013, the team improved from the previous year, beating the Taipei Assassins and the Singapore Sentinels and winning the season with a 24-4 record. They made it to the GPL Finals to face the winner of the Spring Season, the Taipei Assassins. At the same time, AHQ also joined TeSL{{clarify|date=April 2018}} and met the other strong team in Taiwan, the Taipei Snipers. AHQ finished TeSL in second place.\n\nThe team beat TPA in the 2013 GPL Finals. At the [[Season 3 World Championship]], they were beaten by the TeSL team Gamania Bears.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nAfter Season 3, AHQ acquired Naz from Wayi Spider while Lantyr moved to AHQ Fighter. AHQ won 20 matches and only lost one game in the 2014 LNL Winter. However, in 2014 GPL Winter, they lost to the Taipei Snipers and placed third.\n\nAHQ had a successful run in 2014 GPL Spring group stages, where they achieved a record of 9-1. In the playoffs, they dominated the Singapore Sentinels 3-0 in the quarterfinals before dispatching the Saigon Jokers 3-1 in the semifinals. In the finals, however, they lost to the [[Taipei Assassins]] 2-3 and ended playoffs in second place.\n\n2014 GPL Summer, starting in June 2014, featured another successful run in the group stages by AHQ, when they achieved an 8-2 record. In the playoffs, they won 3-0 against the Bangkok Titans in the quarterfinals, and won 3-1 against Logitech G Fighter in the semifinals, mirroring their performance earlier in the year. (Full Louis got disqualified from GPL this season due to using players who were not 17 years of age, SofM, and Jeff. Logitech G Fighter replaced them with playing in the semifinals). Unfortunately, they went on to lose to the Taipei Assassins 0-3 in the finals, achieving another second place record in the playoffs.\n\nWhile they were unable to become the champions of 2014 GPL Summer, their dominating performance in the 2014 Garena Regional Finals (where they emerged as the number-one seed in the Taiwan and SEA{{clarify|date=April 2019}} region by beating the Saigon Fantastic Five in the finals) allowed them to participate in the [[2014 Season World Championship]].\n\nSeeded into Group A of the [[2014 Season World Championship]] in Taiwan, the team played against [[EDward Gaming]], [[Samsung White]] and [[Dark Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esports.dailygame.co.kr/view.php?ud=2014092122491859233|title=[\ub864\ub4dc\ucef5] ahq, EDG \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \ub300\uc5ed\uc804\uadf9!|first=Yun-seong|last=Nam|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref> AHQ's 3-3 record qualified them for a [[tiebreaker]] into the bracket, where they lost to [[EDward Gaming]].\n\n==== 2015 ====\nAfter a disappointing run in the 2014 Season World Championship, AHQ acquired Mountain and OhReaL from Logitech Snipers, Ziv from HK Attitude Mage, and MrAlbis from Logitech G Fighter. Naz and GarnetDevil left, while Prydz became the analyst.\n\nThe new roster qualified for [[IEM Season IX - Taipei]] in IEM Season IX, where they won 2-0 against the Logitech Snipers, 2-0 against Hong Kong Esports, and 2-1 against the [[Yoe Flash Wolves]] in the winner's bracket finals. At [[IEM Season IX - Taipei]], AHQ would receive a quarterfinal bye for winning the winner's bracket finals, but would then be defeated 0-2 against the [[Yoe Flash Wolves]].\n\nSeason 5 marked the start of the [[League of Legends Masters Series]], a new league exclusive to teams from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao.

AHQ was invited to join the Garena Premier League (GPL)'s 2013 spring season to face teams such as the [[Taipei Assassins]] and the Singapore Sentinels. In March, westdoor and Lantyr both joined AHQ and became the team's main players. They finished the GPL spring season 2013 in third place.\n\nIn GPL Summer 2013, the team improved from the previous year, beating the Taipei Assassins and the Singapore Sentinels and winning the season with a 24-4 record. They made it to the GPL Finals to face the winner of the Spring Season, the Taipei Assassins. At the same time, AHQ also joined TeSL{{clarify|date=April 2018}} and met the other strong team in Taiwan, the Taipei Snipers. AHQ finished TeSL in second place.\n\nThe team beat TPA in the 2013 GPL Finals. At the [[Season 3 World Championship]], they were beaten by the TeSL team Gamania Bears.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nAfter Season 3, AHQ acquired Naz from Wayi Spider while Lantyr moved to AHQ Fighter. AHQ won 20 matches and only lost one game in the 2014 LNL Winter. However, in 2014 GPL Winter, they lost to the Taipei Snipers and placed third.\n\nAHQ had a successful run in 2014 GPL Spring group stages, where they achieved a record of 9-1. In the playoffs, they dominated the Singapore Sentinels 3-0 in the quarterfinals before dispatching the Saigon Jokers 3-1 in the semifinals. In the finals, however, they lost to the [[Taipei Assassins]] 2-3 and ended playoffs in second place.\n\n2014 GPL Summer, starting in June 2014, featured another successful run in the group stages by AHQ, when they achieved an 8-2 record. In the playoffs, they won 3-0 against the Bangkok Titans in the quarterfinals, and won 3-1 against Logitech G Fighter in the semifinals, mirroring their performance earlier in the year. (Full Louis got disqualified from GPL this season due to using players who were not 17 years of age, SofM, and Jeff. Logitech G Fighter replaced them with playing in the semifinals). Unfortunately, they went on to lose to the Taipei Assassins 0-3 in the finals, achieving another second place record in the playoffs.\n\nWhile they were unable to become the champions of 2014 GPL Summer, their dominating performance in the 2014 Garena Regional Finals (where they emerged as the number-one seed in the Taiwan and SEA{{clarify|date=April 2019}} region by beating the Saigon Fantastic Five in the finals) allowed them to participate in the [[2014 Season World Championship]].\n\nSeeded into Group A of the [[2014 Season World Championship]] in Taiwan, the team played against [[EDward Gaming]], [[Samsung White]] and [[Dark Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esports.dailygame.co.kr/view.php?ud=2014092122491859233|title=[\ub864\ub4dc\ucef5] ahq, EDG \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \ub300\uc5ed\uc804\uadf9!|first=Yun-seong|last=Nam|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref> AHQ's 3-3 record qualified them for a [[tiebreaker]] into the bracket, where they lost to [[EDward Gaming]].\n\n==== 2015 ====\nAfter a disappointing run in the 2014 Season World Championship, AHQ acquired Mountain and OhReaL from Logitech Snipers, Ziv from HK Attitude Mage, and MrAlbis from Logitech G Fighter. Naz and GarnetDevil left, while Prydz became the analyst.\n\nThe new roster qualified for [[IEM Season IX - Taipei]] in IEM Season IX, where they won 2-0 against the Logitech Snipers, 2-0 against Hong Kong Esports, and 2-1 against the [[Yoe Flash Wolves]] in the winner's bracket finals. At [[IEM Season IX - Taipei]], AHQ would receive a quarterfinal bye for winning the winner's bracket finals, but would then be defeated 0-2 against the [[Yoe Flash Wolves]].\n\nSeason 5 marked the start of the [[League of Legends Masters Series]], a new league exclusive to teams from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. AHQ was invited to its qualifiers, where they went 3-0 in their group to earn a berth in the regular season.
