Later, the sphinx image, initially very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit there often interpreted quite differently due to translations of descriptions of the originals and through evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.\n\nSphinx depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal [[tomb]]s or religious temples.\n\n== Egypt ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] -->\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Egypt Gizeh.jpg|thumbnail|Great Sphinx before clearance, Brooklyn Museum Archives]]\n[[File:Back of Sphinx, Giza Egypt.JPG|thumb|Back of the Great Sphinx, Giza, Egypt]]\nThe largest and most famous sphinx is the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], situated on the [[Giza]] Plateau adjacent to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] and facing east ({{coord|29|58|31|N|31|08|15|E|}}). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. While the date of its construction is not known for certain, general consensus among egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx bears the likeness of the pharaoh [[Khafra]], while a fringe minority of late 20th century geologists have claimed evidence of water erosion in and around the Sphinx enclosure which would prove that the Sphinx predates [[Khafra]], a claim that is sometimes referred to as the [[Sphinx water erosion hypothesis]], but which has little support among egyptologists.<ref>Brian Dunning (2019).

At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 BCE inscription on a [[stele]] belonging to the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] lists the names of three aspects of the local sun [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of that period, ''[[Khepera]]\u2013[[R\u00ea]]\u2013[[Atum]]''. Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity [[Sekhmet]], a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], with her likeness carved in [[granite]], which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[alabaster]] [[sphinx of Memphis]] in [[Egypt]], currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing [[Amun|Amon]], were built in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], where his cult was strongest.\n\nThe Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.<ref>Regier, Willis Goth.

An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a \"[[Liminality|liminal]]\" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.\n\n====The riddle in popular culture====\nIn [[Jean Cocteau]]'s retelling of the Oedipus legend, ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]'', the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and [[Anubis]] ascend back to the heavens.\n\nThere are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and parodic interpretations of the Riddle of the Sphinx, and of Oedipus's answer to it.

This [[Shiva Ottam]] (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and [[Bhima]], one of the heroes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n\nThe Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the ''[[Sharabha]]'', a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god [[Shiva]] took on to counter [[Narasimha]]'s violence.\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] {{citation needed span|and [[India]],|date=February 2018}} the sphinx is known as ''narasimha'' or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with [[Narasimha]], the fourth reincarnation of the deity [[Vishnu]]; this [[avatar]] or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The \"sphinx\" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.\n\nIn [[Burma]], the sphinx is known as ''[[Chinthe#Manussiha|manussiha]]'' (''manuthiha''). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist [[stupas]], and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by [[ogre]]sses.\n\nNora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the \"sphinx\" is known in [[Thailand]].

Such sphinxes were revived when the ''[[Grotesque|grottesche]]'' or \"grotesque\" decorations of the unearthed  ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' of [[Nero]] were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the ''[[loggia]]'' of the [[Vatican Palace]] by the workshop of [[Raphael]] (1515\u201320), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman ''grottesche''.\n\nThe first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the [[School of Fontainebleau]] in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the [[Baroque|Late Baroque]] style of the French [[Regence|R\u00e9gence]] (1715&ndash;1723).

Print.</ref>\n\nIn European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the [[Renaissance]]. Later, the sphinx image, initially very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit there often interpreted quite differently due to translations of descriptions of the originals and through evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.\n\nSphinx depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal [[tomb]]s or religious temples.\n\n== Egypt ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] -->\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Egypt Gizeh.jpg|thumbnail|Great Sphinx before clearance, Brooklyn Museum Archives]]\n[[File:Back of Sphinx, Giza Egypt.JPG|thumb|Back of the Great Sphinx, Giza, Egypt]]\nThe largest and most famous sphinx is the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], situated on the [[Giza]] Plateau adjacent to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] and facing east ({{coord|29|58|31|N|31|08|15|E|}}). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. While the date of its construction is not known for certain, general consensus among egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx bears the likeness of the pharaoh [[Khafra]], while a fringe minority of late 20th century geologists have claimed evidence of water erosion in and around the Sphinx enclosure which would prove that the Sphinx predates [[Khafra]], a claim that is sometimes referred to as the [[Sphinx water erosion hypothesis]], but which has little support among egyptologists.<ref>Brian Dunning (2019). [https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4693] ''Skeptoid Podcast'', episode 693 'The Age of the Sphinx'</ref>\n\nWhat names their builders gave to these [[statue]]s is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 BCE inscription on a [[stele]] belonging to the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] lists the names of three aspects of the local sun [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of that period, ''[[Khepera]]\u2013[[R\u00ea]]\u2013[[Atum]]''. Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity [[Sekhmet]], a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], with her likeness carved in [[granite]], which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[alabaster]] [[sphinx of Memphis]], currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing [[Amun|Amon]], were built in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], where his cult was strongest.\n\nThe Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.<ref>Regier, Willis Goth.

An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a \"[[Liminality|liminal]]\" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.\n\n====The riddle in popular culture====\nIn [[Jean Cocteau]]'s retelling of the Oedipus legend, ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]'', the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle.

But they who interpret concerning the Ages of Man are deceived. For a Quadrangle of Four Elements are of all things first to be considered, from thence we come to the Hemisphere having two lines, a Right and a Curve, that is, to the White Luna; from thence to the Triangle which consists of Body, Soul and Spirit, or Sol, Luna and Mercury. Hence [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhasis]] in his Epistles, \"The Stone,\" says he, \"is a Triangle in its essence, a Quadrangle in its quality.\"</blockquote>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Marble stele (grave marker) of a youth and a little girl 530 BCE Greece.jpg|Funerary stele, 530 BCE, [[Greece]].\nFile:Limestone funerary stele (shaft) surmounted by two sphinxes Greece 530 BCE.jpg|Limestone funerary stele (shaft) surmounted by two sphinxes Greece 5th century BCE.\nFile:Marble capital and finial in the form of a sphinx.jpg|Marble capital and finial in the form of a sphinx, 530 BCE.\nFile:Carved tomb in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum - panoramio.jpg|Sphinxes on the [[Lycian sarcophagus of Sidon]] (430\u2013420 BCE).\n</gallery>\n\n== South and Southeast Asia ==\n[[File:Bharhut Gateway Sphinx.jpg|thumb|Buddhist sphinx on a [[stupa]] gateway, [[Bharhut]], 1st century BCE.<ref name=DD/>]]\nA composite mythological being with the body of a lion and the head of a human being is present in the traditions, mythology and art of South and Southeast Asia.<ref>Deekshitar, Raja. \"Discovering the Anthropomorphic Lion in Indian Art.\" in ''Marg.

Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}</ref> the traditions related to the \"Asian sphinxes\" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of \"sphinxes\" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by [[Hellenistic art]] and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|a phase of Hellenistic influence]]. Numerous sphinxes can be seen on the gateways of [[Bharhut]] stupa, dating to the 1st century B.C.<ref name=DD>\"Sphinxes of all sorts occur on the Bharhut gateways\" {{cite book |last1=Kosambi |first1=Damodar Dharmanand |title=Combined Methods in Indology and Other Writings |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195642391 |page=459 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OhtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn South India, the \"sphinx\" is known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit) or ''purushamirugam '' (Tamil), meaning \"human-beast\". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an [[apotropaic]] purpose, just as the \"sphinxes\" in other parts of the ancient world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart.|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}</ref> It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the [[gopuram]] or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the [[sanctum sanctorum]].\n\n[[File:Purushamrigachidambaram01.JPG|thumb|left|Male purushamriga or Indian sphinx guarding the entrance of the Shri Shiva Nataraja temple in [[Chidambaram]]]]\nThe ''purushamriga'' plays a significant role in daily as well as yearly ritual of South Indian [[Shaiva]] temples. In the [[shodhasha-upakaara]] (or sixteen honors) ritual, performed between one and six times at significant sacred moments through the day, it decorates one of the lamps of the [[diparadhana]] or lamp ceremony. And in several temples the ''purushamriga'' is also one of the ''[[vahana]]'' or vehicles of the deity during the processions of the [[Brahmotsava]] or festival.\n[[File:Manokthiha (Manussiha).png|thumb|Burmese depiction of the Manussiha]]\nIn [[Kanyakumari district|Kanya Kumari]] district, in the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, during the night of [[Shiva Ratri]], devotees run 75 kilometres while visiting and worshiping at twelve Shiva temples. This [[Shiva Ottam]] (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and [[Bhima]], one of the heroes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n\nThe Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the ''[[Sharabha]]'', a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god [[Shiva]] took on to counter [[Narasimha]]'s violence.\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] {{citation needed span|and [[India]],|date=February 2018}} the sphinx is known as ''narasimha'' or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with [[Narasimha]], the fourth reincarnation of the deity [[Vishnu]]; this [[avatar]] or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The \"sphinx\" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.\n\nIn [[Burma]], the sphinx is known as ''[[Chinthe#Manussiha|manussiha]]'' (''manuthiha''). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist [[stupas]], and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by [[ogre]]sses.\n\nNora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the \"sphinx\" is known in [[Thailand]]. They are depicted as upright walking beings with the lower body of a lion or deer, and the upper body of a human. Often they are found as female-male pairs. Here, too, the sphinx serves a protective function. It also is enumerated among the mythological creatures that inhabit the ranges of the sacred mountain [[Himapan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.himmapan.com/himmapan_lion_thepnorasri.html |title=Thep Norasri |publisher=Himmapan.com |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== Europe ==\n[[File:La Granja de San Ildefonso Sfinx01.jpg|thumb|[[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], Spain, mid-18th century]]\n\nThe revived [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sphinx of the late 15th century is sometimes thought of as the \"French sphinx\". Her coiffed head is erect and she has the breasts of a young woman. Often she wears ear drops and [[pearl]]s as ornaments. Her body is naturalistically rendered as a recumbent lioness. Such sphinxes were revived when the ''[[Grotesque|grottesche]]'' or \"grotesque\" decorations of the unearthed  ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' of [[Nero]] were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the ''[[loggia]]'' of the [[Vatican Palace]] by the workshop of [[Raphael]] (1515\u201320), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman ''grottesche''.\n\nThe first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the [[School of Fontainebleau]] in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the [[Baroque|Late Baroque]] style of the French [[Regence|R\u00e9gence]] (1715&ndash;1723). From France, she spread throughout Europe, becoming a regular feature of the outdoors decorative sculpture of 18th-century palace gardens, as in the [[Belvedere (palace)|Upper Belvedere Palace]] in [[Vienna]], [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] in Spain, [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok]], or the late [[Rococo]] examples in the grounds of the Portuguese [[Queluz National Palace]] (of perhaps the 1760s), with [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]]s and clothed chests ending with a little cape.\n\n[[File:Fernand Khnopff 002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|''Caresses'' (1896) by [[Fernand Khnopff]], a [[Symbolist]] depiction of [[Oedipus]] and the Sphinx<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/-/_AGlYSd0kETwGw |title=Caresses |author= Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |author-link=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |year=2017 |publisher=Google Arts and Culture}}</ref>]]\n\nSphinxes are a feature of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior decorations of [[Robert Adam]] and his followers, returning closer to the undressed style of the ''grottesche''. They had an equal appeal to artists and designers of the [[Romanticism]] and subsequent [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] movements in the 19th century. Most of these sphinxes alluded to the Greek sphinx and the myth of [[Oedipus]], rather than the Egyptian, although they may not have wings.\n\n== Freemasonry ==\n[[File:Sphinx at Salt Lake Masonic Temple, Utah.JPG|thumb|Sphinx adopted as an emblem in [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture]]\n\nThe sphinx imagery has historically been adopted into [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture and symbology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1995/11/05/from-satan-to-the-sphinx-the-masonic-mysteries-of-dcs-map/9bff53f2-0fa5-4149-bcae-6b8a2c77203d/|title=From Satan to The Sphinx: The Masonic Mysteries of D.C.'s Map|last=Freund|first=Charles Paul|date=5 November 1995|website=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\nAmong the Egyptians, sphinxes were placed at the entrance of the temples to guard their mysteries, by warning those who penetrated within that they should conceal a knowledge of them from the uninitiated. [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion|Champollion]] said that the sphinx became successively the symbol of each of the gods. The placement of the sphinxes expressed the idea that all the gods were hidden from the people, and that the knowledge of them, guarded in the sanctuaries, was revealed to initiates only.\n\nAs a Masonic emblem, the sphinx has been adopted as a symbol of mystery, and as such often is found as a decoration sculptured in front of Masonic temples, or engraved at the head of Masonic documents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-lost-symbols-masonic-temple-151145416/|title=The Lost Symbol's Masonic Temple|last=Taylor|first=David A.|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> It cannot, however, be properly called an ancient, recognized symbol of the order.

{"title_page": "Overtime (ice hockey)", "text_new": "{{short description|Additional ice hockey period to break ties}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}\n'''Overtime''' is a method of determining a winner in an [[ice hockey]] game when the score is tied after regulation. The main methods of determining a winner in a tied game are the overtime period (commonly referred to as '''overtime'''), the [[Penalty shootout|shootout]], or a combination of both. If league rules dictate a finite time in which overtime may be played, with no penalty shoot-out to follow, the game's winning team may or may not be necessarily determined.\n\n==Overtime periods==\n[[File:American Hockey League ERI 5695 (5528600480).jpg|thumb|right|A scoreboard showing an overtime period. Since there are typically three periods in hockey, the fourth period is the overtime period.]]\n'''Overtime periods''' are extra [[Ice hockey#Periods and overtime|period]]s beyond the third regulation period during a game, where normal hockey rules apply. Although in the past, full-length overtime periods were played, overtimes today are ''[[golden goal]]'' (a form of ''[[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]''), meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a [[goal (ice hockey)|goal]].\n\n=== North American overtime ===\nFrom November 21, 1942,<ref>NHL Guide</ref> when overtime (an extra period of 10 minutes duration) was eliminated due to war time restrictions and continuing until the [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1983\u201384]] season, all [[National Hockey League|NHL]] regular-season games tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties. On June 23, 1983, the NHL introduced a regular-season overtime period of five minutes. If the five-minute overtime period ended with no scoring, the game ended as a tie. (The World Hockey Association had used a 10-minute, sudden death regular season overtime period during its seven-year existence.) In the first games to go to overtime, on October 5, 1983, the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to a 3\u20133 tie, and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6\u20136. The first regular-season game decided by overtime was on October 8, 1983, as the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8\u20137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/first454.html |title=World's first regular season NHL overtime game |publisher=Thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com |date= |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1987\u201388 AHL season|1987\u201388]] and since [[1995\u201396 AHL season|1995]], the [[American Hockey League]] has awarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss (OTL). In 1998, the AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five-minute overtime period with four skaters and a goaltender, rather than at full strength (five skaters), except in two-man advantage situations. In a two-man advantage situation, the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against three skaters. The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and [[ECHL]] the next season.\n\n[[Alexander Ovechkin|Alex Ovechkin]] has the record for most NHL overtime goals with 20.\n\nIn the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] and in all [[one-game playoff|tiebreaker games]], overtime periods are played like regulation periods except for the [[golden goal]] rule \u2013 in an overtime period, the game ends when one team scores a goal; the teams are at full strength (five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods. Four of the game's legendary players, [[Mark Messier]] (109 playoff goals), [[Mario Lemieux]] (77 goals), [[Gordie Howe]] (68 goals), and [[Alexander Ovechkin|Alex Ovechkin]] (65 goals) never scored a playoff overtime goal.\n\nIn many leagues (including the NHL for regular-season games since the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]]) and in international competitions, a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime may lead to a shootout. Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether and end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation. In the [[ECHL]], the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice (up to two additional players) for each penalty. If the penalised player returns to the ice, the game becomes 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 until the next stoppage of play, when it becomes 3-on-3. Prior to the [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315 season]], the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] set the overtime period at seven minutes,<ref name=dandc71014/> but reverted to the now-standard five-minute period the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theahl.com/board-of-governors-approves-changes-for-15-16|title=Board of Governors approves changes for 15\u201316|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}</ref> The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety of a five-minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the NHL on June 24, 2015, for use in the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=771982 |title=Board of Governors OKs 3-on-3 OT, coach's challenge |last1=Rosen |first1=Dan |date=June 24, 2015 |website=www.nhl.com |publisher=National Hockey League |access-date=June 25, 2015 |quote=}}</ref> The [[ECHL]] has changed the overtime to seven minutes for the 2019\u201320 season.\n\n=== International overtime ===\nIn [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] play, rules for overtime depend on the stage of the competition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew overtime procedures debuted at the [[2019 IIHF World Championship]] that will be in effect for all IIHF championships, including starting at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. All overtime periods will be 3-on-3 regardless of round robin or preliminary (five minutes with a three-round shootout), knockout rounds including third place games (ten minutes with a five-round shootout), or the championship (twenty minutes, no shootout). In the championship game only, if that overtime is scoreless, a full intermission will be conducted before the procedure repeats. The overtime ends on whoever scores next. In all cases, teams will change ends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iihf.com/en/events/2019/wm/news/8090/new-ot-format-at-worlds|title=New OT format at Worlds|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Shootout==\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Peter Mueller (ice hockey)|Peter Mueller]] of the [[Arizona Coyotes]] (white jersey) scoring a shootout goal on [[Evgeni Nabakov]] of the [[San Jose Sharks]] (teal jersey).]]\n[[File:Jason Williams shootout vs Fleury 2010-01-31.JPG|thumb|150px|right| [[Jason Williams (ice hockey)|Jason Williams]] of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] attempting a shootout shot on [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury]].]]\n\n===International shootouts===\nIn international competition, '''shootouts''' (or more formally, '''game-winning shots (GWS)''', and, in some European countries, '''bullets,''' or '''bullits'''<ref>Jeff Z. Klein, \"Hockey Night in Europe: Goodbye, Columbus\", ''New York Times'', October 25, 2008.</ref><ref>V. Lychyk, \"English borrowings in recent Soviet Russian\", ''Papers and Studies in Contrastive Linguistics'' 29 (1994), p. 153.</ref>), are often used. Each coach selects three skaters from their team to take [[penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]s one at a time against the opposing [[goaltender]], with teams alternating shots. Each team gets one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before then (ex. a team gains a two-goal lead with only one round left). If the shootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a time (with each team taking one additional shot) until there is a winner.\n\nThe IIHF first adopted the game-winning-shot procedure in 1992 when a new playoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a winner for each game. At that time, the shootout was five rounds and only used for knock-out games. In 2006, it was reduced to three rounds and used for all games, eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events. Tie-breaker rounds are still used as needed, and the same or new players can take the tie-break shots, which is also done in reverse order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/home/format-rules.html |title=Format & Rules |publisher=Iihf.com |date= |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> As of May 2016, all IIHF preliminary round games that are not decided by overtime, are decided by a three-round shootout.

The standard five-man shootout is used after four-on-four overtime for all minor leagues in North America. The AHL switched to the NHL formatted three-man shootout for the 2014\u201315 season.<ref name=dandc71014>{{cite web|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/hockeyozone/2014/07/10/ot-in-ahl-now-7-minutes/12485519/|title=AHL extends OT to 7 minutes, adds 3-on-3 portion|website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Collegiate Hockey Association added the shootout as of the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nFollowing the lead of minor leagues, in the NHL's first post-lockout season of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], the league ends exhibition and regular season games still tied after a five-minute-length, three-skaters-per-side overtime period (as of the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]] onwards) with a shootout. The NHL format is a three-round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as needed. All skaters (except goalies) on a team's roster must shoot before any player can shoot a second time. On December 16, 2014 the longest shootout in NHL history went to 20 rounds before [[Nick Bjugstad]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] scored to defeat the [[Washington Capitals]]; the previous record was 15 rounds.<ref name=\"nhl\">{{cite news|title=Panthers outlast Capitals in longest NHL shootout when Nick Bjugstad scores in 20th round|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/panthers-outlast-capitals-in-longest-nhl-shootout-when-nick-bjugstad-scores-in-20th-round/c-744341|accessdate=January 15, 2017|publisher=NHL.com|date=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe shootout is not used in the playoffs for any North American league. Instead, full 20-minute overtime periods are played until [[golden goal|one team scores a goal]].\n\nIn the [[National Hockey League]] and [[American Hockey League]] All-Star Skills Competitions, the competition ends in a penalty shootout known as the ''Breakaway Relay''.\n\n===Tactics===\n[[File:American Hockey League ERI 5728 (5528017555).jpg|thumb|150px|right|A shootout between the [[Providence Bruins]] ([[Boston Bruins]] [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate) and [[Bridgeport Sound Tigers]] ([[New York Islanders]] [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate)]]\nTactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goalie. Both shooters and goalies commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player's style of play. Shooters often consider the goalie's strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick [[Save (ice hockey)|save]]), preferred goaltending style (such as [[Butterfly style|butterfly]] or [[stand-up style|stand-up]]) and method of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter's shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter.\n\nMost shooters attempt to [[deke (ice hockey)|out-deke]] the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance. Former [[Detroit Red Wings]] forward [[Pavel Datsyuk]] and [[New York Rangers]] forward [[Martin St. Louis]] are examples of players who commonly use this tactic. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as [[list of ice hockey terminology|sniping]]. This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening). Former NHL forwards [[Markus N\u00e4slund]] and [[Brett Hull]] are two players commonly referred to as [[list of ice hockey terminology|snipers]]. Very rarely a shooter may take a [[slapshot]] or [[wrist shot]] from the [[point (ice hockey)|point]] or top of the [[slot (ice hockey)|slot]]. This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise. Retired player [[Brian Rolston]], [[Detroit Red Wings]] winger [[Todd Bertuzzi]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]] defenseman [[Chris Pronger]], and [[Vancouver Canucks]] winger [[Daniel Sedin]] have all used this tactic with success.\n\n==List of notable overtime games==\nThe [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Norwegian hockey|longest overtime game]] in history was an in Norwegian [[GET-ligaen]].

The goal comes at 16:30 of sextuple overtime for a total of 176:30 of game play. It is also the longest NHL ice hockey game ever played. The game is a mere 3:30 short of the equivalent of playing three games back-to-back-to-back.\n* February 4, 1939: The [[Boston Bruins]]' [[Mel Hill]] scores his third overtime goal of the Bruins' Stanley Cup semi-final series against the [[New York Rangers]], setting an unsurpassed (as of now) NHL record for most overtime goals in a single playoff series, earning him the nickname thereafter of \"Sudden Death\" Hill. The series itself involves four overtime games, two of which go to triple overtime.\n* April 23, 1950: [[Pete Babando]] scores at 8:31 of double overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 4\u20133 win in the seventh game of the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the New York Rangers. It is the first time that a seventh game of a Final series goes to overtime.\n* April 21, 1951: [[Bill Barilko]] scores at 2:53 of overtime to give the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] a 3\u20132 win in the fifth game of the [[1951 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. All five games in the series need to have overtime to be decided. Barilko was killed in a private plane crash in a remote part of northern Ontario a few months later.\n* April 16, 1954: [[Tony Leswick]]'s shot hit Montreal Canadiens' defenceman [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]]'s glove and went into the net at 4:20 of overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2\u20131 win in the seventh game of the [[1954 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the Canadiens. No seventh game of a Final series has gone to overtime since.\n* April 23, 1964: [[Bobby Baun]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] nets a game winner against Detroit 1:43 into overtime in game six of the Finals to tie the series 3\u2013all. The goal is notable because Baun broke his ankle earlier in the game. It was frozen and taped, and Baun returned to the ice to score the winning goal.\n* May 10, 1970: One of the most indelible moments in sports history is the sight of [[Bobby Orr]]'s \"in flight\" goal that gave the Boston Bruins a 4\u20133 win and a four-game sweep of the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the Stanley Cup Finals.\n* May 24, 1980: [[Bob Nystrom]] of the [[New York Islanders]] scores the Stanley Cup clinching goal at 7:11 of overtime, beating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games for the title.\n* April 14, 1981: After sitting on the bench for the entire game, [[Mike Crombeen]] scored the winning goal at 5:16 of double overtime to give the [[St. Louis Blues]] a 4\u20133 win over the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n* April 10, 1982: \"[[Miracle on Manchester]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rookie [[Daryl Evans]] gives the [[Los Angeles Kings]] a 6\u20135 win over the [[Edmonton Oilers]] at 2:35 of overtime. The Kings had trailed the Oilers 5\u20130 after the second period of game three of the Smythe Division Semi-final. This still remains the largest single game playoff comeback in NHL history.\n* May 5, 1986: [[Doug Wickenheiser]]'s overtime goal gives the St. Louis Blues a 6\u20135 win over the [[Calgary Flames]] in game six of the Campbell Conference Final. The goal, known as the \"Monday Night Miracle\", caps a 5\u20132 comeback and makes it more impressive that the three goals needed to tie the game were scored in the last ten minutes of the third period.\n* May 18, 1986: A [[Brian Skrudland]] goal ends the shortest overtime in NHL history at just nine seconds. The winning goal gives the Montreal Canadiens a 3\u20132 victory over the Calgary Flames in game two of the [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n* April 18, 1987: \"[[Easter Epic]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Pat LaFontaine]] of [[New York Islanders]] scores a goal against [[Washington Capitals]] at 8:47 of quadruple overtime which ends the longest game seven in NHL playoff history. Islanders goaltender [[Kelly Hrudey]] makes a record 73 saves.\n* May 15, 1990: After hardly playing in overtime, [[Petr Kl\u00edma|Petr Klima]] came off the bench late in triple overtime and scored almost immediately to end the longest overtime in NHL Finals history, with 4:47 left. The goal gave the Edmonton Oilers a 3\u20132 victory over the Boston Bruins to open the [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals]], setting the stage for the Oilers' fifth cup in seven years.\n* April 24, 1993: In game four of the Adams division semi-final between the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the Boston Bruins, Sabres forward [[Brad May]] scores in overtime to give Buffalo a 6\u20135 win and sweep the Bruins in the series, four games to none. Due to Buffalo commentator [[Rick Jeanneret]]'s colorful play call when May scored, this game has been referred to in Buffalo as \"May Day\".\n* April to June 1993: After losing in overtime of game one of the Adams division semi-final to the [[Quebec Nordiques]], the Montreal Canadiens go on to win ten consecutive overtime games en route to winning the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Habs score another overtime winner the following year against the Boston Bruins, making it eleven consecutive playoff overtime wins.\n* May 14, 1993: In game seven of the Patrick Division Finals, [[David Volek]] who spent most of the season as a healthy scratch, scored the series winning goal to give the [[New York Islanders]] a 4\u20133 victory ending the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] chances at a threepeat.\n* April 27, 1994: [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek]] of the Buffalo Sabres stops all 70 shots produced by the [[New Jersey Devils]] as [[Dave Hannan]] scores the lone goal over a sprawling [[Martin Brodeur]] at 5:43 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup. \n* April 30, 1994: [[Pavel Bure]] scores 2:20 into double overtime of the seventh game of the opening round of Vancouver's playoff series with Calgary. The win gives the [[Vancouver Canucks]] three consecutive overtime wins over the favored [[Calgary Flames]], who squander a 3\u20131 series lead.\n* May 27, 1994: [[St\u00e9phane Matteau]] scores the game-winning goal at 4:24 of double overtime with a wrap-around, beating [[Martin Brodeur]] and the New Jersey Devils in game seven, advancing the [[New York Rangers]] to the Stanley Cup Finals (where they would ultimately win it for the first time since 1940). It is Matteau's second goal in double overtime periods of the series.\n* April 24, 1996: [[Petr Nedv\u011bd|Petr Nedved]] scores with 44.6 seconds remaining in quadruple overtime to give the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] a 3\u20132 win over the [[Washington Capitals]] to tie their Eastern Conference quarter-final series at two games apiece.\n* June 6, 1996: [[Uwe Krupp]] became the 12th player in NHL history to end the Stanley Cup Finals in overtime, scoring a goal at 4:31 of triple overtime, giving the [[Colorado Avalanche]] a 1\u20130 win and a sweep of the [[Florida Panthers]].\n* June 19, 1999: [[Brett Hull]] scores with 5:09 left in triple overtime of game six to win the Stanley Cup for the [[Dallas Stars]] over the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. The goal is considered controversial by some fans due to disagreement on if the goal by Hull was legal or not. (see [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals]]).\n* May 5, 2000: [[Keith Primeau]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] put a shot over the left shoulder of [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] goaltender [[Ron Tugnutt]] with 7:59 left in quintuple overtime, ending the longest game since 1936.\n* June 6, 2000: [[Jason Arnott]] scores on Dallas Stars' goalie [[Ed Belfour]] in double overtime of game six to give the New Jersey Devils their second Stanley Cup.\n* April 12, 2007: [[Roberto Luongo]], goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks, wins his first career playoff game while making 72 saves, one shy of Kelly Hrudey's record. The game is the sixth longest ever, going into quadruple overtime. [[Henrik Sedin]] scores the winning goal in the Western Quarterfinals, beating the Dallas Stars 5\u20134 in game 1. The game is Vancouver's longest in history, and the Star's second longest, behind their five-overtime loss to Anaheim in 2003.\n* May 5, 2008: [[Brenden Morrow]] scores on [[San Jose Sharks]] goalie [[Evgeni Nabokov]] at 9:03 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Western Conference Semi-final between the Sharks and Stars. The game sees an incredible goaltending duel as Nabokov makes 53 saves in the loss while [[Marty Turco]] of Dallas makes 61 saves for the win.\n* June 6, 2008: In game five of the [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals]], the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]' [[Petr S\u00fdkora|Petr Sykora]] told [[Pierre Maguire]] of [[NBC]] that he would score the winning goal in overtime. At 9:57 of triple overtime, Sykora scored on Detroit Red Wings' goaltender [[Chris Osgood]] and sent the series back to Pittsburgh for game six. \n* June 6, 2010: [[Patrick Kane]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] shoots a goal past [[Philadelphia Flyers]] goalie [[Michael Leighton]] 4:10 into overtime of game six of the Stanley Cup Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4\u20133 win over the Flyers for their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1961.\n* April 26, 2011: [[Alexandre Burrows]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] scored at 5:22 of overtime past [[Corey Crawford]] of the Chicago Blackhawks to win the series 4\u20133 and the game 2\u20131, sending the Canucks to the Western Conference Semifinals, avoiding squandering a 3\u20130 series lead and a 1\u20130 lead in game seven in the third period.\n* June 6, 2011: Another Burrows goal ends the second-shortest overtime in NHL history at just eleven seconds. The winning goal gives the Vancouver Canucks a 3\u20132 victory over the Boston Bruins in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n* May 25, 2012: [[Adam Henrique]] of the New Jersey Devils scored at 1:03 into overtime past [[Henrik Lundqvist]] of the [[New York Rangers]] in game six of the Eastern Conference Final to send the Devils to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2003.\n* May 13, 2013: [[Patrice Bergeron]] of the Boston Bruins scored at 6:05 of overtime past [[James Reimer (ice hockey)|James Reimer]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the series 4\u20133 and the game 5\u20134, to send the Bruins to the Conference Semifinals to face the Rangers. It also capped a historic comeback in a game seven, coming back from a three-goal deficit in the third period. With fifty\u2013one seconds to go, they tied the game. The tying goal was also scored by Bergeron. The 2012\u201313 Boston Bruins became the first team in NHL history to do so in the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]].\n* June 6, 2013: [[Andrew Shaw (ice hockey)|Andrew Shaw]] scored with 7:52 left in triple overtime as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [[Boston Bruins]] 4\u20133 to open the Stanley Cup Finals, ending the fifth-longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history.\n* June 13, 2014: [[Alec Martinez]] took a rebound off a Tyler Toffoli shot blocked by Henrik Lundqvist and scored with 5:17 left in double overtime in game five of the [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals]], becoming the 16th player to win the Stanley Cup with an overtime goal as the [[Los Angeles Kings]] beat the New York Rangers 3\u20132, clinching the title 4\u20131 in the longest game in Kings history to that point (total game time 94:43). He became the first player to score two series-clinching playoff overtime goals in the same season since [[Martin Gelinas]] in 2004; on June 1, he scored 5:47 into overtime to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks 5\u20134 in game seven of the Western Conference Finals.\n* May 13, 2015: [[Derek Stepan]] scored with 8:36 left in the first overtime in game seven in the Eastern Conference Second Round against the [[Washington Capitals]] to send the [[New York Rangers]] to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Capitals also had a 3\u20131 series lead before losing the final three games and ultimately losing the series.\n* May 19, 2015: [[Marcus Kr\u00fcger|Marcus Kruger]] scored with 3:48 left in the third overtime in game two of the Western Conference Finals, as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [[Anaheim Ducks]], 3\u20132, tying the series at 1\u20131. This was Anaheim's first playoff loss at home that season and Chicago's longest overtime game to date. Chicago goalie [[Corey Crawford]] made 60 saves while defenceman [[Duncan Keith]] played seconds shy of 50 minutes on ice. Earlier in the second overtime period, Andrew Shaw used his head to direct the puck into the net, but the goal did not count.\n* April 24, 2016: [[John Tavares (ice hockey)|John Tavares]] scored the series-winner with 9:19 left in double overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference First Round as the New York Islanders won a playoff series for the first time since 1993, beating the Florida Panthers 2\u20131, to win the series 4\u20132.

The main methods of determining a winner in a tied game are the overtime period (commonly referred to as '''overtime'''), the [[Penalty shootout|shootout]], or a combination of both. If league rules dictate a finite time in which overtime may be played, with no penalty shoot-out to follow, the game's winning team may or may not be necessarily determined.\n\n==Overtime periods==\n[[File:American Hockey League ERI 5695 (5528600480).jpg|thumb|right|A scoreboard showing an overtime period. Since there are typically three periods in hockey, the fourth period is the overtime period.]]\n'''Overtime periods''' are extra [[Ice hockey#Periods and overtime|period]]s beyond the third regulation period during a game, where normal hockey rules apply. Although in the past, full-length overtime periods were played, overtimes today are ''[[golden goal]]'' (a form of ''[[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]''), meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a [[goal (ice hockey)|goal]].\n\n=== North American overtime ===\nFrom November 21, 1942,<ref>NHL Guide</ref> when overtime (an extra period of 10 minutes duration) was eliminated due to war time restrictions and continuing until the [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1983\u201384]] season, all [[National Hockey League|NHL]] regular-season games tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties. On June 23, 1983, the NHL introduced a regular-season overtime period of five minutes. If the five-minute overtime period ended with no scoring, the game ended as a tie. (The World Hockey Association had used a 10-minute, sudden death regular season overtime period during its seven-year existence.) In the first games to go to overtime, on October 5, 1983, the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to a 3\u20133 tie, and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6\u20136. The first regular-season game decided by overtime was on October 8, 1983, as the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8\u20137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/first454.html |title=World's first regular season NHL overtime game |publisher=Thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com |date= |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1987\u201388 AHL season|1987\u201388]] and since [[1995\u201396 AHL season|1995]], the [[American Hockey League]] has awarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss (OTL). In 1998, the AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five-minute overtime period with four skaters and a goaltender, rather than at full strength (five skaters), except in two-man advantage situations. In a two-man advantage situation, the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against three skaters. The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and [[ECHL]] the next season.\n\n[[Alexander Ovechkin|Alex Ovechkin]] has the record for most NHL overtime goals with 20.\n\nIn the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] and in all [[one-game playoff|tiebreaker games]], overtime periods are played like regulation periods except for the [[golden goal]] rule \u2013 in an overtime period, the game ends when one team scores a goal; the teams are at full strength (five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods. Four of the game's legendary players, [[Mark Messier]] (109 playoff goals), [[Mario Lemieux]] (77 goals), [[Gordie Howe]] (68 goals), and [[Alexander Ovechkin|Alex Ovechkin]] (65 goals) never scored a playoff overtime goal.\n\nIn many leagues (including the NHL for regular-season games since the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]]) and in international competitions, a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime may lead to a shootout. Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether and end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation. In the [[ECHL]], the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice (up to two additional players) for each penalty. If the penalised player returns to the ice, the game becomes 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 until the next stoppage of play, when it becomes 3-on-3. Prior to the [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315 season]], the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] set the overtime period at seven minutes,<ref name=dandc71014/> but reverted to the now-standard five-minute period the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theahl.com/board-of-governors-approves-changes-for-15-16|title=Board of Governors approves changes for 15\u201316|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}</ref> The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety of a five-minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the NHL on June 24, 2015, for use in the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=771982 |title=Board of Governors OKs 3-on-3 OT, coach's challenge |last1=Rosen |first1=Dan |date=June 24, 2015 |website=www.nhl.com |publisher=National Hockey League |access-date=June 25, 2015 |quote=}}</ref> The [[ECHL]] has changed the overtime to seven minutes for the 2019\u201320 season.\n\n=== International overtime ===\nIn [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] play, rules for overtime depend on the stage of the competition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew overtime procedures debuted at the [[2019 IIHF World Championship]] that will be in effect for all IIHF championships, including starting at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. All overtime periods will be 3-on-3 regardless of round robin or preliminary (five minutes with a three-round shootout), knockout rounds including third place games (ten minutes with a five-round shootout), or the championship (twenty minutes, no shootout).

Klein, \"Hockey Night in Europe: Goodbye, Columbus\", ''New York Times'', October 25, 2008.</ref><ref>V. Lychyk, \"English borrowings in recent Soviet Russian\", ''Papers and Studies in Contrastive Linguistics'' 29 (1994), p. 153.</ref>), are often used. Each coach selects three skaters from their team to take [[penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]s one at a time against the opposing [[goaltender]], with teams alternating shots. Each team gets one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before then (ex. a team gains a two-goal lead with only one round left). If the shootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a time (with each team taking one additional shot) until there is a winner.\n\nThe IIHF first adopted the game-winning-shot procedure in 1992 when a new playoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a winner for each game. At that time, the shootout was five rounds and only used for knock-out games. In 2006, it was reduced to three rounds and used for all games, eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events. Tie-breaker rounds are still used as needed, and the same or new players can take the tie-break shots, which is also done in reverse order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/home/format-rules.html |title=Format & Rules |publisher=Iihf.com |date= |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> As of May 2016, all IIHF preliminary round games that are not decided by overtime, are decided by a three-round shootout.

The standard five-man shootout is used after four-on-four overtime for all minor leagues in North America. The AHL switched to the NHL formatted three-man shootout for the 2014\u201315 season.<ref name=dandc71014>{{cite web|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/hockeyozone/2014/07/10/ot-in-ahl-now-7-minutes/12485519/|title=AHL extends OT to 7 minutes, adds 3-on-3 portion|website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Collegiate Hockey Association added the shootout as of the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nFollowing the lead of minor leagues, in the NHL's first post-lockout season of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], the league ends exhibition and regular season games still tied after a five-minute-length, three-skaters-per-side overtime period (as of the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]] onwards) with a shootout. The NHL format is a three-round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as needed. All skaters (except goalies) on a team's roster must shoot before any player can shoot a second time. On December 16, 2014 the longest shootout in NHL history went to 20 rounds before [[Nick Bjugstad]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] scored to defeat the [[Washington Capitals]]; the previous record was 15 rounds.<ref name=\"nhl\">{{cite news|title=Panthers outlast Capitals in longest NHL shootout when Nick Bjugstad scores in 20th round|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/panthers-outlast-capitals-in-longest-nhl-shootout-when-nick-bjugstad-scores-in-20th-round/c-744341|accessdate=January 15, 2017|publisher=NHL.com|date=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe shootout is not used in the playoffs for any North American league. Instead, full 20-minute overtime periods are played until [[golden goal|one team scores a goal]].\n\nIn the [[National Hockey League]] and [[American Hockey League]] All-Star Skills Competitions, the competition ends in a penalty shootout known as the ''Breakaway Relay''.\n\n===Tactics===\n[[File:American Hockey League ERI 5728 (5528017555).jpg|thumb|150px|right|A shootout between the [[Providence Bruins]] ([[Boston Bruins]] [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate) and [[Bridgeport Sound Tigers]] ([[New York Islanders]] [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate)]]\nTactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goalie. Both shooters and goalies commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player's style of play. Shooters often consider the goalie's strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick [[Save (ice hockey)|save]]), preferred goaltending style (such as [[Butterfly style|butterfly]] or [[stand-up style|stand-up]]) and method of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter's shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter.\n\nMost shooters attempt to [[deke (ice hockey)|out-deke]] the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance. Former [[Detroit Red Wings]] forward [[Pavel Datsyuk]] and [[New York Rangers]] forward [[Martin St. Louis]] are examples of players who commonly use this tactic. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as [[list of ice hockey terminology|sniping]]. This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening). Former NHL forwards [[Markus N\u00e4slund]] and [[Brett Hull]] are two players commonly referred to as [[list of ice hockey terminology|snipers]]. Very rarely a shooter may take a [[slapshot]] or [[wrist shot]] from the [[point (ice hockey)|point]] or top of the [[slot (ice hockey)|slot]]. This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise. Retired player [[Brian Rolston]], [[Detroit Red Wings]] winger [[Todd Bertuzzi]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]] defenseman [[Chris Pronger]], and [[Vancouver Canucks]] winger [[Daniel Sedin]] have all used this tactic with success.\n\n==List of notable overtime games==\nThe [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Norwegian hockey|longest overtime game]] in history was an in Norwegian [[GET-ligaen]].

The goal comes at 16:30 of sextuple overtime for a total of 176:30 of game play. It is also the longest NHL ice hockey game ever played. The game is a mere 3:30 short of the equivalent of playing three games back-to-back-to-back.\n* February 4, 1939: The [[Boston Bruins]]' [[Mel Hill]] scores his third overtime goal of the Bruins' Stanley Cup semi-final series against the [[New York Rangers]], setting an unsurpassed (as of now) NHL record for most overtime goals in a single playoff series, earning him the nickname thereafter of \"Sudden Death\" Hill. The series itself involves four overtime games, two of which go to triple overtime.\n* April 23, 1950: [[Pete Babando]] scores at 8:31 of double overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 4\u20133 win in the seventh game of the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the New York Rangers. It is the first time that a seventh game of a Final series goes to overtime.\n* April 21, 1951: [[Bill Barilko]] scores at 2:53 of overtime to give the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] a 3\u20132 win in the fifth game of the [[1951 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. All five games in the series need to have overtime to be decided. Barilko was killed in a private plane crash in a remote part of northern Ontario a few months later.\n* April 16, 1954: [[Tony Leswick]]'s shot hit Montreal Canadiens' defenceman [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]]'s glove and went into the net at 4:20 of overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2\u20131 win in the seventh game of the [[1954 Stanley Cup Finals]] over the Canadiens. No seventh game of a Final series has gone to overtime since.\n* April 23, 1964: [[Bobby Baun]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] nets a game winner against Detroit 1:43 into overtime in game six of the Finals to tie the series 3\u2013all. The goal is notable because Baun broke his ankle earlier in the game. It was frozen and taped, and Baun returned to the ice to score the winning goal.\n* May 10, 1970: One of the most indelible moments in sports history is the sight of [[Bobby Orr]]'s \"in flight\" goal that gave the Boston Bruins a 4\u20133 win and a four-game sweep of the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the Stanley Cup Finals.\n* May 24, 1980: [[Bob Nystrom]] of the [[New York Islanders]] scores the Stanley Cup clinching goal at 7:11 of overtime, beating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games for the title.\n* April 14, 1981: After sitting on the bench for the entire game, [[Mike Crombeen]] scored the winning goal at 5:16 of double overtime to give the [[St. Louis Blues]] a 4\u20133 win over the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n* April 10, 1982: \"[[Miracle on Manchester]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rookie [[Daryl Evans]] gives the [[Los Angeles Kings]] a 6\u20135 win over the [[Edmonton Oilers]] at 2:35 of overtime. The Kings had trailed the Oilers 5\u20130 after the second period of game three of the Smythe Division Semi-final. This still remains the largest single game playoff comeback in NHL history.\n* May 5, 1986: [[Doug Wickenheiser]]'s overtime goal gives the St. Louis Blues a 6\u20135 win over the [[Calgary Flames]] in game six of the Campbell Conference Final. The goal, known as the \"Monday Night Miracle\", caps a 5\u20132 comeback and makes it more impressive that the three goals needed to tie the game were scored in the last ten minutes of the third period.\n* May 18, 1986: A [[Brian Skrudland]] goal ends the shortest overtime in NHL history at just nine seconds. The winning goal gives the Montreal Canadiens a 3\u20132 victory over the Calgary Flames in game two of the [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n* April 18, 1987: \"[[Easter Epic]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Pat LaFontaine]] of [[New York Islanders]] scores a goal against [[Washington Capitals]] at 8:47 of quadruple overtime which ends the longest game seven in NHL playoff history. Islanders goaltender [[Kelly Hrudey]] makes a record 73 saves.\n* May 15, 1990: After hardly playing in overtime, [[Petr Kl\u00edma|Petr Klima]] came off the bench late in triple overtime and scored almost immediately to end the longest overtime in NHL Finals history, with 4:47 left. The goal gave the Edmonton Oilers a 3\u20132 victory over the Boston Bruins to open the [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals]], setting the stage for the Oilers' fifth cup in seven years.\n* April 24, 1993: In game four of the Adams division semi-final between the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the Boston Bruins, Sabres forward [[Brad May]] scores in overtime to give Buffalo a 6\u20135 win and sweep the Bruins in the series, four games to none. Due to Buffalo commentator [[Rick Jeanneret]]'s colorful play call when May scored, this game has been referred to in Buffalo as \"May Day\".\n* April to June 1993: After losing in overtime of game one of the Adams division semi-final to the [[Quebec Nordiques]], the Montreal Canadiens go on to win ten consecutive overtime games en route to winning the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Habs score another overtime winner the following year against the Boston Bruins, making it eleven consecutive playoff overtime wins.\n* May 14, 1993: In game seven of the Patrick Division Finals, [[David Volek]] who spent most of the season as a healthy scratch, scored the series winning goal to give the [[New York Islanders]] a 4\u20133 victory ending the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] chances at a threepeat.\n* April 27, 1994: [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek]] of the Buffalo Sabres stops all 70 shots produced by the [[New Jersey Devils]] as [[Dave Hannan]] scores the lone goal over a sprawling [[Martin Brodeur]] at 5:43 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup. \n* April 30, 1994: [[Pavel Bure]] scores 2:20 into double overtime of the seventh game of the opening round of Vancouver's playoff series with Calgary. The win gives the [[Vancouver Canucks]] three consecutive overtime wins over the favored [[Calgary Flames]], who squander a 3\u20131 series lead.\n* May 27, 1994: [[St\u00e9phane Matteau]] scores the game-winning goal at 4:24 of double overtime with a wrap-around, beating [[Martin Brodeur]] and the New Jersey Devils in game seven, advancing the [[New York Rangers]] to the Stanley Cup Finals (where they would ultimately win it for the first time since 1940). It is Matteau's second goal in double overtime periods of the series.\n* April 24, 1996: [[Petr Nedv\u011bd|Petr Nedved]] scores with 44.6 seconds remaining in quadruple overtime to give the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] a 3\u20132 win over the [[Washington Capitals]] to tie their Eastern Conference quarter-final series at two games apiece.\n* June 6, 1996: [[Uwe Krupp]] became the 12th player in NHL history to end the Stanley Cup Finals in overtime, scoring a goal at 4:31 of triple overtime, giving the [[Colorado Avalanche]] a 1\u20130 win and a sweep of the [[Florida Panthers]].\n* June 19, 1999: [[Brett Hull]] scores with 5:09 left in triple overtime of game six to win the Stanley Cup for the [[Dallas Stars]] over the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. The goal is considered controversial by some fans due to disagreement on if the goal by Hull was legal or not. (see [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals]]).\n* May 5, 2000: [[Keith Primeau]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] put a shot over the left shoulder of [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] goaltender [[Ron Tugnutt]] with 7:59 left in quintuple overtime, ending the longest game since 1936.\n* June 6, 2000: [[Jason Arnott]] scores on Dallas Stars' goalie [[Ed Belfour]] in double overtime of game six to give the New Jersey Devils their second Stanley Cup.\n* April 12, 2007: [[Roberto Luongo]], goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks, wins his first career playoff game while making 72 saves, one shy of Kelly Hrudey's record. The game is the sixth longest ever, going into quadruple overtime. [[Henrik Sedin]] scores the winning goal in the Western Quarterfinals, beating the Dallas Stars 5\u20134 in game 1. The game is Vancouver's longest in history, and the Star's second longest, behind their five-overtime loss to Anaheim in 2003.\n* May 5, 2008: [[Brenden Morrow]] scores on [[San Jose Sharks]] goalie [[Evgeni Nabokov]] at 9:03 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Western Conference Semi-final between the Sharks and Stars. The game sees an incredible goaltending duel as Nabokov makes 53 saves in the loss while [[Marty Turco]] of Dallas makes 61 saves for the win.\n* June 6, 2008: In game five of the [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals]], the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]' [[Petr S\u00fdkora|Petr Sykora]] told [[Pierre Maguire]] of [[NBC]] that he would score the winning goal in overtime. At 9:57 of triple overtime, Sykora scored on Detroit Red Wings' goaltender [[Chris Osgood]] and sent the series back to Pittsburgh for game six. \n* June 6, 2010: [[Patrick Kane]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] shoots a goal past [[Philadelphia Flyers]] goalie [[Michael Leighton]] 4:10 into overtime of game six of the Stanley Cup Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4\u20133 win over the Flyers for their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1961.\n* April 26, 2011: [[Alexandre Burrows]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] scored at 5:22 of overtime past [[Corey Crawford]] of the Chicago Blackhawks to win the series 4\u20133 and the game 2\u20131, sending the Canucks to the Western Conference Semifinals, avoiding squandering a 3\u20130 series lead and a 1\u20130 lead in game seven in the third period.\n* June 6, 2011: Another Burrows goal ends the second-shortest overtime in NHL history at just eleven seconds. The winning goal gives the Vancouver Canucks a 3\u20132 victory over the Boston Bruins in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n* May 25, 2012: [[Adam Henrique]] of the New Jersey Devils scored at 1:03 into overtime past [[Henrik Lundqvist]] of the [[New York Rangers]] in game six of the Eastern Conference Final to send the Devils to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2003.\n* May 13, 2013: [[Patrice Bergeron]] of the Boston Bruins scored at 6:05 of overtime past [[James Reimer (ice hockey)|James Reimer]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the series 4\u20133 and the game 5\u20134, to send the Bruins to the Conference Semifinals to face the Rangers. It also capped a historic comeback in a game seven, coming back from a three-goal deficit in the third period. With fifty\u2013one seconds to go, they tied the game. The tying goal was also scored by Bergeron. The 2012\u201313 Boston Bruins became the first team in NHL history to do so in the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]].\n* June 6, 2013: [[Andrew Shaw (ice hockey)|Andrew Shaw]] scored with 7:52 left in triple overtime as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [[Boston Bruins]] 4\u20133 to open the Stanley Cup Finals, ending the fifth-longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history.\n* June 13, 2014: [[Alec Martinez]] took a rebound off a Tyler Toffoli shot blocked by Henrik Lundqvist and scored with 5:17 left in double overtime in game five of the [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals]], becoming the 16th player to win the Stanley Cup with an overtime goal as the [[Los Angeles Kings]] beat the New York Rangers 3\u20132, clinching the title 4\u20131 in the longest game in Kings history to that point (total game time 94:43). He became the first player to score two series-clinching playoff overtime goals in the same season since [[Martin Gelinas]] in 2004; on June 1, he scored 5:47 into overtime to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks 5\u20134 in game seven of the Western Conference Finals.\n* May 13, 2015: [[Derek Stepan]] scored with 8:36 left in the first overtime in game seven in the Eastern Conference Second Round against the [[Washington Capitals]] to send the [[New York Rangers]] to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Capitals also had a 3\u20131 series lead before losing the final three games and ultimately losing the series.\n* May 19, 2015: [[Marcus Kr\u00fcger|Marcus Kruger]] scored with 3:48 left in the third overtime in game two of the Western Conference Finals, as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [[Anaheim Ducks]], 3\u20132, tying the series at 1\u20131. This was Anaheim's first playoff loss at home that season and Chicago's longest overtime game to date. Chicago goalie [[Corey Crawford]] made 60 saves while defenceman [[Duncan Keith]] played seconds shy of 50 minutes on ice. Earlier in the second overtime period, Andrew Shaw used his head to direct the puck into the net, but the goal did not count.\n* April 24, 2016: [[John Tavares (ice hockey)|John Tavares]] scored the series-winner with 9:19 left in double overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference First Round as the New York Islanders won a playoff series for the first time since 1993, beating the Florida Panthers 2\u20131, to win the series 4\u20132.

Morocco was readmitted in the African Union on 30 January 2017 by ensuring that the conflicting claims between Morocco and the SADR would be solved peacefully and stopping the extension of its exclusive military control by building additional walls. The African Union however has not issued any formal statement about the border separating the sovereign territories of Morocco and the SADR in Western Sahara, until their conflict is resolved. Instead, the African Union participates with the United Nations mission, in order to maintain a ceasefire and reach a peace agreement between its two members. The African Union provides peacekeepers to the UN peacekeeping mission, in order to control a buffer zone near the ''de facto'' border of walls built by Morocco, and this area still remains a no-man's-land only without permanent residents except temporary controls by UN military peacekeepers and some incursions of the Moroccan army.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Western Sahara}}\nWestern Sahara is located on the northwest coast in [[West Africa]] and on the cusp of [[North Africa]], bordering the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the northwest, [[Morocco|Morocco proper]] to [[Morocco\u2013Western Sahara border|the north-northeast]], [[Algeria]] to [[Algeria\u2013Western Sahara border|the east-northeast]], and [[Mauritania]] to [[Mauritania\u2013Western Sahara border|the east and south]].\n\nAmong the most arid and inhospitable on the planet, the land along the coast is low flat desert and rises, especially in the north, to small mountains reaching up to {{Convert|600|m}} on the eastern side.\n\nWhile the area can experience flash flooding in the spring, there are no permanent streams. At times, a cool off-shore current can produce fog and heavy dew.\n\nThe interior experiences extreme summer heat, with average highs reaching {{Convert|43|-|45|C|F}} in July and in August; during winter, days are still hot to very hot, with average highs from {{Convert|25|to|30|C|F}}; however, in the northern part of the territory, the thermometer may drop below {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|0}} at night and it can be freezing in December and in January, although this is rare.\n\n<gallery class=\"left\">\nWestern Sahara (orthographic projection).svg|Western Sahara in Africa.\nWestern Sahara Topography.png|Topography of Western Sahara.\n</gallery>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Western Sahara}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Further|Timeline of Serer history|Serer history}}\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Western Sahara were the [[Gaetuli]].

Spanish decolonization proceeded more slowly, but internal political and social pressures for it in mainland Spain built up towards the end of [[Francisco Franco]]'s rule. There was a global trend towards complete [[decolonization]]. Spain began rapidly to divest itself of most of its remaining colonial possessions. By 1974\u201375 the government issued promises of a referendum on independence in Western Sahara.\n\nAt the same time, Morocco and Mauritania, which had historical and competing claims of sovereignty over the territory, argued that it had been artificially separated from their territories by the European colonial powers. Algeria, which also bordered the territory, viewed their demands with suspicion, as Morocco also claimed the Algerian provinces of [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]] and [[B\u00e9char Province|B\u00e9char]]. After arguing for a process of decolonization to be guided by the United Nations, the Algerian government under [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] in 1975 committed to assisting the Polisario Front, which opposed both Moroccan and Mauritanian claims and demanded full independence of Western Sahara.\n\nThe UN attempted to settle these disputes through a [[UN visiting mission to Spanish Sahara|visiting mission]] in late 1975, as well as a [[International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara|verdict]] from the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). It acknowledged that Western Sahara had historical links with Morocco and Mauritania, but not sufficient to prove the sovereignty of either State over the territory at the time of the Spanish colonization. The population of the territory thus possessed the right of [[self-determination]]. On 6 November 1975 Morocco initiated the [[Green March]] into Western Sahara; 350,000 unarmed Moroccans converged on the city of [[Tarfaya]] in southern Morocco and waited for a signal from King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] to cross the border in a peaceful march. A few days before, on 31 October, Moroccan troops invaded Western Sahara from the north.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=J\u00e1nos|first1=Beseny\u0151|title=Western Sahara|date=2009|publisher=Publikon Publishers|location=P\u00e9cs|isbn=978-963-88332-0-4|url=http://www.kalasnyikov.hu/dokumentumok/besenyo_western_sahara.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Demands for independence ===\n[[File:Western sahara walls moroccan map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|System of the [[Moroccan Wall]]s in Western Sahara set up in the 1980s]]\n[[File:RASD - Commemoration of the 30th independence day in the Liberated Territories (2006).jpg|thumb|Commemoration of the 30th independence day from [[Spain]] in the [[Free Zone (Western Sahara)|Liberated Territories]] (2005)]]\nIn the waning days of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rule, and after the [[Green March]], the Spanish government signed a [[Madrid Accords|tripartite agreement]] with Morocco and Mauritania as it moved to transfer the territory on 14 November 1975.

In 1997, the [[Houston Agreement]] attempted to revive the proposal for a referendum but likewise has hitherto not had success. {{As of|2010}}, negotiations over terms have not resulted in any substantive action. At the heart of the dispute lies the question of who qualifies to be registered to participate in the referendum, and, since about the year 2000, Morocco considers that since there is no agreement on persons entitled to vote, a referendum is not possible. Meanwhile, Polisario still insisted on a referendum with independence as a clear option, without offering a solution to the problem of who is qualified to be registered to participate in it.\n\nBoth sides blame each other for the stalling of the referendum. The Polisario has insisted on only allowing those found on the 1974 Spanish Census lists (see below) to vote, while Morocco has insisted that the census was flawed by evasion and sought the inclusion of members of Sahrawi tribes which escaped from Spanish invasion to the north of Morocco by the 19th century.\n\nEfforts by the UN special envoys to find a common ground for both parties did not succeed. By 1999 the UN had identified about 85,000 voters, with nearly half of them in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara or Southern Morocco, and the others scattered between the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Tindouf refugee camps]], Mauritania and other places of exile. Polisario accepted this voter list, as it had done with the previous list presented by the UN (both of them originally based on the Spanish census of 1974), but Morocco refused and, as rejected voter candidates began a mass-appeals procedure, insisted that each application be scrutinized individually. This again brought the process to a halt.\n\nAccording to a NATO delegation, MINURSO election observers stated in 1999, as the deadlock continued, that \"if the number of voters does not rise significantly the odds were slightly on the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]] side\".<ref>{{Cite web |author=iBi Center |url=http://www.nato-pa.int/archivedpub/trip/as79gsm993-morocco.asp |title=NATO PA&nbsp;\u2013 Archives |publisher=Nato-pa.int |access-date=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052936/http://www.nato-pa.int/archivedpub/trip/as79gsm993-morocco.asp |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> By 2001, the process had effectively stalemated and the UN Secretary-General asked the parties for the first time to explore other, third-way solutions. Indeed, shortly after the Houston Agreement (1997), Morocco officially declared that it was \"no longer necessary\" to include an option of independence on the ballot, offering instead autonomy. Erik Jensen, who played an administrative role in MINURSO, wrote that neither side would agree to a voter registration in which they were destined to lose (see ''[[#Bibliography|Western Sahara: Anatomy of a Stalemate]]'').\n\n=== Baker Plan ===\n{{Main|Baker Plan}}\nAs personal envoy of the Secretary-General, [[James Baker]] visited all sides and produced the document known as the \"Baker Plan\".<ref name=\"UN_S2000461\">{{UN document |docid=S-2000-461 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2000 |access-date=10 August 2007| date=22 May 2000}}</ref> This was discussed by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 2000, and envisioned an autonomous [[Western Sahara Authority]] (WSA), which would be followed after five years by the referendum. Every person present in the territory would be allowed to vote, regardless of birthplace and with no regard to the Spanish census. It was rejected by both sides, although it was initially derived from a Moroccan proposal. According to Baker's draft, tens of thousands of post-annexation immigrants from Morocco proper (viewed by Polisario as settlers but by Morocco as legitimate inhabitants of the area) would be granted the vote in the Sahrawi independence referendum, and the ballot would be split three ways by the inclusion of an unspecified \"[[Autonomous administrative division|autonomy]]\", further undermining the independence camp. Morocco was also allowed to keep its army in the area and retain control over all security issues during both the autonomy years and the election. In 2002, the Moroccan king stated that the referendum idea was \"out of date\" since it \"cannot be implemented\";<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&topic=SEWSA |title=CountryWatch&nbsp;\u2013 Interesting Facts Of The World |publisher=Countrywatch.com |access-date=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005160618/http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&topic=SEWSA |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Polisario retorted that that was only because of the King's refusal to allow it to take place.\n\nIn 2003, a new version of the plan was made official, with some additions spelling out the powers of the WSA, making it less reliant on Moroccan [[devolution]]. It also provided further detail on the referendum process in order to make it harder to stall or subvert. This second draft, commonly known as Baker II, was accepted by the Polisario as a \"basis of negotiations\" to the surprise of many.<ref>Shelley, Toby. ''[http://www.merip.org/mero/mero080103.html Behind the Baker Plan for Western Sahara] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210082330/http://www.merip.org/mero/mero080103.html |date=10 December 2006}}'', Middle East Report Online, 1 August 2003. Retrieved 24 August 2006.</ref> This appeared to abandon Polisario's previous position of only negotiating based on the standards of voter identification from 1991 (i.e. the Spanish census). After that, the draft quickly garnered widespread international support, culminating in the UN Security Council's unanimous endorsement of the plan in the summer of 2003.\n\n=== End of the 2000s ===\n{{Update|the [[Manhasset negotiations]] (not in article)|date=September 2013}}\nBaker resigned his post at the United Nations in 2004; his term did not see the crisis resolved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200406141270.html|title=Western Sahara: Baker Resigns As UN Mediator After Seven Years|date=14 June 2004|access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref> His resignation followed several months of failed attempts to get Morocco to enter into formal negotiations on the plan, but he met with rejection. The new king, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]], opposes any referendum on independence, and has said Morocco will never agree to one: \"We shall not give up one inch of our beloved Sahara, not a grain of its sand.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/04apr06/insight/ins4.html|title=Times News \u2013 Bold, Authoritative, and True|website=Times News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605000502/http://www.timesnews.co.ke/04apr06/insight/ins4.html|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInstead, he proposes, through an appointed advisory body [[Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs]] (CORCAS), a self-governing Western Sahara as an autonomous community within Morocco. His father, [[Hassan II of Morocco]], initially supported the referendum idea in principle in 1982, and signed contracts with Polisario and the UN in 1991 and 1997. No major powers have expressed interest in forcing the issue, however, and Morocco has shown little interest in a real referendum.\n\nThe UN has put forth no replacement strategy after the breakdown of Baker II, and renewed fighting has been raised as a possibility. In 2005, former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] reported increased military activity on both sides of the front and breaches of several cease-fire provisions against strengthening military fortifications.\n\nMorocco has repeatedly tried to get Algeria into bilateral negotiations, based on its view of Polisario as the [[The Monkey and the Cat|cat's paw]] of the Algerian military. It has received vocal support from France and occasionally (and currently) from the United States. These negotiations would define the exact limits of a Western Sahara autonomy under Moroccan rule but only after Morocco's \"inalienable right\" to the territory was recognized as a precondition to the talks. The Algerian government has consistently refused, claiming it has neither the will nor the right to negotiate on the behalf of the Polisario Front.\n\nDemonstrations and riots by supporters of independence or a referendum broke out in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara in May 2005 and in parts of southern Morocco (notably the town of [[Assa (Morocco)|Assa]]). They were met by police. Several international human rights organizations expressed concern at what they termed abuse by Moroccan security forces, and a number of Sahrawi activists have been jailed. Pro-independence Sahrawi sources, including the Polisario, have given these demonstrations the name \"[[Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)|Independence Intifada]]\", while most sources have tended to see the events as being of limited importance. International press and other media coverage have been sparse, and reporting is complicated by the Moroccan government's policy of strictly controlling independent media coverage within the territory.\n\n[[File:Manifestation in Madrid for the independence of the Western Sahara (11).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A demonstration in Madrid for the independence of Western Sahara.]]\nDemonstrations and protests still occur, even after Morocco declared in February 2006 that it was contemplating a plan for devolving a limited variant of autonomy to the territory but still explicitly refused any referendum on independence. As of January 2007, the plan had not been made public, though the Moroccan government claimed that it was more or less complete.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/18964 |title=afrol News&nbsp;\u2013 No plans for a referendum in Western Sahara |publisher=Afrol.com |access-date=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nPolisario has intermittently threatened to resume fighting, referring to the Moroccan refusal of a referendum as a breach of the [[Settlement Plan|cease-fire terms]], but most observers seem to consider armed conflict unlikely without the green light from [[Algeria]], which houses the Sahrawis' refugee camps and has been the main military sponsor of the movement.\n\nIn April 2007, the government of Morocco suggested that a self-governing entity, through the [[Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs]] (CORCAS), should govern the territory with some degree of autonomy for Western Sahara. The project was presented to the UN Security Council in mid-April 2007. The stalemating of the Moroccan proposal options has led the UN in the recent \"Report of the UN Secretary-General\" to ask the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/299/28/PDF/N0729928.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western Sahara (13 April 2007)(ped).

They are [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniya]]-speaking or [[Berber language|Berber]]-speaking tribes of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin ([[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)#E-M183|97% of Y-DNA]]). Many of them have mixed [[Arab-Berber|Berber-Arab]] heritage, effectively continuations of the tribal groupings of Hassaniya-speaking and Zenaga-Berber speaking [[Moors|Moorish]] tribes extending south into Mauritania and north into Morocco as well as east into Algeria. The Sahrawis are traditionally nomadic Bedouins with a lifestyle very similar to that of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg Berbers]] from whom Sahrawis most likely have descended, and they can be found in all surrounding countries. War and conflict has led to major population displacement.\n\nAs of July 2004, an estimated 267,405 people (excluding about 160,000 Moroccan military personnel) lived in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara. Many people from parts of Morocco have come to live in the territory, and these latest arrivals are today thought to outnumber the indigenous Western Sahara Sahrawis. The precise size and composition of the population is subject to political controversy.\n\nThe Polisario-controlled parts of Western Sahara are barren. This area has a very small population, estimated to be approximately 30,000 in 2008.<ref name=\"nrc.no\" /> The population is primarily made up of nomads who engage in herding camels back and forth between the [[Tindouf]] area and Mauritania. However, the presence of land mines scattered throughout the territory by the Moroccan army makes it a dangerous way of life.\n\n=== Spanish census and MINURSO ===\nA 1974 Spanish census claimed there were some 74,000 Sahrawis in the area at the time (in addition to approximately 20,000 Spanish residents), but this number is likely to be on the low side, due to the difficulty in counting a nomad people, even if Sahrawis were by the mid-1970s mostly urbanized. Despite these possible inaccuracies, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on using the Spanish census as the basis for voter registration when striking a [[cease-fire]] agreement in the late 1980s, contingent on the holding of a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco.\n\nIn December 1999, the United Nations' [[MINURSO]] mission announced that it had identified 86,425 eligible voters for the referendum that was supposed to be held under the 1991 [[Settlement plan]] and the 1997 [[Houston accords]]. By \"eligible voter\" the UN referred to any Sahrawi over 18 years of age that was part of the Spanish census or could prove their descent from someone who was. These 86,425 Sahrawis were dispersed between Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and the refugee camps in Algeria, with smaller numbers in Mauritania and other places of exile. These numbers cover only Sahrawis 'indigenous' to Western Sahara during the Spanish colonial period, not the total number of \"ethnic\" Sahrawis (i.e., members of Sahrawi tribal groupings), who also extend into Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. The number was highly politically significant due to the expected organization of a referendum on self-determination.\n\nThe Polisario has its home base in the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Tindouf refugee camps]] in Algeria, and declares the number of Sahrawi population in the camps to be approximately 155,000. Morocco disputes this number, saying it is exaggerated for political reasons and for attracting more foreign aid. The UN uses a number of 90,000 \"most vulnerable\" refugees as basis for its food aid program.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Western Sahara}}\n{{See also|Western Saharan cuisine}}\n[[File:Museo de la Guerra en Rabuni, sede del gobierno de la RASD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[People's Liberation Army Museum|Museum of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army]].]]\nThe major ethnic group of Western Sahara are the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]], a nomadic or [[Bedouin]] ethnic group speaking the [[Hassaniya|Hass\u0101n\u012bya]] dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], also spoken in much of Mauritania. They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but claim descent from the [[Beni Hassan]], an Arab tribe that migrated across the desert in the 11th century.\n\nPhysically indistinguishable from the Hassaniya speaking [[Moors]] of Mauritania, the Sahrawi people differ from their neighbours partly because of different tribal affiliations (as tribal confederations cut across present modern boundaries) and partly as a consequence of their exposure to Spanish colonial domination. Surrounding territories were generally under French colonial rule.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=November 2013}}\n\nLike other Saharan Bedouin and Hassaniya groups, the Sahrawis are mostly Muslims of the [[Sunni]] branch and the [[Maliki]] [[fiqh]]. Local religious custom ([[Urf]]) is, like other Saharan groups, heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Berber and African practices, and differs substantially from urban practices. For example, Sahrawi Islam has traditionally functioned without mosques, in an adaptation to nomadic life.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe original [[clan]]-/tribe-based society underwent a massive social upheaval in 1975 when the war forced part of the population to settle in the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|refugee camps of Tindouf]], Algeria, where they remain. Families were broken up by the dispute.\n\nThe [[People's Liberation Army Museum|Museum of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army]] is located in this refugee camp.

At times, a cool off-shore current can produce fog and heavy dew.\n\nThe interior experiences extreme summer heat, with average highs reaching {{Convert|43|-|45|C|F}} in July and in August; during winter, days are still hot to very hot, with average highs from {{Convert|25|to|30|C|F}}; however, in the northern part of the territory, the thermometer may drop below {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|0}} at night and it can be freezing in December and in January, although this is rare.\n\n<gallery class=\"left\">\nWestern Sahara (orthographic projection).svg|Western Sahara in Africa.\nWestern Sahara Topography.png|Topography of Western Sahara.\n</gallery>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Western Sahara}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Further|Timeline of Serer history|Serer history}}\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Western Sahara were the [[Gaetuli]].

The Bafour were later replaced or absorbed by [[Berber languages|Berber-speaking]] populations, which eventually merged in turn with the migrating [[Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n]] Arab tribes.\n\nThe arrival of Islam in the 8th century played a major role in the development of the [[Maghreb]] region. Trade developed further, and the territory may have been one of the routes for [[Camel train|caravans]], especially between [[Marrakesh]] and [[Tombouctou Region|Tombouctou]] in Mali.\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Maqil]] Arabs (fewer than 200 individuals) settled in [[Morocco]] (mainly in the [[Draa River]] valley, between the [[Moulouya River]], [[Tafilalt]] and [[Taourirt, Morocco|Taourirt]]).<ref name=khaldun>History of Ibn Khaldun Volume 6, pp80-90 by [[ibn Khaldun]]</ref> Towards the end of the [[Almohad Caliphate]], the Beni Hassan, a sub-tribe of the Maqil, were called by the local ruler of the [[Sous]] to quell a rebellion; they settled in the Sous [[Ksar|Ksours]] and controlled such cities as [[Taroudant]].<ref name=khaldun /> During [[Marinid dynasty]] rule, the Beni Hassan rebelled but were defeated by the Sultan and escaped beyond the Saguia el-Hamra dry river.<ref name=khaldun /><ref>''[[Rawd al-Qirtas]]'', [[Ibn Abi Zar]]</ref> The Beni Hassan then were at constant war with the [[Lamtuna]] nomadic Berbers of the [[Sahara]].

As a consequence, [[Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri]], the Chief of Cabinet, General Secretary of the Government of Spanish Morocco, cooperated with the Spanish to select governors in that area.

Spanish decolonization proceeded more slowly, but internal political and social pressures for it in mainland Spain built up towards the end of [[Francisco Franco]]'s rule. There was a global trend towards complete [[decolonization]]. Spain began rapidly to divest itself of most of its remaining colonial possessions. By 1974\u201375 the government issued promises of a referendum on independence in Western Sahara.\n\nAt the same time, Morocco and Mauritania, which had historical and competing claims of sovereignty over the territory, argued that it had been artificially separated from their territories by the European colonial powers. Algeria, which also bordered the territory, viewed their demands with suspicion, as Morocco also claimed the Algerian provinces of [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]] and [[B\u00e9char Province|B\u00e9char]]. After arguing for a process of decolonization to be guided by the United Nations, the Algerian government under [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] in 1975 committed to assisting the Polisario Front, which opposed both Moroccan and Mauritanian claims and demanded full independence of Western Sahara.\n\nThe UN attempted to settle these disputes through a [[UN visiting mission to Spanish Sahara|visiting mission]] in late 1975, as well as a [[International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara|verdict]] from the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). It acknowledged that Western Sahara had historical links with Morocco and Mauritania, but not sufficient to prove the sovereignty of either State over the territory at the time of the Spanish colonization. The population of the territory thus possessed the right of [[self-determination]]. On 6 November 1975 Morocco initiated the [[Green March]] into Western Sahara; 350,000 unarmed Moroccans converged on the city of [[Tarfaya]] in southern Morocco and waited for a signal from King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] to cross the border in a peaceful march. A few days before, on 31 October, Moroccan troops invaded Western Sahara from the north.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=J\u00e1nos|first1=Beseny\u0151|title=Western Sahara|date=2009|publisher=Publikon Publishers|location=P\u00e9cs|isbn=978-963-88332-0-4|url=http://www.kalasnyikov.hu/dokumentumok/besenyo_western_sahara.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Demands for independence ===\n[[File:Western sahara walls moroccan map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|System of the [[Moroccan Wall]]s in Western Sahara set up in the 1980s]]\n[[File:RASD - Commemoration of the 30th independence day in the Liberated Territories (2006).jpg|thumb|Commemoration of the 30th independence day from [[Spain]] in the [[Free Zone (Western Sahara)|Liberated Territories]] (2005)]]\nIn the waning days of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rule, and after the [[Green March]], the Spanish government signed a [[Madrid Accords|tripartite agreement]] with Morocco and Mauritania as it moved to transfer the territory on 14 November 1975.

In 1997, the [[Houston Agreement]] attempted to revive the proposal for a referendum but likewise has hitherto not had success. {{As of|2010}}, negotiations over terms have not resulted in any substantive action. At the heart of the dispute lies the question of who qualifies to be registered to participate in the referendum, and, since about the year 2000, Morocco considers that since there is no agreement on persons entitled to vote, a referendum is not possible. Meanwhile, Polisario still insisted on a referendum with independence as a clear option, without offering a solution to the problem of who is qualified to be registered to participate in it.\n\nBoth sides blame each other for the stalling of the referendum. The Polisario has insisted on only allowing those found on the 1974 Spanish Census lists (see below) to vote, while Morocco has insisted that the census was flawed by evasion and sought the inclusion of members of Sahrawi tribes which escaped from Spanish invasion to the north of Morocco by the 19th century.\n\nEfforts by the UN special envoys to find a common ground for both parties did not succeed. By 1999 the UN had identified about 85,000 voters, with nearly half of them in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara or Southern Morocco, and the others scattered between the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Tindouf refugee camps]], Mauritania and other places of exile. Polisario accepted this voter list, as it had done with the previous list presented by the UN (both of them originally based on the Spanish census of 1974), but Morocco refused and, as rejected voter candidates began a mass-appeals procedure, insisted that each application be scrutinized individually. This again brought the process to a halt.\n\nAccording to a NATO delegation, MINURSO election observers stated in 1999, as the deadlock continued, that \"if the number of voters does not rise significantly the odds were slightly on the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]] side\".<ref>{{Cite web |author=iBi Center |url=http://www.nato-pa.int/archivedpub/trip/as79gsm993-morocco.asp |title=NATO PA&nbsp;\u2013 Archives |publisher=Nato-pa.int |access-date=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052936/http://www.nato-pa.int/archivedpub/trip/as79gsm993-morocco.asp |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> By 2001, the process had effectively stalemated and the UN Secretary-General asked the parties for the first time to explore other, third-way solutions. Indeed, shortly after the Houston Agreement (1997), Morocco officially declared that it was \"no longer necessary\" to include an option of independence on the ballot, offering instead autonomy. Erik Jensen, who played an administrative role in MINURSO, wrote that neither side would agree to a voter registration in which they were destined to lose (see ''[[#Bibliography|Western Sahara: Anatomy of a Stalemate]]'').\n\n=== Baker Plan ===\n{{Main|Baker Plan}}\nAs personal envoy of the Secretary-General, [[James Baker]] visited all sides and produced the document known as the \"Baker Plan\".<ref name=\"UN_S2000461\">{{UN document |docid=S-2000-461 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2000 |access-date=10 August 2007| date=22 May 2000}}</ref> This was discussed by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 2000, and envisioned an autonomous [[Western Sahara Authority]] (WSA), which would be followed after five years by the referendum. Every person present in the territory would be allowed to vote, regardless of birthplace and with no regard to the Spanish census. It was rejected by both sides, although it was initially derived from a Moroccan proposal. According to Baker's draft, tens of thousands of post-annexation immigrants from Morocco proper (viewed by Polisario as settlers but by Morocco as legitimate inhabitants of the area) would be granted the vote in the Sahrawi independence referendum, and the ballot would be split three ways by the inclusion of an unspecified \"[[Autonomous administrative division|autonomy]]\", further undermining the independence camp. Morocco was also allowed to keep its army in the area and retain control over all security issues during both the autonomy years and the election. In 2002, the Moroccan king stated that the referendum idea was \"out of date\" since it \"cannot be implemented\";<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&topic=SEWSA |title=CountryWatch&nbsp;\u2013 Interesting Facts Of The World |publisher=Countrywatch.com |access-date=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005160618/http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&topic=SEWSA |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Polisario retorted that that was only because of the King's refusal to allow it to take place.\n\nIn 2003, a new version of the plan was made official, with some additions spelling out the powers of the WSA, making it less reliant on Moroccan [[devolution]]. It also provided further detail on the referendum process in order to make it harder to stall or subvert. This second draft, commonly known as Baker II, was accepted by the Polisario as a \"basis of negotiations\" to the surprise of many.<ref>Shelley, Toby. ''[http://www.merip.org/mero/mero080103.html Behind the Baker Plan for Western Sahara] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210082330/http://www.merip.org/mero/mero080103.html |date=10 December 2006}}'', Middle East Report Online, 1 August 2003. Retrieved 24 August 2006.</ref> This appeared to abandon Polisario's previous position of only negotiating based on the standards of voter identification from 1991 (i.e. the Spanish census). After that, the draft quickly garnered widespread international support, culminating in the UN Security Council's unanimous endorsement of the plan in the summer of 2003.\n\n=== End of the 2000s ===\n{{Update|the [[Manhasset negotiations]] (not in article)|date=September 2013}}\nBaker resigned his post at the United Nations in 2004; his term did not see the crisis resolved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200406141270.html|title=Western Sahara: Baker Resigns As UN Mediator After Seven Years|date=14 June 2004|access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref> His resignation followed several months of failed attempts to get Morocco to enter into formal negotiations on the plan, but he met with rejection. The new king, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]], opposes any referendum on independence, and has said Morocco will never agree to one: \"We shall not give up one inch of our beloved Sahara, not a grain of its sand.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/04apr06/insight/ins4.html|title=Times News \u2013 Bold, Authoritative, and True|website=Times News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605000502/http://www.timesnews.co.ke/04apr06/insight/ins4.html|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInstead, he proposes, through an appointed advisory body [[Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs]] (CORCAS), a self-governing Western Sahara as an autonomous community within Morocco. His father, [[Hassan II of Morocco]], initially supported the referendum idea in principle in 1982, and signed contracts with Polisario and the UN in 1991 and 1997. No major powers have expressed interest in forcing the issue, however, and Morocco has shown little interest in a real referendum.\n\nThe UN has put forth no replacement strategy after the breakdown of Baker II, and renewed fighting has been raised as a possibility. In 2005, former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] reported increased military activity on both sides of the front and breaches of several cease-fire provisions against strengthening military fortifications.\n\nMorocco has repeatedly tried to get Algeria into bilateral negotiations, based on its view of Polisario as the [[The Monkey and the Cat|cat's paw]] of the Algerian military. It has received vocal support from France and occasionally (and currently) from the United States. These negotiations would define the exact limits of a Western Sahara autonomy under Moroccan rule but only after Morocco's \"inalienable right\" to the territory was recognized as a precondition to the talks. The Algerian government has consistently refused, claiming it has neither the will nor the right to negotiate on the behalf of the Polisario Front.\n\nDemonstrations and riots by supporters of independence or a referendum broke out in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara in May 2005 and in parts of southern Morocco (notably the town of [[Assa (Morocco)|Assa]]). They were met by police. Several international human rights organizations expressed concern at what they termed abuse by Moroccan security forces, and a number of Sahrawi activists have been jailed. Pro-independence Sahrawi sources, including the Polisario, have given these demonstrations the name \"[[Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)|Independence Intifada]]\", while most sources have tended to see the events as being of limited importance. International press and other media coverage have been sparse, and reporting is complicated by the Moroccan government's policy of strictly controlling independent media coverage within the territory.\n\n[[File:Manifestation in Madrid for the independence of the Western Sahara (11).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A demonstration in Madrid for the independence of Western Sahara.]]\nDemonstrations and protests still occur, even after Morocco declared in February 2006 that it was contemplating a plan for devolving a limited variant of autonomy to the territory but still explicitly refused any referendum on independence. As of January 2007, the plan had not been made public, though the Moroccan government claimed that it was more or less complete.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/18964 |title=afrol News&nbsp;\u2013 No plans for a referendum in Western Sahara |publisher=Afrol.com |access-date=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nPolisario has intermittently threatened to resume fighting, referring to the Moroccan refusal of a referendum as a breach of the [[Settlement Plan|cease-fire terms]], but most observers seem to consider armed conflict unlikely without the green light from [[Algeria]], which houses the Sahrawis' refugee camps and has been the main military sponsor of the movement.\n\nIn April 2007, the government of Morocco suggested that a self-governing entity, through the [[Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs]] (CORCAS), should govern the territory with some degree of autonomy for Western Sahara. The project was presented to the UN Security Council in mid-April 2007. The stalemating of the Moroccan proposal options has led the UN in the recent \"Report of the UN Secretary-General\" to ask the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/299/28/PDF/N0729928.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western Sahara (13 April 2007)(ped).

The Sahrawis are traditionally nomadic Bedouins with a lifestyle very similar to that of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg Berbers]] from whom Sahrawis most likely have descended, and they can be found in all surrounding countries. War and conflict has led to major population displacement.\n\nAs of July 2004, an estimated 267,405 people (excluding about 160,000 Moroccan military personnel) lived in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara. Many people from parts of Morocco have come to live in the territory, and these latest arrivals are today thought to outnumber the indigenous Western Sahara Sahrawis. The precise size and composition of the population is subject to political controversy.\n\nThe Polisario-controlled parts of Western Sahara are barren. This area has a very small population, estimated to be approximately 30,000 in 2008.<ref name=\"nrc.no\" /> The population is primarily made up of nomads who engage in herding camels back and forth between the [[Tindouf]] area and Mauritania. However, the presence of land mines scattered throughout the territory by the Moroccan army makes it a dangerous way of life.\n\n=== Spanish census and MINURSO ===\nA 1974 Spanish census claimed there were some 74,000 Sahrawis in the area at the time (in addition to approximately 20,000 Spanish residents), but this number is likely to be on the low side, due to the difficulty in counting a nomad people, even if Sahrawis were by the mid-1970s mostly urbanized. Despite these possible inaccuracies, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on using the Spanish census as the basis for voter registration when striking a [[cease-fire]] agreement in the late 1980s, contingent on the holding of a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco.\n\nIn December 1999, the United Nations' [[MINURSO]] mission announced that it had identified 86,425 eligible voters for the referendum that was supposed to be held under the 1991 [[Settlement plan]] and the 1997 [[Houston accords]]. By \"eligible voter\" the UN referred to any Sahrawi over 18 years of age that was part of the Spanish census or could prove their descent from someone who was. These 86,425 Sahrawis were dispersed between Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and the refugee camps in Algeria, with smaller numbers in Mauritania and other places of exile. These numbers cover only Sahrawis 'indigenous' to Western Sahara during the Spanish colonial period, not the total number of \"ethnic\" Sahrawis (i.e., members of Sahrawi tribal groupings), who also extend into Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. The number was highly politically significant due to the expected organization of a referendum on self-determination.\n\nThe Polisario has its home base in the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Tindouf refugee camps]] in Algeria, and declares the number of Sahrawi population in the camps to be approximately 155,000. Morocco disputes this number, saying it is exaggerated for political reasons and for attracting more foreign aid. The UN uses a number of 90,000 \"most vulnerable\" refugees as basis for its food aid program.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Western Sahara}}\n{{See also|Western Saharan cuisine}}\n[[File:Museo de la Guerra en Rabuni, sede del gobierno de la RASD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[People's Liberation Army Museum|Museum of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army]].]]\nThe major ethnic group of Western Sahara are the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]], a nomadic or [[Bedouin]] ethnic group speaking the [[Hassaniya|Hass\u0101n\u012bya]] dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], also spoken in much of Mauritania. They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but claim descent from the [[Beni Hassan]], an Arab tribe that migrated across the desert in the 11th century.\n\nPhysically indistinguishable from the Hassaniya speaking [[Moors]] of Mauritania, the Sahrawi people differ from their neighbours partly because of different tribal affiliations (as tribal confederations cut across present modern boundaries) and partly as a consequence of their exposure to Spanish colonial domination. Surrounding territories were generally under French colonial rule.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=November 2013}}\n\nLike other Saharan Bedouin and Hassaniya groups, the Sahrawis are mostly Muslims of the [[Sunni]] branch and the [[Maliki]] [[fiqh]]. Local religious custom ([[Urf]]) is, like other Saharan groups, heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Berber and African practices, and differs substantially from urban practices. For example, Sahrawi Islam has traditionally functioned without mosques, in an adaptation to nomadic life.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe original [[clan]]-/tribe-based society underwent a massive social upheaval in 1975 when the war forced part of the population to settle in the [[Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|refugee camps of Tindouf]], Algeria, where they remain. Families were broken up by the dispute.\n\nThe [[People's Liberation Army Museum|Museum of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army]] is located in this refugee camp. This museum is dedicated to the struggle for the independence of Western Saharan people. It presents weapons, vehicles and uniforms, as well as abundant documentation history.\n\n=== Cross-cultural influence ===\nThe contemporary history of the territory has experienced long-term international presence and occupation that has deeply influenced the cultural practices of the people, such as languages spoken throughout the territory and its institutions.<ref name=\"San Martin 2005 565\u2013592\">{{Cite journal |last=San Martin|first=Pablo|year=2005|title=Nationalism, identity and citizenship in the Western Sahara|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|publisher= Taylor & Francis|volume=10 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=565\u2013592 |doi=10.1080/13629380500336870}}</ref> Spanish colonization lasted roughly from 1884\u20131976, following the creation of the Madrid Accords where Spain absolved all responsibility over the territory and left it to Morocco and Mauritania.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zunes|first=Stephen|last2= Mundy| first2= Jacob|title=Western Sahara: War, Nationalism, and Conflict Irresolution|publisher= Syracuse UP|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the nine decades of Spanish colonial presence, one of the primary spoken languages in Western Sahara came to be Spanish.

The release includes a DVD of [[Short subject|short films]] that were directed and shot by professional filmmakers and friends, including [[Gorman Bechard]], The Barnes Brothers, Martin Glenn, Matt Boyd and Jared Johnson.

The success helped secure a US release, which was helped further by a placement in the hit CW (former WB) drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. \"For Blue Skies\", a song concerning the sentencing of Matthew Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison, was made available on the [[One Tree Hill Soundtracks]]. Strays Don't Sleep toured the UK with Josh Rouse to support the album. Strays Don't Sleep was officially disbanded mid-2006.

[[Allmusic]] concluded, \"''The native of Chester, PA (near Philadelphia) was 25 at the time, but this is such a mature, emotionally honest effort that one got the impression he'd done more living than usual during his 25 years. Ryan's voice is rough and has a very lived-in quality that proves most appropriate on such tales of loss, disappointment, and hurt as \"Watch Your Step,\" \"Chrome,\" and \"Lights of the Commodore Barry.\" There isn't a lot of hope or optimism here; Ryan obviously didn't hesitate to let some of his darker feelings flow when he went into the studio to record this album, which is as pessimistic as it is soulful, moving and personal.''\"<ref name=\"AllMusicBiography2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/may-day-mw0000027686 | title=AllMusic Review by Alex Henderson | publisher=[[All Music]] | accessdate=July 19, 2015 | author=Henderson, Alex}}</ref> A video was made for \"Guilty\".

The collaboration was much more successful than expected and [[Strays Don't Sleep]] was formed with [[Neilson Hubbard]], Brian Bequette, Billy Mercer, and Steve Latanation.\n\nIn the Autumn 2005 Strays Don't Sleep's debut self-titled album was released in the UK on [[One Little Indian Records]]. The release includes a DVD of [[Short subject|short films]] that were directed and shot by professional filmmakers and friends, including [[Gorman Bechard]], The Barnes Brothers, Martin Glenn, Matt Boyd and Jared Johnson. Matthew Ryan and [[Neilson Hubbard]] also directed three of the short films with the help of Nashville film student, [[Matt Riddlehoover]].

The success helped secure a US release, which was helped further by a placement in the hit CW (former WB) drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. \"For Blue Skies\", a song concerning the sentencing of Matthew Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison, was made available on the [[One Tree Hill Soundtracks]]. Strays Don't Sleep toured the UK with Josh Rouse to support the album. Strays Don't Sleep was officially disbanded mid-2006. Their Music Video DVD Album \"Strays Don't Sleep\" with each song presented by a different director, won the top Award \u2013 The Grand Remi for Best Music Video \u2013 at the 2006 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival in April 2006.

The Ridge is on the territory of the [[Uyghur]] and Raiymbek districts of the Almaty region, falling within the area of the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] and [[China]]. The total length of the Ridge is 310 km, 160 km of which lies in Kazakhstan. The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan at 3,652 m.[2]\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range in the west and the Narat Ridge in the east. The Northern slopes of the Ridge pass into the Ili Valley. Keen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, [[granite]], and [[limestone]]. The slopes are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a [[permafrost]] zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains [[steppe]]s and [[taiga]] forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, steppe bison remains have been found {{citation needed}}.\n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\nThe Keen ridge has a wide variety of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge is home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. Eighty-four species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The most abundant genera found were 48 species of Puccinia and 12 species of Uromyces {{citation needed}}.\n\n== Source and links ==\n* https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g2350619-d15873720-Reviews-Ketmen_Ridge-Almaty_Region.html\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.
