On 2015 January 29 Thursday, he is convicted for driving his [[Hummer]] SUV into his guard Chandrabose at Shoba Ltd's residential township, pinning him against the wall, before attacking him with a metal rod. Chandrabose, aged 50, suffered multiple injuries and despite repeated surgeries, died in hospital after spending two weeks on life support. Nisham supposedly attacked Chandrabose because he was slow in opening the gate to his apartment in Kerala. Chandrabose died of cardiac arrest after spending two weeks on life support. Police had charged Mr Nisham with attempted murder following the attack in Thrissur city. He was arrested on the charge of attempted murder leading to death. After a year of multiple sessions in court, on 20 January 2016, he was found guilty and was sentenced with a life term by Thrissur District Additional Sessions Court on the next day (21 January 2016). As per the verdict he will have to spend 38 years in jail for multiple crimes. Famous Criminal lawyer Advocate Raman pillai appeared for Nisham and Special Public Prosecutor Advocate C P Udayabhanu appeared for Chandrabose. The Verdict was issued by Thrissur District Additional Sessions Judge Mr K P Sudeer.  Earlier the Supreme Court of India had rejected his bail plea, saying the case was \"an example of how the rich have become entirely egocentric and megalomaniacs\".\n\nNisham had run into several controversies in the past as well. In 2013, he had allowed his son Ishaan Nisham, then nine-year-old, to drive his Ferrari in their residential complex in Thrissur, leading to a police case. In the same year he was arrested after he detained a woman police inspector, T Devi, in his car, during a routine traffic inspection. Nisham was under the influence of alcohol. He started arguing, saying no police station in [[Kerala]] was good enough to park his vehicle. To prevent him from driving away, Devi got into the car to take out the keys. At this point, Nisham, who was outside, locked the doors with his remote control, trapping her inside. More policemen arrived and it was only after a heated argument that Nisham let her out.\n\nRecently he has been in the news for having a personal helper in jail alluding to vip treatment where he is serving his term. DIG prisons is investigating the issue.\n\nEarlier, a controversy had erupted over Nisham's stay in jail as on one journey back from court, he was filmed treating his police escorts to a lavish meal, following which five policemen were suspended. Meanwhile, a quick probe has been ordered as it is believed that a nexus between Nisham and police officers exist, giving him access to run his business.\n\n<ref name=\"new013\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/hummer-murder-kerala-beedi-king-nisham-given-life-term/story-60YBNUW5um3rW6THrcVTcI.html |title=A Kerala court on Thursday awarded life imprisonment to tobacco magnate Mohammed Nisham for killing a security guard with his luxury SUV. |website=Hindustan Times |accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"new012\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35359131 |title=Indian tycoon Mohammed Nisham found guilty of murdering guard |website=BBC News |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"news003\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31496994 |title=FAQ: Murder charge for Indian tycoon accused of ramming guard |website=BBC News |accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"news003\"/><ref name=news002>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mohammed-nisham-millionaire-accused-murdering-5177734 |title=Mohammed Nisham: Millionaire accused of murdering security guard because he was too slow opening his front gate |website=Mirror UK |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=news004>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/indian-millionaire-mohammed-nisham-charged-with-murder-via-suv/ |title=Indian millionaire charged with murder via SUV |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=news005>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2015/02/16/kerala-hummer-case-security-guard-rammed-beaten-mohammed-nisham-dies/ |title=Kerala Hummer case: security guard rammed, beaten by Mohammed Nisham dies |website=American Bazaar |accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=news006>{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/kerala-businessman-arrested-for-hitting-guard-with-hummer-car-for-delay-in-opening-gate/ |title=Beedi tycoon held for ramming guard with his Hummer car |website=The Indian Express |accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=news007>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinetrooth.com/2015/01/mohammed-nisham-businessman-cars.html |title=Mohammed Nisham Businessman Cars Collection |website=Cinetrooth |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203024125/http://www.cinetrooth.com/2015/01/mohammed-nisham-businessman-cars.html |archive-date=3 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=news008>{{cite web |url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/more-quirks-of-nisham-comes-to-light.html |title=More quirks of Nisham come to light |website=Manorama Online |accessdate=19 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219183631/http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/more-quirks-of-nisham-comes-to-light.html |archive-date=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=news009>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150201/jsp/nation/story_11020.jsp |title=Beedi boss \u2018Hummers\u2019 gateman |website=The Telegrapt, Calcutta India |accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=news010>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Cocaine-Bust-Flat-not-in-Nishams-name-police-to-verify-documents/articleshow/46092192.cms |title=Cocaine Bust: Flat not in Nisham\u2019s name, police to verify documents |website=The Times of India |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=news011>{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/kerala-father-arrested-for-letting-9-year-old-boy-drive-his-ferrari/article1-1052503.aspx |title=Kerala: father arrested for letting 9-year-old boy drive his Ferrari |website=Hindustan Times |accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=news021>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/businessman-mohammed-nisham-sentenced-to-life-for-killing-guard/article8134378.ece |title=Businessman Mohammed Nisham sentenced to life for killing guard |website=The Hindu |accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=news022>{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/kerala-jailed-beedi-tycoon-mohammed-nisham-running-business-from-prison/426592/ |title=Kerala: Jailed \u2018beedi tycoon\u2019 Mohammed Nisham running business from prison!

Smirnov''' and '''D. Smirnov-Sadovsky''', was a Russian-British composer.\n\n==Biography==\nSmirnov was born in [[Minsk]] into a family of opera singers Nikolay Senkin-Sadovsky and Eugenia Smirnova. He studied at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] 1967\u20131972 under [[Nikolai Sidelnikov]], [[Yuri Kholopov]] and [[Edison Denisov]]. He also studied privately with [[Philip Herschkowitz]], a pupil of both [[Alban Berg|Berg]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]]. He was married to the composer [[Elena Firsova]].  Their children are [[Philip Firsov]] (an artist and sculptor), and [[Alissa Firsova]] (a composer, pianist and conductor).\n\nHis ''Solo for Harp'' won First Prize in a competition in [[Maastricht]] (1976). His two operas  ''[[Tiriel (opera)|Tiriel]]'' and ''[[Thel (opera)|Thel]]'' on a text by [[William Blake]]  were premiered in 1989 (the first at the [[Freiburg]] Festival, Germany, and the second at the [[Almeida Theatre|Almeida]] Festival in London). The same year, his First Symphony (''The Seasons'') was performed at the [[Tanglewood]] Festival in the  United States. His orchestral ''Mozart-Variations'' were staged as a ballet in [[Pforzheim]] in Germany (1992). Other premieres include the oratorio ''A Song of Liberty'' ([[Leeds]], UK \u2013 1993), Cello Concerto ([[Manchester]], UK \u2013 1996), cantata ''Song of Songs'', ([[Geneva]], Switzerland \u2013 2001) Triple Concerto 2 ([[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]], [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London \u2013 2004). Many of Smirnov's works reflect his fascination with the poetry and art of [[William Blake]].\n\nIn 1979 he was blacklisted as one of the \"[[Khrennikov's Seven]]\" at the Sixth Congress of the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West. He was one of the founders of Russia's new ''[[ACM - Association for Contemporary Music]]'', established in Moscow in 1990. From 1991 Smirnov was resident of England. He was a ''Composer-in-Residence'' at [[University of Cambridge]] ([[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]), at [[Dartington]], and ''Visiting Professor'' at [[Keele University]] (1993\u20138). In 1998 Smirnov and his family settled in [[St Albans]]. From 2003 he taught at the [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].\n\nHis work has been performed by many notable conductors, including: [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Sir Andrew Davis]], [[Dennis Russell Davies]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Vassily Sinaisky]], [[Pavel Kogan (conductor)|Pavel Kogan]], [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and [[Yan Pascal Tortelier]].

The badges served to mark the wearer as a religious or ethnic outsider, and often served as a [[badge of shame]].<ref>{{cite book |author=D'Ancona, Jacob |title=The City Of Light |publisher=Citadel |location=New York |year= 2003 |pages= 23\u201324|isbn=0-8065-2463-4 |quote=But the wearing of a badge or outward sign \u2014 whose effect, intended or otherwise, successful or not, was to shame and to make vulnerable as well as to distinguish the wearer\u2026}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Islamic world===\nThe practice of wearing special clothing or markings to distinguish Jews and other non-Muslims ([[Dhimmi]]s) in Muslim-dominated countries seems to have been introduced in the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by Caliph [[Umar II]] in the early 8th century. The practice was reissued and reinforced by Caliph [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (847\u2013861), subsequently remaining in force for centuries.<ref>Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1 By Richard S.

These measures were not seen as being inconsistent with ''{{lang|la|[[Sicut Judaeis]]}}''. Although not the first ecclesiastic requirement for non-Christians to wear distinguishable clothing, the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] headed by [[Pope Innocent III]] ruled in 1215 that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishable dress (Latin ''{{lang|la|habitus}}''). Canon 68 reads, in part:\n\n{{quote|In some provinces a difference in dress distinguishes the Jews or [[Saracen]]s from the Christians, but in certain others such a confusion has grown up that they cannot be distinguished by any difference. Thus it happens at times that through error Christians have relations with the women of Jews or Saracens, and Jews and Saracens with Christian women. Therefore, that they may not, under pretext of error of this sort, excuse themselves in the future for the excesses of such prohibited intercourse, we decree that such Jews and Saracens of both sexes in every Christian province and at all times shall be marked off in the eyes of the public from other peoples through the character of their dress. Particularly, since it may be read in the writings of Moses [{{bibleverse||Numbers|15:37\u201341|NIV}}], that this very law has been enjoined upon them.<ref name=fordham>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/lateran4.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>}}\n\nInnocent III had in 1199 confirmed ''{{lang|la|Sicut Judaeis}}'', which was also confirmed by [[Pope Honorius III]] in 1216.

Thus it happens at times that through error Christians have relations with the women of Jews or Saracens, and Jews and Saracens with Christian women. Therefore, that they may not, under pretext of error of this sort, excuse themselves in the future for the excesses of such prohibited intercourse, we decree that such Jews and Saracens of both sexes in every Christian province and at all times shall be marked off in the eyes of the public from other peoples through the character of their dress.
