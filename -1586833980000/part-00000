With the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865 and the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, waves of new migrants and immigrants reached the Great Plains, and they greatly increased the acreage under cultivation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm | title = The Great Plains: from dust to dust | publisher = Planning Magazine | date = December 1987 | accessdate = December 6, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006015832/http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm |archivedate = October 6, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Regions\">{{cite book | year =  1995 | url = http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu14re/uu14re00.htm  | title = Regions at Risk: a comparison of threatened environments | publisher = United Nations University Press | accessdate = December 6, 2007}}</ref>  An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that \"[[rain follows the plow]]\" (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the climate of the region had changed permanently.<ref>{{cite book | year =  2006 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/DustBowl/DroughtintheDustBowlYears.aspx| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher = National Drought Mitigation Center | location = US | accessdate = December 6, 2007}}</ref>  While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily [[cattle ranch]]ing, the adverse effect of harsh winters on the cattle, beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general [[overgrazing]], led many landowners to increase the amount of land under cultivation.\n\nRecognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the United States government expanded on the {{convert|160|acre}} offered under the Homestead Act \u2013 granting {{convert|640|acre}} to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the [[Kinkaid Act]] (1904) and {{convert|320|acres}} elsewhere in the Great Plains under the [[Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909]]. Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century.  A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \"formerly\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\n\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the [[Russian Revolution]], which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and [[World War I]] increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation.  For example, in the [[Llano Estacado]] of [[eastern New Mexico]] and northwestern [[Texas]], the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale [[erosion]] under certain environmental conditions.<ref name = drought />  The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods.  Furthermore, [[cotton]] farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and [[Stubble burning|burned]] the [[Crop residue|stubble]] as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.\n\n==Drought and dust storms==\n[[File:Wea01422.jpg|thumb|A [[dust storm]]; [[Spearman, Texas|Spearman]], [[Texas]], April 14, 1935]]\n[[File:Dust bowl, Texas Panhandle, TX fsa.8b27276 edit.jpg|thumb|Heavy black clouds of dust rising over the Texas Panhandle, Texas, c. 1936]]\nAfter fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/tavg/6/03/1895-2014?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1896&lastbaseyear=1967&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1968&lasttrendyear=2014&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Average Temperature \u2013 October to March|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Precipitation, 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/14/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Kansas Precipitation 1895 to 2013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> and the entire region south to West Texas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/41/01/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Texas Climate Division 1 (High Plains): Precipitation 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/mwr/069/mwr-069-12-0360.pdf|title=The Weather of 1941 in the United States|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> When severe [[drought]] struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time.

Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated.  Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.<ref>Gregory, N. James. (1991) ''American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California.'' Oxford University Press.</ref> The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time.  After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.<ref>Babb, et al. (2007), ''On the Dirty Plate Trail,'' p. 13</ref>\n\n==U.S. government response==\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the [[Soil Conservation Service]] generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the [[United States Forestry Service]]'s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the [[Farm Security Administration]], encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in drier parts of the Plains.<ref name=\"whatwelearned\"/>\n\nDuring President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to [[Soil conservation|conserve soil]] and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes]] established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under [[Hugh Hammond Bennett]]. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and renamed the Soil Conservation Service.  It is now known as the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS).<ref>Steiner, Frederick (2008). ''The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning'', p. 188. Island Press. {{ISBN|1-59726-396-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs part of [[New Deal]] programs, Congress passed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act]] in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\"<ref>Rau, Allan.

It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]] (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA <!--Which AAA is this?-->commented,\n\n<blockquote>Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program \u2013 we can prove it \u2013 saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.</blockquote>\n\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations.  Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels.  Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/|title=The American Experience / Surviving the Dust Bowl / Timeline}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a [[Drought Relief Service]] (DRS) to coordinate relief activities.  The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head.  Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide.  Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\"<ref>''Monthly Catalog,'' United States Public Documents, By United States Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Published by the G.P.O., 1938</ref>\n\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to plant the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], a huge belt of more than 200&nbsp;million trees from Canada to [[Abilene, Texas]] to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on [[soil conservation]] and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, [[strip farming]], [[contour plowing]], terracing, and other improved farming practices.<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas|author=Federal Writers' Project|location=Writers' Program (Tex.)|publisher=Writers' Program Texas|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma|first=James Shannon|last=Buchanan|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|page=224}}</ref>  In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil.  The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods.  By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/dustbowl/ PBS Timeline of Dust Bowl]</ref> The land still failed to yield a decent living.  In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\n\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.<ref>''A Cultural History'' (1999),  p.45.</ref>\n\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.<ref>United States.

[[Land degradation]] varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\n\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.<ref name=\"hornbeck\">{{cite journal |last=Hornbeck|first= Richard| title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short and Long-run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2012 |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1477\u20131507 |doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11303325}}</ref>{{rp|3}}  Even over the long-term, the agricultural value of the land often failed to recover to pre-Dust Bowl levels.  In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered.  The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.<ref name=\"hornbeck2012\">{{citation| url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hornbeck/files/hornbeck_dustbowl.pdf?m=1360041873 | title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short- and Long-Run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe | last=Hornbeck | first=Richard | date=June 2012 | via=Harvard University, Department of Economics | journal=American Economic Review | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=1477\u20131507 | doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 | format=PDF | access-date=March 31, 2016 | mode=cs1 }}</ref>{{rp|1500}}\n\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas.  Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay.  During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\n\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use.  A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states.  Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.<ref>{{Cite journal| last= Landon-Lane|first= John| first2= Hugh |last2=Rockoff |first3=Richard |last3=Steckel |title=Droughts, Floods, and Financial Distress in the United States |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 15596 |page=6 |doi=10.3386/w15596 |date=December 2009 }}</ref> In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\n\n[[Patrick Allitt]] recounts how fellow historian [[Donald Worster]] responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\n:Capital-intensive agribusiness had transformed the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not.  According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return.  In Worster's view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America's capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing.  They  were continuing to work in an unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  p 203</ref>\n\nIn contrast with Worster's pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield  argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\"<ref>Allitt p 211, paraphrasing William Cronin's evaluation of Mathew Paul Bonnifield, ''Dust Bowl: Men, Dirt and Depression''(1979)</ref>\n\n==Influence on the arts and culture==\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Owens Thompson]] seen in the photo ''Destitute Pea Pickers in California.

Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century.  A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \"formerly\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\n\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the [[Russian Revolution]], which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and [[World War I]] increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation.  For example, in the [[Llano Estacado]] of [[eastern New Mexico]] and northwestern [[Texas]], the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale [[erosion]] under certain environmental conditions.<ref name = drought />  The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods.

Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated.  Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.<ref>Gregory, N. James. (1991) ''American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California.'' Oxford University Press.</ref> The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time.  After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.<ref>Babb, et al. (2007), ''On the Dirty Plate Trail,'' p. 13</ref>\n\n==U.S. government response==\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the [[Soil Conservation Service]] generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the [[United States Forestry Service]]'s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the [[Farm Security Administration]], encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in drier parts of the Plains.<ref name=\"whatwelearned\"/>\n\nDuring President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to [[Soil conservation|conserve soil]] and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes]] established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under [[Hugh Hammond Bennett]]. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and renamed the Soil Conservation Service.  It is now known as the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS).<ref>Steiner, Frederick (2008). ''The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning'', p. 188. Island Press. {{ISBN|1-59726-396-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs part of [[New Deal]] programs, Congress passed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act]] in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\"<ref>Rau, Allan.

Droz, 1957. p. 81.</ref> Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909\u20131914.\n\nTo stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered. It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]] (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA <!--Which AAA is this?-->commented,\n\n<blockquote>Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program \u2013 we can prove it \u2013 saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.</blockquote>\n\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations.  Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels.  Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/|title=The American Experience / Surviving the Dust Bowl / Timeline}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a [[Drought Relief Service]] (DRS) to coordinate relief activities.  The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head.  Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide.  Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\"<ref>''Monthly Catalog,'' United States Public Documents, By United States Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Published by the G.P.O., 1938</ref>\n\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to plant the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], a huge belt of more than 200&nbsp;million trees from Canada to [[Abilene, Texas]] to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on [[soil conservation]] and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, [[strip farming]], [[contour plowing]], terracing, and other improved farming practices.<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas|author=Federal Writers' Project|location=Writers' Program (Tex.)|publisher=Writers' Program Texas|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma|first=James Shannon|last=Buchanan|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|page=224}}</ref>  In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil.

In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\n\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.<ref>''A Cultural History'' (1999),  p.45.</ref>\n\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.<ref>United States.

[[Land degradation]] varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\n\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values.

The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.<ref name=\"hornbeck2012\">{{citation| url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hornbeck/files/hornbeck_dustbowl.pdf?m=1360041873 | title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short- and Long-Run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe | last=Hornbeck | first=Richard | date=June 2012 | via=Harvard University, Department of Economics | journal=American Economic Review | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=1477\u20131507 | doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 | format=PDF | access-date=March 31, 2016 | mode=cs1 }}</ref>{{rp|1500}}\n\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas.  Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay.  During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\n\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use.  A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states.  Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.<ref>{{Cite journal| last= Landon-Lane|first= John| first2= Hugh |last2=Rockoff |first3=Richard |last3=Steckel |title=Droughts, Floods, and Financial Distress in the United States |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 15596 |page=6 |doi=10.3386/w15596 |date=December 2009 }}</ref> In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\n\n[[Patrick Allitt]] recounts how fellow historian [[Donald Worster]] responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\n:Capital-intensive agribusiness had transformed the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not.  According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return.  In Worster's view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America's capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing.  They  were continuing to work in an unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  p 203</ref>\n\nIn contrast with Worster's pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield  argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\"<ref>Allitt p 211, paraphrasing William Cronin's evaluation of Mathew Paul Bonnifield, ''Dust Bowl: Men, Dirt and Depression''(1979)</ref>\n\n==Influence on the arts and culture==\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Owens Thompson]] seen in the photo ''Destitute Pea Pickers in California.

Agricultural land and revenue boomed during World War I, but fell during the Great Depression and the 1930s. The land and revenue began increasing again in 1940, and has been increasing since then. From 1910 to the 1940s, total farmland increased and remained constant until 1970 when it slightly declined.
