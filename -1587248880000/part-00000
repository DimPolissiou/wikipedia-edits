He worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nMacron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the [[French cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy and Industry]] in August 2014 by [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Manuel Valls]]. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]]. Although Macron had been a member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|En Marche]].\n\nThough initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]]. He quickly appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister, and in the [[2017 French legislative election|legislative elections]] a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in [[History of France|French history]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a [[physician]], and [[Jean-Michel Macron]], professor of [[neurology]] at the [[University of Picardy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/politique/dans-un-livre-anne-fulda-raconte-macron-cote-intime-3297407 |accessdate=25 April 2017 |date=21 April 2017 |title=Dans un livre, Anne Fulda raconte Macron c\u00f4t\u00e9 intime|publisher=JDD \u00e0 la Une |language=fr }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Badeau|first=Kevin|title=Le livre qui raconte l'intimit\u00e9 d'Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/editos-analyses/0211955006642-le-livre-qui-raconte-lintimite-demmanuel-macron-2078386.php|newspaper=Les Echos|date=7 April 2017|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref> The couple divorced in 2010.

mi\u0283\u025bl f\u0281ede\u0281ik mak\u0281\u0254\u0303|lang}}; born 21 December 1977) is a French politician who has been [[President of France]] and ''ex officio'' [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] since 14 May 2017.\n\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Macron studied [[philosophy]] at [[Paris Nanterre University]], later completing a master's degree in public affairs at [[Sciences Po]] and graduating from the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nMacron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the [[French cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy and Industry]] in August 2014 by [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Manuel Valls]]. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]]. Although Macron had been a member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|En Marche]].\n\nThough initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]]. He quickly appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister, and in the [[2017 French legislative election|legislative elections]] a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in [[History of France|French history]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a [[physician]], and [[Jean-Michel Macron]], professor of [[neurology]] at the [[University of Picardy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/politique/dans-un-livre-anne-fulda-raconte-macron-cote-intime-3297407 |accessdate=25 April 2017 |date=21 April 2017 |title=Dans un livre, Anne Fulda raconte Macron c\u00f4t\u00e9 intime|publisher=JDD \u00e0 la Une |language=fr }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Badeau|first=Kevin|title=Le livre qui raconte l'intimit\u00e9 d'Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/editos-analyses/0211955006642-le-livre-qui-raconte-lintimite-demmanuel-macron-2078386.php|newspaper=Les Echos|date=7 April 2017|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref> The couple divorced in 2010.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests. Since cyanide has a short half-life, the main metabolite, thiocyanate is typically measured to determine exposure. Other methods of detection include the identification of plasma lactate.\n\n==Treatment==\n===Decontamination===\nDecontamination of people exposed to hydrogen cyanide gas only requires removal of the outer clothing and the washing of their hair.<ref name=NIH2015/> Those exposed to liquids or powders generally require [[Human decontamination|full decontamination]].<ref name=NIH2015/>\n\n===Antidote===\nThe United States standard cyanide [[antidote]] kit first uses a small inhaled dose of [[amyl nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium thiosulfate]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|overview}}</ref> [[Hydroxocobalamin]] is newly approved in the US and is available in Cyanokit antidote kits.<ref name=EmedTreat>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|treatment}}</ref> [[Sulfanegen TEA]], which could be delivered to the body through an intra-muscular (IM) injection, detoxifies cyanide and converts the cyanide into [[thiocyanate]], a less toxic substance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/antidote-cyanide-found-132827160.html |title=New Antidote for Cyanide Found |accessdate=14 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305003617/http://news.yahoo.com/antidote-cyanide-found-132827160.html |archivedate=5 March 2016  }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Alternative methods of treating cyanide intoxication are used in other countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide; otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |name-list-format=vanc|year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414\u20136 |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Glucose]]\n| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests. Since cyanide has a short half-life, the main metabolite, thiocyanate is typically measured to determine exposure.

However, this reaction occurs too slowly in the body for thiosulfate to be adequate by itself in acute cyanide poisoning. Thiosulfate must therefore be used in combination with nitrites.<ref name=\"emedicine.medscape.com\"/>\n|-cyanide can be found on a silver back lizard frog from the village called Bodelwyddan in the north of Wales.\n| [[Hydroxocobalamin]]\n|[[Hydroxocobalamin]], a form (or [[vitamer]]) of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] made by bacteria, and sometimes denoted vitamin B<sub>12a</sub>, is used to bind cyanide to form the harmless [[cyanocobalamin]] form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. \n|-\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]]\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]] (4-DMAP) has been proposed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} in Germany as a more rapid antidote than nitrites with (reportedly) lower toxicity.  4-DMAP is used currently by the German military and by the civilian population.  In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide; otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |name-list-format=vanc|year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414\u20136 |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Glucose]]\n| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.  For this reason, glucose is often administered alongside this agent (e.g. in the formulation 'Kelocyanor').<BR>It has also been anecdotally suggested that glucose is itself an effective counteragent to cyanide, reacting with it to form less toxic compounds that can be eliminated by the body. One theory on the apparent immunity of [[Grigori Rasputin]] to cyanide was that his killers put the poison in sweet pastries and [[madeira wine]], both of which are rich in sugar; thus, Rasputin would have been administered the poison together with massive quantities of antidote.
