It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, which makes it one of [[Early cantata (Bach)|Bach's earliest cantatas]]. Some sources suggest that it could be his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples.\n\nThe cantata was commissioned by the minister of one of the churches in [[M\u00fchlhausen]], the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s German version of [[Psalm 130]] and also incorporates the words of a [[chorale]]. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in [[counterpoint]], something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.\n\n== History and words ==\n\nA note on the [[autograph]] score of the cantata indicates that the work was commissioned by Georg Christian Eilmar, minister of the [[St. Mary's Church, M\u00fchlhausen|Marienkirche]] (St. Mary's church) in [[M\u00fchlhausen]].  This allows the work to be dated to 1707\u201308, which is the period when Bach was living in M\u00fchlhausen.  Bach was employed as organist at the city's other main church, [[Divi Blasii, M\u00fchlhausen|Divi Blasii]],.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=104}} He was also involved to some extent with performances at the Marienkirche, where civic ceremonies were held.  One service there which Bach would have attended was that for the city council's inauguration in 1708 during which his cantata [[Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig, BWV 71|''Gott ist mein Konig'', BWV 71]] had its premiere. He may have had a closer personal relationship with Eilmar than with the minister of his own church. Eilmar was godfather to his daughter Catharina Dorothea (born 1708).{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=112}}\n\n{{lang|de|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir}} has been described as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e522 | title=Bach, Johann Sebastian | publisher=[[Oxford Music Online]] (subscription access) | work=[[The Oxford Companion to Music]].

It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt. Although Bach was only 22 when he took up the appointment at M\u00fchlhausen, the performance of a work of his own composition appears to have been part of the selection process.{{sfn|Geck|2006|p=64}}  Recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata [[Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150|''Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich'', BWV 150]] could have been composed at Arnstadt.<ref name=\"Isoyama\">{{cite web | last = Isoyama | first = Tadashi | url = http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Pic-Rec-BIG/Suzuki-C01a%5BBIS-CD751%5D.pdf   | title = Cantata No. 150 Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich (BWV 150) | publisher = Bach-Cantatas | year = 1995 | page = 7 | accessdate = 26 January 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[libretto]] is based on [[Psalm 130]], one of the [[penitential psalms]].

The hymn is also penitential. Bach later used it as the basis for the cantata {{lang|de|[[Herr Jesu Christ, du h\u00f6chstes Gut, BWV 113|''Herr Jesu Christ, du h\u00f6chstes Gut'', BWV 113]]|italic=unset}}, where the words form a counterpart to the tax collector's prayer in the parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]], the [[Gospel (liturgy)|gospel reading]] for the eleventh Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]].\n\nIn his [[Bach Cantata Pilgrimage]], Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] performed and recorded the work with cantatas for the Fifth Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]],<ref name=cantatafinder>This was partly for a practical reason, the paucity of surviving cantatas for that particular Sunday.

(Bach later came more under the influence of Italian music, combining recitatives and arias).<ref name=\"emmanuel\" />\n\nBach did not give a direct indication of how many singers he envisaged in the choir.  The cantata can be performed with only four singers, as in the recording by [[Joshua Rifkin]], who is well known in the world of Bach performance for his \"[[OVPP|one voice to a part]]\" approach. However, most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part.  Another choice to be made is whether to use women singers: Bach's original singers were probably all male.<ref name=\"Women\">{{cite web | url=http://ism.yale.edu/event/conference-womens-influence-js-bachs-music | title=Considering Women's Impact on the Music of Johann Sebastian Bach | publisher=[[Yale Institute of Sacred Music]] | accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>  Most recordings of the cantata, however, feature mixed choirs: an exception is the version conducted by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]], which deploys boys' voices as the top lines of the choir.<ref>Recorded in 1981,[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Performers/H&L-Rec6.htm#L32] this version is part of a [[Bach cantatas (Teldec)|complete set of the cantatas]], a joint project with [[Gustav Leonhardt]], which mainly uses male voices.</ref>\n\n=== Instruments ===\nThe singers are accompanied by an [[Baroque instruments|instrumental group]] consisting of [[oboe]], [[bassoon]], [[violin]], two [[viola]]s and [[basso continuo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~wfb/cantatas/131.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|publisher=University of Alberta|title=BWV 131}}</ref> As in the case of the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. [[Ton Koopman]], for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide [[accompaniment]], filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.<ref name=\"emmanuel\">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/notes_cantata/n_bwv131.htm | title=Cantata 131; Programme Notes | publisher=[[Emmanuel Music]] | accessdate=September 3, 2012 | author=Smith, Craig}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical forms ===\n[[File:Young Bach2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=disputed portrait of the young Bach, with brown curled hair, dressed festively|Portrait of the young Bach (disputed)<ref>{{cite web|last=Towe|first=Teri Noel|title=The Portrait in Erfurt Alleged to Depict Bach, the Weimar Concertmeister|work=The Face Of Bach|url=http://www.npj.com/thefaceofbach/09w624.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074347/http://www.npj.com/thefaceofbach/09w624.html|archivedate=16 July 2011|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>]]\nBach used some musical forms which reappear in later cantatas.  For example, two of the choral movements have a [[fugue]], a style of composition in which Bach excelled.

In both solo movements, a chorale stanza sung simultaneously by the soprano intensifies the Psalm text.

It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, which makes it one of [[Early cantata (Bach)|Bach's earliest cantatas]]. Some sources suggest that it could be his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples.\n\nThe cantata was commissioned by the minister of one of the churches in [[M\u00fchlhausen]], the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s German version of [[Psalm 130]] and also incorporates the words of a [[chorale]]. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in [[counterpoint]], something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.\n\n== History and words ==\n\nA note on the [[autograph]] score of the cantata indicates that the work was commissioned by Georg Christian Eilmar, minister of the [[St. Mary's Church, M\u00fchlhausen|Marienkirche]] (St. Mary's church) in [[M\u00fchlhausen]].  This allows the work to be dated to 1707\u201308, which is the period when Bach was living in M\u00fchlhausen.  Bach was employed as organist at the city's other main church, [[Divi Blasii, M\u00fchlhausen|Divi Blasii]],.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=104}} He was also involved to some extent with performances at the Marienkirche, where civic ceremonies were held.  One service there which Bach would have attended was that for the city council's inauguration in 1708 during which his cantata [[Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig, BWV 71|''Gott ist mein Konig'', BWV 71]] had its premiere. He may have had a closer personal relationship with Eilmar than with the minister of his own church. Eilmar was godfather to his daughter Catharina Dorothea (born 1708).{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=112}}\n\n{{lang|de|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir}} has been described as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e522 | title=Bach, Johann Sebastian | publisher=[[Oxford Music Online]] (subscription access) | work=[[The Oxford Companion to Music]].

It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt. Although Bach was only 22 when he took up the appointment at M\u00fchlhausen, the performance of a work of his own composition appears to have been part of the selection process.{{sfn|Geck|2006|p=64}}  Recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata [[Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150|''Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich'', BWV 150]] could have been composed at Arnstadt.<ref name=\"Isoyama\">{{cite web | last = Isoyama | first = Tadashi | url = http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Pic-Rec-BIG/Suzuki-C01a%5BBIS-CD751%5D.pdf   | title = Cantata No. 150 Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich (BWV 150) | publisher = Bach-Cantatas | year = 1995 | page = 7 | accessdate = 26 January 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[libretto]] is based on [[Psalm 130]], one of the [[penitential psalms]].

The hymn is also penitential. Bach later used it as the basis for the cantata {{lang|de|[[Herr Jesu Christ, du h\u00f6chstes Gut, BWV 113|''Herr Jesu Christ, du h\u00f6chstes Gut'', BWV 113]]|italic=unset}}, where the words form a counterpart to the tax collector's prayer in the parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]], the [[Gospel (liturgy)|gospel reading]] for the eleventh Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]].\n\nIn his [[Bach Cantata Pilgrimage]], Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] performed and recorded the work with cantatas for the Fifth Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]],<ref name=cantatafinder>This was partly for a practical reason, the paucity of surviving cantatas for that particular Sunday.

(Bach later came more under the influence of Italian music, combining recitatives and arias).<ref name=\"emmanuel\" />\n\nBach did not give a direct indication of how many singers he envisaged in the choir.  The cantata can be performed with only four singers, as in the recording by [[Joshua Rifkin]], who is well known in the world of Bach performance for his \"[[OVPP|one voice to a part]]\" approach. However, most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part.  Another choice to be made is whether to use women singers: Bach's original singers were probably all male.<ref name=\"Women\">{{cite web | url=http://ism.yale.edu/event/conference-womens-influence-js-bachs-music | title=Considering Women's Impact on the Music of Johann Sebastian Bach | publisher=[[Yale Institute of Sacred Music]] | accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>  Most recordings of the cantata, however, feature mixed choirs: an exception is the version conducted by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]], which deploys boys' voices as the top lines of the choir.<ref>Recorded in 1981,[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Performers/H&L-Rec6.htm#L32] this version is part of a [[Bach cantatas (Teldec)|complete set of the cantatas]], a joint project with [[Gustav Leonhardt]], which mainly uses male voices.</ref>\n\n=== Instruments ===\nThe singers are accompanied by an [[Baroque instruments|instrumental group]] consisting of [[oboe]], [[bassoon]], [[violin]], two [[viola]]s and [[basso continuo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~wfb/cantatas/131.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|publisher=University of Alberta|title=BWV 131}}</ref> As in the case of the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. [[Ton Koopman]], for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide [[accompaniment]], filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines.

For example, two of the choral movements have a [[fugue]], a style of composition in which Bach excelled. Also, the two movements for soloists are developed as a type of [[chorale fantasia]] with the soloist singing the psalm text and an upper voice singing the chorale in long notes as a [[cantus firmus]].<ref name=\"Mincham\">{{cite web | url=http://www.jsbachcantatas.com/documents/chapter-64-bwv-131.htm | title=Chapter 64 BWV 131 Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir | publisher=jsbachcantatas.com | date=December 2010 | accessdate=September 17, 2012 | author=Mincham, Julian}}</ref>   [[Craig Smith (conductor)|Craig Smith]] called the chorale settings \"a window on the future\". However, he criticised the structure of the cantata, saying that it offers evidence that at this stage in his career the composer had difficulty with large forms.<ref name=\"emmanuel\" /> On the other hand, the musicologist Julian Mincham regards the piece as being different from later cantatas rather than inferior to them.<ref name=\"Mincham\" />\n\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nBach structured the cantata in five movements, three choral movements interspersed by an [[arioso]] and an [[aria]]. In both solo movements, a chorale stanza sung simultaneously by the soprano intensifies the Psalm text. He scored it for two soloist ([[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), a [[SATB|four-part choir]], and a small [[Baroque instruments|Baroque instrumental ensemble]] of [[oboe]] (Ob), [[bassoon]] (Fg),  [[violin]] (Vl), two [[viola]]s (Va), and [[basso continuo]].<ref name=\"Bischof\">{{cite web  | last = Bischof  | first = Walter F.  | url = http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~wfb/cantatas/131.html  | title = BWV 150 Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir | publisher = University of Alberta | accessdate = 25 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'').<ref name=\"Bischof\" /> The [[Key (music)|keys]] and [[time signature]]s are taken from [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]],{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|2006|p=}} using the symbol [[File:Commontime inline.png|11px]] for [[common time]] (4/4).

One of the few British survivors of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] as a young officer, he also distinguished himself in the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nSmith-Dorrien held senior commands in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) during the [[First World War]]. He commanded [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] at the [[Battle of Mons]], the first major action fought by the BEF, and the [[Battle of Le Cateau]], where he fought a vigorous and successful defensive action contrary to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], with whom he had had a personality clash dating back some years. In the spring of 1915 he commanded the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. He was relieved of command by French for requesting permission to retreat from the Ypres Salient to a more defensible position.\n\n==Early life==\nHorace Smith-Dorrien<ref>Note: The surname is properly hyphenated though the form \"Smith Dorrien\" is sometimes seen.

He was the twelfth child of sixteen; his eldest brother was [[Thomas Algernon Smith-Dorrien-Smith]], the [[Isles of Scilly#Governors of Scilly|Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly]] from 1872 \u2013 1918.<ref>Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 18th edition, London 1965\u20131972, volume 1, page 87.</ref><ref>Robert A Smith-Dorrien, Col.

He was present at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] on 22 January 1879, serving with the British invasion force as a transport officer for a detachment of [[Royal Artillery]]. As the Zulu [[impi]]s overwhelmed the British lines, destroying it in hand-to-hand fighting, Smith-Dorrien narrowly escaped on his transport pony over 20 miles of rough terrain with twenty Zulu warriors in running pursuit, crossing the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]], 80 yards wide and with a strong current, by holding the tail of a loose horse. Smith-Dorrien was one of fewer than fifty British survivors from the battle (many more native African troops on the British side also survived), and one of only five Imperial officers to escape it with his life.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p185\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 185.</ref> Because of his conduct in trying to help other soldiers escape from the battlefield, including a colonial commisariat officer named Hamer whose life he saved, he was recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]], but it was not awarded. He took part in the rest of that war.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p185\"/> His observations on the difficulty of opening ammunition boxes led to changes in British Army practice for the rest of the war (though modern commentators argue that this was not as important a factor in the defeat as was thought at the time).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p183\"/>\n\n==Egypt, India and Sudan==\nSmith-Dorrien served in [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]]. He was promoted captain on 1 April 1882, appointed assistant chief of police in [[Alexandria]] on 22 August 1882, then given command of Mounted Infantry in Egypt on 3 September 1882, and was seconded to the Egyptian army (1 February 1884).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184, 185\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 185.</ref> During this time, he forged a lifelong friendship with the then [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Major Kitchener]]. He met [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon]] more than once, but his bad knee kept him off the [[Nile Expedition|expedition to relieve Khartoum]]. He served on the [[Suakin Expedition]]. On 30 December 1885, he witnessed the [[Battle of Gennis]], where the British Army fought in red coats for the last time. The next day (31 December 1885) he was given his first independent command, 150 men (a mixture of hussars, mounted infantry and Egyptians) with fifty infantry in reserve. His task was to capture nine Arab river supply boats (nuggars), in order to achieve which he had to exceed his orders by going beyond the village of Surda, making a 60-mile journey on horseback in 24 hours. For this, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1886.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184, 185\"/>\n\nSmith-Dorrien then left active command to go to the [[Staff College, Camberley]] (1887\u20139). Staff College was not yet much respected, and he later recorded that he devoted much time to sport whilst there.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 186.</ref>\n\nHe was posted to [[British Raj|India]], and promoted major on 1 May 1892. He became Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, Bengal, on 1 April 1893 and then Assistant Adjutant General, Bengal, on 27 October 1894.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 184.</ref><ref>The biographical summary given by Tim Travers does not appear to reconcile exactly with that presented by Ian Beckett.

He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 20 May 1898 and appointed Commanding Officer of the 13th Sudanese Battalion (16 July 1898).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/> He fought at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] (2 September 1898), where his infantry fired at Devishes from entrenched positions.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/> He commanded the British troops during the [[Fashoda incident]]. He was promoted brevet colonel 16 November 1898 and Commanding Officer of the [[Sherwood Foresters]] and substantive lieutenant-colonel (1 January 1899).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\n==South Africa==\nOn 31 October 1899, he shipped to South Africa for the [[Second Boer War]], arriving at Durban 13 December 1899, in the middle of \"[[Black Week]]\".<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/> On 2 February 1900, [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] put him in command of the 19th Brigade and, on 11 February, he was promoted to [[major general]], making him one of youngest generals in the British Army at the time.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 187.</ref> He later commanded a division in South Africa.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p291\"/>\n\nHe provided covering fire for French's Cavalry Division at Klipsdrift, and played an important role at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] (18 to 27 February 1900), where he was summoned by Lord Roberts and asked for his views in the presence of [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], French and [[Henry Edward Colvile|Henry Colvile]]. He argued for the use of sapping and fire support, rather than attacking the entrenched enemy over open ground. Kitchener followed him to his horse to remonstrate that he would be \"a made man\" if he attacked as Kitchener wished, to which he replied he had given his views and would only attack if ordered to do so. A week later he took the laager after careful assault.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p187-8\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nAt [[Sanna's Post]] (31 March 1900), Smith-Dorrien ignored inept orders from Colvile to leave wounded largely unprotected and managed an orderly retreat without further casualties. He took part in the [[Battle of Leliefontein]] (7 November 1900). On 6 February 1901, Smith-Dorrien's troops were attacked in the Battle of [[Chrissiesmeer]].\n\nSmith-Dorrien's qualities as a commander meant he was one of few British commanders to enhance his reputation during this war. Smith-Dorrien was [[mentioned in despatches|mentioned three times in despatches]] in the ''London Gazette'' (including by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27459 |date=29 July 1902 |pages=4835\u20134837  }}</ref>), and Ian Hamilton later wrote highly of his performance and his grasp of the men's morale, whilst Roberts also thought highly of his South Africa performance.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p187-8\"/> He was at the top of a list (21 September 1901) of eighteen successful commanders of columns or groups of columns, including Haig and Allenby, whom French commended to Lord Roberts.<ref>Holmes 2004, p114-5</ref>\n\n==India==\n[[File:Horace Smith-Dorrien Vanity Fair 1901-12-05.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Smith-Dorrien caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1901]]\nOn 22 April 1901, he received orders to return to India where he was made [[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant-General]] (6 November 1901)<ref>{{London Gazette | issue=27397 | date=14 January 1902 |page=297}}</ref> under Kitchener (who returned to India after the end of the Second Boer War, in late 1902). He was placed in command of the [[4th (Quetta) Division]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]], a post he held from 30 June 1903 until 1907. He was raised to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1904 and promoted lieutenant general on 9 April 1906. He introduced the Staff Ride, erroneously attributed by [[John Terraine|Terraine]] to Haig.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 188.</ref> He also helped found the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College at Quetta]] in 1907.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/>\n\nIn the dispute between Kitchener and [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] over the role of the Military Member, Smith-Dorrien stayed neutral, torn between his relations with Kitchener and with the Military Member himself, Sir [[Arthur Power Palmer]], who was his wife's uncle.\n\n==Aldershot==\n[[File:Smith-Dorrien House Aldershot 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Smith-Dorrien House]] in [[Aldershot]] was named in his honour]]\nSmith-Dorrien returned to England and, on 1 December 1907, became GOC of the [[Aldershot Command]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28089/pages/8689 |title=The London Gazette, 13 December 1907. 8689 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=13 December 1907 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> During this time, he instituted a number of reforms designed to improve the lot of the ordinary soldier. One was to abandon the practice of posting pickets to police the soldiers when they were outside the base. Another was to improve sports facilities. His reforms earned many plaudits (but were treated as an implied criticism by his predecessor, [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]]).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p189\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 189.</ref>\n\nUnlike many senior generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien could speak to troops with ease and was greatly admired by regimental officers.<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 17.</ref> In prewar training he wanted \"individual initiative and intelligence\" in British soldiers.<ref>Travers 1987, p. 47.</ref> He later wrote: \"one could never become an up-to-date soldier in the prehistoric warfare to be met with against the Dervishes\".<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\nHe improved the frequency and methods of training in marksmanship of all soldiers (including cavalry, and including shooting at moving targets).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p189\"/> During this period, the higher ranks of the army were divided on the best use of cavalry. Smith-Dorrien, along with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]] and others, doubted that cavalry could often be used as ''cavalry'', i.e. that they should still be trained to charge with sword and lance, instead thinking they would be more often deployed as mounted infantry, i.e. using horses for mobility but dismounting to fight. To this end, he took steps to improve the marksmanship of the cavalry. This did not endear him to the ''arme blanche'' ('pro-cavalry') faction, which included French and [[Douglas Haig]], and whose views prevailed after the retirement of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]].\n\n[[Aylmer Haldane]] recorded that at the 1909 manoeuvres French was \"unfair\" in summing up for [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Paget]] against Smith-Dorrien.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\">Travers 1987, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Smith-Dorrien annoyed French \u2013 with whom he had still been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the South African War  \u2013 by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunk soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. On 21 August 1909 he lectured all his cavalry officers \u2013 in the [[16th Lancers]]\u2019 mess \u2013 about the importance of improving their men's musketry. By 1910 the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien objected to French\u2019s womanising, a fact which Richard Holmes attributes in part to Smith-Dorrien being happily married to a young and pretty wife, and French\u2019s nephew later claimed to have overheard \"a ferocious exchange\" between them, in which Smith-Dorrien declared \"Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal\".<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p131-3\">Holmes 2004, p131-3</ref>\n\nHe also tried to get the army to replace the old [[Maxim gun]] with the new [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers Maxim gun]], which weighed less than half as much and had a better water-cooling system, but the War Office did not approve the expenditure.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p190\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 190.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, he was made Aide-de-Camp to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. He was part of the King's hunt in the [[Chitwan District|Chitwan]] area of [[Nepal]]; on 19 December 1911, Smith-Dorrien killed a rhino and on the following day shot a bear.<ref>Kees Rookmaaker, Barbara Nelson and Darrell Dorrington \"The royal hunt of tiger and rhinoceros in the Nepalese terai in 1911\" [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614012414/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/afesg/pachy/pdfs/pachy38.pdf ''Pachyderm''] No. 38, January\u2013June 2005 pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Southern Command==\nOn 1 March 1912, he was appointed GOC [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] (Douglas Haig had succeeded him as GOC Aldershot).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28587/pages/1663 |title=The London Gazette, 5 March 1912, p1663 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=5 March 1912 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> At Southern Command he had jurisdiction over twelve counties and many regimental depots. He had experience of dealing with Territorials (who would make up much of II Corps in 1914) for the first time and instigated training on fire-and-movement withdrawals which would also prove useful at Le Cateau.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p190\"/>\n\nHe was promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] (10 August 1912) and raised to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in 1913.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\nAlthough Smith-Dorrien was perfectly urbane and, by the standards of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested that the pain from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien's temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) to see if he was indeed \"changed and weakened\". [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]] (letter to [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief India]] because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French's enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotion<ref>Holmes 2004, p5</ref>).<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p131-3\"/><ref>Although Holmes does not specifically say so, this presumably refers to the appointment of [[Beauchamp Duff]] in March 1914. Crewe had not yet been [[Secretary of State for India]] in 1909 when [[O'Moore Creagh|O\u2019Moore Creagh]] had succeeded Kitchener.</ref>\n\nUnlike French, he was politically astute enough to avoid becoming entangled in the [[Curragh Incident]] of 1914. Unlike a number of British generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien was not a political intriguer.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p183\"/>\n\n==World War 1==\nIn 1914, the Public Schools [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]] was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war kept him elsewhere, and Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand [[cadet]]s by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present) \"that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust \u2013 probably not more than one-quarter of us \u2013 learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.\"<ref>Donald Christopher Smith, ed.

Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] had wanted [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Sir Herbert Plumer]] but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he knew he could stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref> Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p191\"/><ref>Terraine 1960, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien arrived at GHQ (20 August) and formally asked French's permission to keep a special diary to report privately to the King as His Majesty had requested. French could hardly refuse, but this further worsened their relations.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 212.</ref> Smith-Dorrien later claimed in his memoirs that French had received him \"pleasantly\", but his diary at the time simply records matter-of-factly that he \"motored into to Le Cateau and saw the Commander-in-Chief\" which may be suspiciously brief in contrast to the diary's normally detailed description of other events. There was also personal friction between George Forestier-Walker and [[John Gough (VC)|Johnnie Gough]], the chiefs of staff of II Corps and I Corps respectively.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 192.</ref>\n\n===Mons (23 August 1914)===\nFrench still believed (22 August) that there were only light German forces facing the BEF, but after hearing intelligence that German forces were stronger than thought and that the BEF had moved far ahead of [[Charles Lanrezac|Lanrezac]]'s [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth French Army]] on its right, Sir John cancelled the planned further advance. He told Lanrezac that he would hold his current position for another 24 hours.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\nFrench's and Smith-Dorrien's accounts differ about the conference at 5.30am on 23 August. French's account in his memoirs ''\"1914\"'' stated that he had become doubtful of the advance into Belgium and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat. This agrees largely with French's diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When ''\"1914\"'' was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been \"in excellent form\" at the meeting and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] in the \"Official History\" agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 215\u2013216.</ref> Edmonds \u2013 who was not an eyewitness \u2013 later claimed in his memoirs that French had instructed Smith-Dorrien to \"give battle\" on the line of the Conde Canal, and that when Smith-Dorrien queried whether he was to attack or defend he was simply told, after French had whispered with Murray, \"Don\u2019t ask questions, do as you are told\".<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\"/><ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p193-4\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien's II Corps took the brunt of a heavy assault by the German forces at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], with the Germans under [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] attempting a flanking manoeuvre. [[George Forestier-Walker|Forestier-Walker]], Chief of Staff II Corps, was driven by Smith-Dorrien's foul temper to attempt to resign his post during the Battle of Mons but was told by the BEF Chief of Staff [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] \"not to be an ass\".<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 224.</ref> During the battle of Mons Smith-Dorrien's car was almost struck by a German shell.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p193-4\"/>\n\n===Le Cateau (26 August)===\nFrench ordered a general retreat, during which I Corps (under General [[Douglas Haig]]) and II Corps became separated.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp220-2\">Holmes 2004, pp. 220\u2013222.</ref> French agreed to Haig's retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, the knowledge of Smith-Dorrien. Murray noted in his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night \u2013 making no mention of II Corps's situation.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 195.</ref> Because the German plan was to envelop the BEF from the west, most of the pressure fell on II Corps, which suffered higher casualties (2,000) in its fighting withdrawal on 24 August than at Mons the previous day (1,600).<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 112.</ref>\n\nFrench had a long discussion with Murray and [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] (25 August) as to whether the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for ''both'' I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated on either side of the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Sir John wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp220-2\"/>\n\nOn the evening of 25 August 1914 Smith-Dorrien was unable to locate 4th Division and Cavalry Division. [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]] (GOC [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Division]]) reached him at 2am on 26 August 1914, and reported that his horses and men were \"pretty well played out\", and unless they retreated under cover of darkness there would be no choice but to fight in the morning. Allenby agreed to act under Smith-Dorrien's orders. [[Hubert Hamilton|Hamilton]] (GOC [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) also reported that his men would be unable to get away before 9am, which also left little choice but to fight, lest isolated forces be overwhelmed piecemeal by the Germans.<ref name=\"Terraine 1960, p126-7\">Terraine 1960, pp. 126\u2013127.</ref> A French cavalry corps under [[Andr\u00e9 Sordet|Sordet]] also took part on the west flank.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 200.</ref>\n\nFrench was awakened at 2am on 26 August 1914 with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3:50 am) to assist him. Smith-Dorrien replied that he was \"unable to move a man\". This irritated French, as Haig (who already had serious doubts of French's competence) was a proteg\u00e9 of his.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp 222-3\">Holmes 2004, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien finally managed to locate [[Thomas Snow (British Army officer)|Snow]] (GOC of the newly arrived [[4th Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]), at 5am (his brigades were assembling in their positions between 3.30am and 5.30am). He was not under Smith-Dorrien's orders but agreed to assist II Corps.<ref name=\"Terraine 1960, p126-7\"/> Smith-Dorrien then cancelled his order to retreat, and decided to stand and fight at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]. He still hoped for assistance from I Corps (Haig), which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5am \u2013 woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to \"make every endeavour\" to fall back but that he had \"a free hand as to the method\", which Smith-Dorrien took as a handing him permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation \u2013 by his own account \u2013 by saying \"Good luck to you. Yours is the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days.\"<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp 222-3\" /> Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan]].<ref>Hastings 2013, p222</ref>\n\n[[Alexander von Kluck|Von Kluck]] believed that he was facing the entire BEF (numbering, he believed, six divisions) and hoped to envelop it on both flanks to its destruction, but lack of coordination among the German attacking forces thwarted this ambition.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 132.</ref>\n\n===After Le Cateau===\nSmith-Dorrien's decision to stand and fight enraged French, who accused him of jeopardising the whole BEF. French and his staff believed that II Corps had been destroyed at Le Cateau, although its units reappeared and reassembled after the retreat. Haig, despite believing French to be incompetent, wrote in his journal (4 September 1914) of Smith-Dorrien's \"ill-considered decision\" in electing to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Murray later (in 1933) called Smith-Dorrien \"a straight honourable gentleman, most lovable, kind and generous\" but thought he \"did wrong to fight other than a strong rearguard action\". However, the historian [[John Terraine]] praised Smith-Dorrien's decision, arguing that despite heavy casualties sustained by II Corps in the action, it materially slowed the German advance.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 223\u2013225.</ref>\n\nGHQ (French) fell back to [[Noyon]] on 26 August 1914, and then and the next day Huguet and other French liaison officers attached to it gave Joffre a tale with their communications of shattered British forces falling back from Le Cateau in defeat. In fact Smith-Dorrien's staff had held II Corps' formation together, although at a meeting (held at 2am on 27 August 1914, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ's present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 226.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien (2 September 1914) recorded that his men were much fitter and had recovered their spirits after the Le Cateau engagement.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 178.</ref> Smith-Dorrien's II Corps lead the counter-attack upon the German advance at the subsequent [[First Battle of the Marne]] and the [[First Battle of the Aisne]], [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] to his right being delayed by forests in its path of advance.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 197.</ref>\n\nII Corps, with its heavy casualties was effectively temporarily broken up in late October 1914 to reinforce I Corps (Haig), but Smith-Dorrien was given command of the newly formed [[British Second Army]] which it was reconstituted as 26 December 1914. His writings from the time show that he was fully aware of the importance of artillery, machine guns and aircraft working in close cooperation with the infantry.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 201.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien later recorded that General French inflicted \"pin-pricks\" on him from February 1915 onwards, including the removal of Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p204\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 204.</ref> This was supposedly on the grounds that Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was still waiting to receive its command.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\"/> French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was \"a weak spot\" (5 February 1915). During the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] he was dissatisfied (13 March 1915) at the apparent \"lack of determination\" of Smith-Dorrien's diversionary attacks.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\">Holmes 2004, pp. 272\u2013274, 282\u2013284.</ref> Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: [[Aylmer Haldane]] recorded in his diary on 15 March 1915 that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915.<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 70.</ref> French complained to [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] ([[Secretary of State for War]]) about him on 28 March 1915.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\"/>\n\n===Second Battle of Ypres===\nAt the Second Battle of Ypres, the British were defending a barely-tenable salient of ground, held at great cost at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] five months earlier. On 22 April 1915 the Germans used [[poison gas]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the first time, and heavy casualties were sustained by the British and French troops.\n\nOn 27 April 1915, with a French counterattack to the north of the salient materializing later and on a smaller-scale than promised, Smith-Dorrien recommended withdrawal to the more defensible \"GHQ Line\". French privately agreed with this analysis, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\"/> French wanted the situation kept quiet so as not to distract from the upcoming attack upon Aubers Ridge by Haig's [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (one historian describes this behaviour on French's part as \"cretinous\").<ref name=\"Neillands 2006, p110-4\">Neillands 2006, pp. 110\u2013114.</ref> Smith-Dorrien wrote a long letter on 27 April 1915 explaining the situation to Robertson (then French's Chief of the General Staff BEF). He received in response a curt telephone message telling him that, in French's view, he had adequate troops to defend the salient. A few hours later written orders arrived, directing Smith-Dorrien to turn command of the salient over to [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]]<ref name=\"Neillands 2006, p110-4\"/> and to lend Plumer his chief of staff and such other staff officers as Plumer required. (In practice this meant that Plumer's V Corps, already holding the salient, became an autonomous force reporting directly to GHQ, with Smith-Dorrien left only with II Corps south of the salient). Plumer immediately asked permission for a withdrawal almost identical to that proposed by Smith-Dorrien. After a delay whilst Foch conducted another counterattack, French consented to the action.\n\nOn 30 April 1915, Haig wrote in his diary:\n\n:Sir John also told me Smith-Dorrien had caused him much trouble. 'He was quite unfit [(he said)] to hold the Command of an Army' so Sir J. had withdrawn all troops from him control except the II Corps. Yet Smith-D. stayed on! [He would not resign!] French is to ask Lord Kitchener to find something to do at home. \u2026 He also alluded to Smith-Dorrien's conduct on the retreat, and said he ought to have tried him by Court Martial, because (on the day of [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]) he 'had ordered him to retire at 8 am and he did not attempt to do so [but insisted on fighting in spite of his orders to retire]'.<ref>Sheffield, Gary and Bourne, John (editors) ''Douglas Haig: War Diaries and Letters 1914\u20131918'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005 {{ISBN|0-297-84702-3}} pp. 119\u2013120.[https://archive.org/donate/ <nowiki> [Donate book to Archive.org]</nowiki>]</ref>\n\nAfter French refused permission to retreat, Smith-Dorrien noted (6 May 1915) that the planned counterattack was a complete failure with casualties higher than predicted by GHQ.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 203.</ref> Smith-Dorrien's offer to resign his command on 6 May 1915 was ignored, and on that same day French used the 'pessimism' of the withdrawal recommendation as an excuse to sack him from command of Second Army altogether. [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|\"Wully\" Robertson]] is said to have broken the news to him with the words \" 'Orace, yer for 'ome \" (Robertson was a former enlisted man who dropped his aitches), although by another account he might have said \" 'Orace, yer thrown \" (a cavalry metaphor).\n\nThe Official Historian Brigadier [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] later alleged that French had removed Smith-Dorrien as he was senior to Haig and stood in the way of Haig becoming Commander-in-Chief, and that [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] had put the idea in French's mind, but this may be doubtful as their antipathy went back a long way, and French was later (December 1915) replaced by Douglas Haig as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF against his will.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p204\"/>\n\nSmith-Dorrien was raised to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (14 May 1915) and was briefly appointed GOC [[First Home Army]] (22 June 1915).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\n===Remainder of the war===\nAfter a period in Britain commanding [[First Army (Home Forces)|First Army]] of [[Central Force]], Smith-Dorrien was appointed GOC East Africa (22 November 1915) to fight the Germans in [[German East Africa]] (present day [[Tanzania]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]]) but pneumonia contracted during the voyage to South Africa prevented him from taking command. His former adversary, [[Jan Smuts]], took on this command. Smith-Dorrien took no significant military part in the rest of the war. He returned to England in January 1916 and on 29 January 1917 was appointed [[lieutenant of the Tower of London]].<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\nHe led a campaign in London for moral purity, calling for suppression of \"suggestive or indecent\" media.<ref>Jerry White, ''Zeppelin Nights: London in the First World War'', cited in review by Saul David in ''Evening Standard'', 8 May 2014, page 41.</ref>\n\n===French's memoirs===\nFrench, partly in response to criticism inspired by Smith-Dorrien, later wrote a partial and inaccurate account of the opening of the war in his book ''1914'', which attacked Smith-Dorrien. Smith-Dorrien, as a serving officer, was denied permission to reply in public.\n\nFrench's official despatch after Le Cateau had praised Smith-Dorrien's \"rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity and determination\". In ''1914'' French wrote that this had been written before he knew the full facts, and that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called ''1914'' \"mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too\".<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Horace smith-dorrien grave 1.jpg|thumb|Horace Smith-Dorrien's grave in [[Berkhamsted]]]]\n[[File:Horace smith-dorrien grave 2.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the plate on Smith-Dorrien's gravestone]]\n\nSmith-Dorrien's last position was as [[Governor of Gibraltar]] from 9 July 1918 \u2013 26 May 1923, where he introduced an element of democracy and closed some brothels. According to [[Wyndham Childs]] in the summer of 1918, Smith-Dorrien tried, and nearly succeeded, in uniting the [[Comrades of the Great War]], the [[National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers]], and the [[National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers]] into one organisation. The merger later took place in 1921 to form the [[The Royal British Legion|British Legion]], under the influence of Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]].<!-- Check names against Childs: might be British Federation of Discharged Sailors & Soldiers. The Officers' Association not formed until 1920.-->\n\nHe retired in September 1923, living in Portugal and then England. He devoted much his time to the welfare and remembrance of Great War soldiers. He worked on his memoirs, which were published in 1925. As French was still alive at the time of writing, he still felt unable to rebut ''1914''. Despite his treatment by French, in 1925, he journeyed across Europe to act as a pallbearer at French's funeral,<ref>Neillands 2006, p. 116.</ref> an act appreciated by French's son.\n\nHe played himself in the film ''The Battle of Mons'', released in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/smithdorrien.htm |title=Vintage Video: Sir Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien, 1914 |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/footage/smithdorrien.wmv ''The Battle of Mons''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901205535/http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/footage/smithdorrien.wmv |date=1 September 2006 }} (WMV format, 14 seconds, 377KB).</ref> In June 1925, he unveiled the war memorial in Memorial Avenue, [[Worksop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worksopguardian.co.uk/community/those-were-the-days/when_the_king_came_to_town_1_3787720 |title=When the King came to town |publisher=Worksopguardian.co.uk |date=19 September 2011}}</ref> On 4 August 1930, he unveiled the [[Pozi\u00e8res Memorial]].\n\n==Death==\nSmith-Dorrien died on 12 August 1930 following injuries sustained in a car accident at [[Chippenham]], in [[Wiltshire]]; he was 72 years old.

One of the few British survivors of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] as a young officer, he also distinguished himself in the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nSmith-Dorrien held senior commands in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) during the [[First World War]]. He commanded [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] at the [[Battle of Mons]], the first major action fought by the BEF, and the [[Battle of Le Cateau]], where he fought a vigorous and successful defensive action contrary to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], with whom he had had a personality clash dating back some years. In the spring of 1915 he commanded the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. He was relieved of command by French for requesting permission to retreat from the Ypres Salient to a more defensible position.\n\n==Early life==\nHorace Smith-Dorrien<ref>Note: The surname is properly hyphenated though the form \"Smith Dorrien\" is sometimes seen.

He was present at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] on 22 January 1879, serving with the British invasion force as a transport officer for a detachment of [[Royal Artillery]]. As the Zulu [[impi]]s overwhelmed the British lines, destroying it in hand-to-hand fighting, Smith-Dorrien narrowly escaped on his transport pony over 20 miles of rough terrain with twenty Zulu warriors in running pursuit, crossing the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]], 80 yards wide and with a strong current, by holding the tail of a loose horse. Smith-Dorrien was one of fewer than fifty British survivors from the battle (many more native African troops on the British side also survived), and one of only five Imperial officers to escape it with his life.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p185\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 185.</ref> Because of his conduct in trying to help other soldiers escape from the battlefield, including a colonial commisariat officer named Hamer whose life he saved, he was recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]], but it was not awarded. He took part in the rest of that war.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p185\"/> His observations on the difficulty of opening ammunition boxes led to changes in British Army practice for the rest of the war (though modern commentators argue that this was not as important a factor in the defeat as was thought at the time).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p183\"/>\n\n==Egypt, India and Sudan==\nSmith-Dorrien served in [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]]. He was promoted captain on 1 April 1882, appointed assistant chief of police in [[Alexandria]] on 22 August 1882, then given command of Mounted Infantry in Egypt on 3 September 1882, and was seconded to the Egyptian army (1 February 1884).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184, 185\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 185.</ref> During this time, he forged a lifelong friendship with the then [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Major Kitchener]]. He met [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon]] more than once, but his bad knee kept him off the [[Nile Expedition|expedition to relieve Khartoum]]. He served on the [[Suakin Expedition]]. On 30 December 1885, he witnessed the [[Battle of Gennis]], where the British Army fought in red coats for the last time. The next day (31 December 1885) he was given his first independent command, 150 men (a mixture of hussars, mounted infantry and Egyptians) with fifty infantry in reserve. His task was to capture nine Arab river supply boats (nuggars), in order to achieve which he had to exceed his orders by going beyond the village of Surda, making a 60-mile journey on horseback in 24 hours. For this, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1886.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184, 185\"/>\n\nSmith-Dorrien then left active command to go to the [[Staff College, Camberley]] (1887\u20139). Staff College was not yet much respected, and he later recorded that he devoted much time to sport whilst there.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 186.</ref>\n\nHe was posted to [[British Raj|India]], and promoted major on 1 May 1892. He became Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, Bengal, on 1 April 1893 and then Assistant Adjutant General, Bengal, on 27 October 1894.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 184.</ref><ref>The biographical summary given by Tim Travers does not appear to reconcile exactly with that presented by Ian Beckett.

He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 20 May 1898 and appointed Commanding Officer of the 13th Sudanese Battalion (16 July 1898).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/> He fought at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] (2 September 1898), where his infantry fired at Devishes from entrenched positions.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/> He commanded the British troops during the [[Fashoda incident]]. He was promoted brevet colonel 16 November 1898 and Commanding Officer of the [[Sherwood Foresters]] and substantive lieutenant-colonel (1 January 1899).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\n==South Africa==\nOn 31 October 1899, he shipped to South Africa for the [[Second Boer War]], arriving at Durban 13 December 1899, in the middle of \"[[Black Week]]\".<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/> On 2 February 1900, [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] put him in command of the 19th Brigade and, on 11 February, he was promoted to [[major general]], making him one of youngest generals in the British Army at the time.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 187.</ref> He later commanded a division in South Africa.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p291\"/>\n\nHe provided covering fire for French's Cavalry Division at Klipsdrift, and played an important role at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] (18 to 27 February 1900), where he was summoned by Lord Roberts and asked for his views in the presence of [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], French and [[Henry Edward Colvile|Henry Colvile]]. He argued for the use of sapping and fire support, rather than attacking the entrenched enemy over open ground. Kitchener followed him to his horse to remonstrate that he would be \"a made man\" if he attacked as Kitchener wished, to which he replied he had given his views and would only attack if ordered to do so. A week later he took the laager after careful assault.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p187-8\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nAt [[Sanna's Post]] (31 March 1900), Smith-Dorrien ignored inept orders from Colville to leave wounded largely unprotected and managed an orderly retreat without further casualties. He took part in the [[Battle of Leliefontein]] (7 November 1900). On 6 February 1901, Smith-Dorrien's troops were attacked in the Battle of [[Chrissiesmeer]].\n\nSmith-Dorrien's qualities as a commander meant he was one of few British commanders to enhance his reputation during this war. Smith-Dorrien was [[mentioned in despatches|mentioned three times in despatches]] in the ''London Gazette'' (including by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27459 |date=29 July 1902 |pages=4835\u20134837  }}</ref>), and Ian Hamilton later wrote highly of his performance and his grasp of the men's morale, whilst Roberts also thought highly of his South Africa performance.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p187-8\"/> He was at the top of a list (21 September 1901) of eighteen successful commanders of columns or groups of columns, including Haig and Allenby, whom French commended to Lord Roberts.<ref>Holmes 2004, p114-5</ref>\n\n==India==\n[[File:Horace Smith-Dorrien Vanity Fair 1901-12-05.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Smith-Dorrien caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1901]]\nOn 22 April 1901, he received orders to return to India where he was made [[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant-General]] (6 November 1901)<ref>{{London Gazette | issue=27397 | date=14 January 1902 |page=297}}</ref> under Kitchener (who returned to India after the end of the Second Boer War, in late 1902). He was placed in command of the [[4th (Quetta) Division]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]], a post he held from 30 June 1903 until 1907. He was raised to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1904 and promoted lieutenant general on 9 April 1906. He introduced the Staff Ride, erroneously attributed by [[John Terraine|Terraine]] to Haig.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 188.</ref> He also helped found the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College at Quetta]] in 1907.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p186\"/>\n\nIn the dispute between Kitchener and [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] over the role of the Military Member, Smith-Dorrien stayed neutral, torn between his relations with Kitchener and with the Military Member himself, Sir [[Arthur Power Palmer]], who was his wife's uncle.\n\n==Aldershot==\n[[File:Smith-Dorrien House Aldershot 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Smith-Dorrien House]] in [[Aldershot]] was named in his honour]]\nSmith-Dorrien returned to England and, on 1 December 1907, became GOC of the [[Aldershot Command]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28089/pages/8689 |title=The London Gazette, 13 December 1907. 8689 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=13 December 1907 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> During this time, he instituted a number of reforms designed to improve the lot of the ordinary soldier. One was to abandon the practice of posting pickets to police the soldiers when they were outside the base. Another was to improve sports facilities. His reforms earned many plaudits (but were treated as an implied criticism by his predecessor, [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]]).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p189\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 189.</ref>\n\nUnlike many senior generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien could speak to troops with ease and was greatly admired by regimental officers.<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 17.</ref> In prewar training he wanted \"individual initiative and intelligence\" in British soldiers.<ref>Travers 1987, p. 47.</ref> He later wrote: \"one could never become an up-to-date soldier in the prehistoric warfare to be met with against the Dervishes\".<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\nHe improved the frequency and methods of training in marksmanship of all soldiers (including cavalry, and including shooting at moving targets).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p189\"/> During this period, the higher ranks of the army were divided on the best use of cavalry. Smith-Dorrien, along with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]] and others, doubted that cavalry could often be used as ''cavalry'', i.e. that they should still be trained to charge with sword and lance, instead thinking they would be more often deployed as mounted infantry, i.e. using horses for mobility but dismounting to fight. To this end, he took steps to improve the marksmanship of the cavalry. This did not endear him to the ''arme blanche'' ('pro-cavalry') faction, which included French and [[Douglas Haig]], and whose views prevailed after the retirement of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]].\n\n[[Aylmer Haldane]] recorded that at the 1909 manoeuvres French was \"unfair\" in summing up for [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Paget]] against Smith-Dorrien.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\">Travers 1987, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Smith-Dorrien annoyed French \u2013 with whom he had still been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the South African War  \u2013 by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunk soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. On 21 August 1909 he lectured all his cavalry officers \u2013 in the [[16th Lancers]]\u2019 mess \u2013 about the importance of improving their men's musketry. By 1910 the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien objected to French\u2019s womanising, a fact which Richard Holmes attributes in part to Smith-Dorrien being happily married to a young and pretty wife, and French\u2019s nephew later claimed to have overheard \"a ferocious exchange\" between them, in which Smith-Dorrien declared \"Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal\".<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p131-3\">Holmes 2004, p131-3</ref>\n\nHe also tried to get the army to replace the old [[Maxim gun]] with the new [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers Maxim gun]], which weighed less than half as much and had a better water-cooling system, but the War Office did not approve the expenditure.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p190\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 190.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, he was made Aide-de-Camp to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].

He had experience of dealing with Territorials (who would make up much of II Corps in 1914) for the first time and instigated training on fire-and-movement withdrawals which would also prove useful at Le Cateau.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p190\"/>\n\nHe was promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] (10 August 1912) and raised to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in 1913.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\nAlthough Smith-Dorrien was perfectly urbane and, by the standards of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested that the pain from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien's temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) to see if he was indeed \"changed and weakened\". [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]] (letter to [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief India]] because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French's enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotion<ref>Holmes 2004, p5</ref>).<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p131-3\"/><ref>Although Holmes does not specifically say so, this presumably refers to the appointment of [[Beauchamp Duff]] in March 1914. Crewe had not yet been [[Secretary of State for India]] in 1909 when [[O'Moore Creagh|O\u2019Moore Creagh]] had succeeded Kitchener.</ref>\n\nUnlike French, he was politically astute enough to avoid becoming entangled in the [[Curragh Incident]] of 1914. Unlike a number of British generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien was not a political intriguer.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p183\"/>\n\n==World War 1==\nIn 1914, the Public Schools [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]] was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war kept him elsewhere, and Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand [[cadet]]s by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present) \"that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust \u2013 probably not more than one-quarter of us \u2013 learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.\"<ref>Donald Christopher Smith, ed.

Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] had wanted [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Sir Herbert Plumer]] but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he knew he could stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref> Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p191\"/><ref>Terraine 1960, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien arrived at GHQ (20 August) and formally asked French's permission to keep a special diary to report privately to the King as His Majesty had requested. French could hardly refuse, but this further worsened their relations.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 212.</ref> Smith-Dorrien later claimed in his memoirs that French had received him \"pleasantly\", but his diary at the time simply records matter-of-factly that he \"motored into to Le Cateau and saw the Commander-in-Chief\" which may be suspiciously brief in contrast to the diary's normally detailed description of other events. There was also personal friction between George Forestier-Walker and [[John Gough (VC)|Johnnie Gough]], the chiefs of staff of II Corps and I Corps respectively.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 192.</ref>\n\n===Mons (23 August 1914)===\nFrench still believed (22 August) that there were only light German forces facing the BEF, but after hearing intelligence that German forces were stronger than thought and that the BEF had moved far ahead of [[Charles Lanrezac|Lanrezac]]'s [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth French Army]] on its right, Sir John cancelled the planned further advance. He told Lanrezac that he would hold his current position for another 24 hours.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\nFrench's and Smith-Dorrien's accounts differ about the conference at 5.30am on 23 August. French's account in his memoirs ''\"1914\"'' stated that he had become doubtful of the advance into Belgium and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat. This agrees largely with French's diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When ''\"1914\"'' was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been \"in excellent form\" at the meeting and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] in the \"Official History\" agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 215\u2013216.</ref> Edmonds \u2013 who was not an eyewitness \u2013 later claimed in his memoirs that French had instructed Smith-Dorrien to \"give battle\" on the line of the Conde Canal, and that when Smith-Dorrien queried whether he was to attack or defend he was simply told, after French had whispered with Murray, \"Don\u2019t ask questions, do as you are told\".<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\"/><ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p193-4\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien's II Corps took the brunt of a heavy assault by the German forces at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], with the Germans under [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] attempting a flanking manoeuvre. [[George Forestier-Walker|Forestier-Walker]], Chief of Staff II Corps, was driven by Smith-Dorrien's foul temper to attempt to resign his post during the Battle of Mons but was told by the BEF Chief of Staff [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] \"not to be an ass\".<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 224.</ref> During the battle of Mons Smith-Dorrien's car was almost struck by a German shell.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p193-4\"/>\n\n===Le Cateau (26 August)===\nFrench ordered a general retreat, during which I Corps (under General [[Douglas Haig]]) and II Corps became separated.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp220-2\">Holmes 2004, pp. 220\u2013222.</ref> French agreed to Haig's retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, the knowledge of Smith-Dorrien. Murray noted in his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night \u2013 making no mention of II Corps's situation.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 195.</ref> Because the German plan was to envelop the BEF from the west, most of the pressure fell on II Corps, which suffered higher casualties (2,000) in its fighting withdrawal on 24 August than at Mons the previous day (1,600).<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 112.</ref>\n\nFrench had a long discussion with Murray and [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] (25 August) as to whether the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for ''both'' I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated on either side of the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Sir John wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp220-2\"/>\n\nOn the evening of 25 August 1914 Smith-Dorrien was unable to locate 4th Division and Cavalry Division. [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]] (GOC [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Division]]) reached him at 2am on 26 August 1914, and reported that his horses and men were \"pretty well played out\", and unless they retreated under cover of darkness there would be no choice but to fight in the morning. Allenby agreed to act under Smith-Dorrien's orders. [[Hubert Hamilton|Hamilton]] (GOC [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) also reported that his men would be unable to get away before 9am, which also left little choice but to fight, lest isolated forces be overwhelmed piecemeal by the Germans.<ref name=\"Terraine 1960, p126-7\">Terraine 1960, pp. 126\u2013127.</ref> A French cavalry corps under [[Andr\u00e9 Sordet|Sordet]] also took part on the west flank.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 200.</ref>\n\nFrench was awakened at 2am on 26 August 1914 with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3:50 am) to assist him. Smith-Dorrien replied that he was \"unable to move a man\". This irritated French, as Haig (who already had serious doubts of French's competence) was a proteg\u00e9 of his.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp 222-3\">Holmes 2004, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien finally managed to locate [[Thomas Snow (British Army officer)|Snow]] (GOC of the newly arrived [[4th Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]), at 5am (his brigades were assembling in their positions between 3.30am and 5.30am). He was not under Smith-Dorrien's orders but agreed to assist II Corps.<ref name=\"Terraine 1960, p126-7\"/> Smith-Dorrien then cancelled his order to retreat, and decided to stand and fight at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]. He still hoped for assistance from I Corps (Haig), which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5am \u2013 woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to \"make every endeavour\" to fall back but that he had \"a free hand as to the method\", which Smith-Dorrien took as a handing him permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation \u2013 by his own account \u2013 by saying \"Good luck to you. Yours is the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days.\"<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp 222-3\" /> Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan]].<ref>Hastings 2013, p222</ref>\n\n[[Alexander von Kluck|Von Kluck]] believed that he was facing the entire BEF (numbering, he believed, six divisions) and hoped to envelop it on both flanks to its destruction, but lack of coordination among the German attacking forces thwarted this ambition.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 132.</ref>\n\n===After Le Cateau===\nSmith-Dorrien's decision to stand and fight enraged French, who accused him of jeopardising the whole BEF. French and his staff believed that II Corps had been destroyed at Le Cateau, although its units reappeared and reassembled after the retreat. Haig, despite believing French to be incompetent, wrote in his journal (4 September 1914) of Smith-Dorrien's \"ill-considered decision\" in electing to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Murray later (in 1933) called Smith-Dorrien \"a straight honourable gentleman, most lovable, kind and generous\" but thought he \"did wrong to fight other than a strong rearguard action\". However, the historian [[John Terraine]] praised Smith-Dorrien's decision, arguing that despite heavy casualties sustained by II Corps in the action, it materially slowed the German advance.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 223\u2013225.</ref>\n\nGHQ (French) fell back to [[Noyon]] on 26 August 1914, and then and the next day Huguet and other French liaison officers attached to it gave Joffre a tale with their communications of shattered British forces falling back from Le Cateau in defeat. In fact Smith-Dorrien's staff had held II Corps' formation together, although at a meeting (held at 2am on 27 August 1914, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ's present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 226.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien (2 September 1914) recorded that his men were much fitter and had recovered their spirits after the Le Cateau engagement.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 178.</ref> Smith-Dorrien's II Corps lead the counter-attack upon the German advance at the subsequent [[First Battle of the Marne]] and the [[First Battle of the Aisne]], [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] to his right being delayed by forests in its path of advance.<ref>Terraine 1960, p. 197.</ref>\n\nII Corps, with its heavy casualties was effectively temporarily broken up in late October 1914 to reinforce I Corps (Haig), but Smith-Dorrien was given command of the newly formed [[British Second Army]] which it was reconstituted as 26 December 1914. His writings from the time show that he was fully aware of the importance of artillery, machine guns and aircraft working in close cooperation with the infantry.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 201.</ref>\n\nSmith-Dorrien later recorded that General French inflicted \"pin-pricks\" on him from February 1915 onwards, including the removal of Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p204\">Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 204.</ref> This was supposedly on the grounds that Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was still waiting to receive its command.<ref name=\"Travers 1987, p15-16\"/> French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was \"a weak spot\" (5 February 1915). During the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] he was dissatisfied (13 March 1915) at the apparent \"lack of determination\" of Smith-Dorrien's diversionary attacks.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\">Holmes 2004, pp. 272\u2013274, 282\u2013284.</ref> Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: [[Aylmer Haldane]] recorded in his diary on 15 March 1915 that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915.<ref>Robbins 2005, p. 70.</ref> French complained to [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] ([[Secretary of State for War]]) about him on 28 March 1915.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\"/>\n\n===Second Battle of Ypres===\nAt the Second Battle of Ypres, the British were defending a barely-tenable salient of ground, held at great cost at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] five months earlier. On 22 April 1915 the Germans used [[poison gas]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the first time, and heavy casualties were sustained by the British and French troops.\n\nOn 27 April 1915, with a French counterattack to the north of the salient materializing later and on a smaller-scale than promised, Smith-Dorrien recommended withdrawal to the more defensible \"GHQ Line\". French privately agreed with this analysis, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, pp272-4, 282-4\"/> French wanted the situation kept quiet so as not to distract from the upcoming attack upon Aubers Ridge by Haig's [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (one historian describes this behaviour on French's part as \"cretinous\").<ref name=\"Neillands 2006, p110-4\">Neillands 2006, pp. 110\u2013114.</ref> Smith-Dorrien wrote a long letter on 27 April 1915 explaining the situation to Robertson (then French's Chief of the General Staff BEF). He received in response a curt telephone message telling him that, in French's view, he had adequate troops to defend the salient. A few hours later written orders arrived, directing Smith-Dorrien to turn command of the salient over to [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]]<ref name=\"Neillands 2006, p110-4\"/> and to lend Plumer his chief of staff and such other staff officers as Plumer required. (In practice this meant that Plumer's V Corps, already holding the salient, became an autonomous force reporting directly to GHQ, with Smith-Dorrien left only with II Corps south of the salient). Plumer immediately asked permission for a withdrawal almost identical to that proposed by Smith-Dorrien. After a delay whilst Foch conducted another counterattack, French consented to the action.\n\nOn 30 April 1915, Haig wrote in his diary:\n\n:Sir John also told me Smith-Dorrien had caused him much trouble. 'He was quite unfit [(he said)] to hold the Command of an Army' so Sir J. had withdrawn all troops from him control except the II Corps. Yet Smith-D. stayed on! [He would not resign!] French is to ask Lord Kitchener to find something to do at home. \u2026 He also alluded to Smith-Dorrien's conduct on the retreat, and said he ought to have tried him by Court Martial, because (on the day of [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]) he 'had ordered him to retire at 8 am and he did not attempt to do so [but insisted on fighting in spite of his orders to retire]'.<ref>Sheffield, Gary and Bourne, John (editors) ''Douglas Haig: War Diaries and Letters 1914\u20131918'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005 {{ISBN|0-297-84702-3}} pp. 119\u2013120.[https://archive.org/donate/ <nowiki> [Donate book to Archive.org]</nowiki>]</ref>\n\nAfter French refused permission to retreat, Smith-Dorrien noted (6 May 1915) that the planned counterattack was a complete failure with casualties higher than predicted by GHQ.<ref>Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 203.</ref> Smith-Dorrien's offer to resign his command on 6 May 1915 was ignored, and on that same day French used the 'pessimism' of the withdrawal recommendation as an excuse to sack him from command of Second Army altogether. [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|\"Wully\" Robertson]] is said to have broken the news to him with the words \" 'Orace, yer for 'ome \" (Robertson was a former enlisted man who dropped his aitches), although by another account he might have said \" 'Orace, yer thrown \" (a cavalry metaphor).\n\nThe Official Historian Brigadier [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] later alleged that French had removed Smith-Dorrien as he was senior to Haig and stood in the way of Haig becoming Commander-in-Chief, and that [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] had put the idea in French's mind, but this may be doubtful as their antipathy went back a long way, and French was later (December 1915) replaced by Douglas Haig as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF against his will.<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p204\"/>\n\nSmith-Dorrien was raised to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (14 May 1915) and was briefly appointed GOC [[First Home Army]] (22 June 1915).<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\n===Remainder of the war===\nAfter a period in Britain commanding [[First Army (Home Forces)|First Army]] of [[Central Force]], Smith-Dorrien was appointed GOC East Africa (22 November 1915) to fight the Germans in [[German East Africa]] (present day [[Tanzania]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]]) but pneumonia contracted during the voyage to South Africa prevented him from taking command. His former adversary, [[Jan Smuts]], took on this command. Smith-Dorrien took no significant military part in the rest of the war. He returned to England in January 1916 and on 29 January 1917 was appointed [[lieutenant of the Tower of London]].<ref name=\"Beckett&Corvi 2006, p184\"/>\n\nHe led a campaign in London for moral purity, calling for suppression of \"suggestive or indecent\" media.<ref>Jerry White, ''Zeppelin Nights: London in the First World War'', cited in review by Saul David in ''Evening Standard'', 8 May 2014, page 41.</ref>\n\n===French's memoirs===\nFrench, partly in response to criticism inspired by Smith-Dorrien, later wrote a partial and inaccurate account of the opening of the war in his book ''1914'', which attacked Smith-Dorrien. Smith-Dorrien, as a serving officer, was denied permission to reply in public.\n\nFrench's official despatch after Le Cateau had praised Smith-Dorrien's \"rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity and determination\". In ''1914'' French wrote that this had been written before he knew the full facts, and that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called ''1914'' \"mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too\".<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Horace smith-dorrien grave 1.jpg|thumb|Horace Smith-Dorrien's grave in [[Berkhamsted]]]]\n[[File:Horace smith-dorrien grave 2.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the plate on Smith-Dorrien's gravestone]]\n\nSmith-Dorrien's last position was as [[Governor of Gibraltar]] from 9 July 1918 \u2013 26 May 1923, where he introduced an element of democracy and closed some brothels. According to [[Wyndham Childs]] in the summer of 1918, Smith-Dorrien tried, and nearly succeeded, in uniting the [[Comrades of the Great War]], the [[National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers]], and the [[National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers]] into one organisation. The merger later took place in 1921 to form the [[The Royal British Legion|British Legion]], under the influence of Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]].<!-- Check names against Childs: might be British Federation of Discharged Sailors & Soldiers. The Officers' Association not formed until 1920.-->\n\nHe retired in September 1923, living in Portugal and then England. He devoted much his time to the welfare and remembrance of Great War soldiers. He worked on his memoirs, which were published in 1925. As French was still alive at the time of writing, he still felt unable to rebut ''1914''. Despite his treatment by French, in 1925, he journeyed across Europe to act as a pallbearer at French's funeral,<ref>Neillands 2006, p. 116.</ref> an act appreciated by French's son.\n\nHe played himself in the film ''The Battle of Mons'', released in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/smithdorrien.htm |title=Vintage Video: Sir Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien, 1914 |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/footage/smithdorrien.wmv ''The Battle of Mons''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901205535/http://www.firstworldwar.com/video/footage/smithdorrien.wmv |date=1 September 2006 }} (WMV format, 14 seconds, 377KB).</ref> In June 1925, he unveiled the war memorial in Memorial Avenue, [[Worksop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worksopguardian.co.uk/community/those-were-the-days/when_the_king_came_to_town_1_3787720 |title=When the King came to town |publisher=Worksopguardian.co.uk |date=19 September 2011}}</ref> On 4 August 1930, he unveiled the [[Pozi\u00e8res Memorial]].\n\n==Death==\nSmith-Dorrien died on 12 August 1930 following injuries sustained in a car accident at [[Chippenham]], in [[Wiltshire]]; he was 72 years old.
