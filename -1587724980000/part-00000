Roman copy after a Greek original ([[Vatican Museums]]).]]\nThe image of Hermes evolved and varied along with Greek art and culture. In [[Archaic Greece]] he was usually depicted as a mature man, bearded, and dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. This image remained common on the Hermai, which served as boundary markers, roadside markers, and grave markers, as well as votive offerings.\n\nIn [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]], Hermes was usually depicted as a young, athletic man lacking a beard. When represented as Logios (Greek: \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, speaker), his attitude is consistent with the attribute. [[Phidias]] left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and [[Praxiteles]] another, also well known, showing him with the baby [[Dionysus]] in his arms.\n\nAt all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods, Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all together.<ref name= Smith/><ref>[[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller, Karl Otfried]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/ancientartandit01welcgoog <!-- quote=Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the arch\u00e6ology of art. --> Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the arch\u00e6ology of art]''. B. Quaritch, 1852. pp. 483\u2013488.</ref> Among these objects is a wide-brimmed hat, the [[petasos]], widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun, and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings; sometimes this hat is not present, and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair.\n\nAnother object is the [[caduceus]], a staff with two intertwined snakes, sometimes crowned with a pair of wings and a sphere.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzNfeQSXKfcC|title=Hermes the Thief}}</ref> The caduceus, historically, appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3500 BC. Two snakes coiled around a staff was also a symbol of the god [[Ningishzida]], who, like Hermes, served as a mediator between humans and the divine (specifically, the goddess [[Ishtar]] or the supreme [[Ningirsu]]). In Greece, other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes. It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre.<ref name=Smith/> The caduceus is not to be confused with the [[Rod of Asclepius]], the patron of medicine and son of [[Apollo]], which bears only one snake. The rod of [[Asclepius]] was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States, the caduceus took its place since the 18th century, although this use is declining.  After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nHermes' sandals, called ''p\u00e9dila'' by the Greeks and ''talaria'' by the Romans, were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally, they had no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, wearing a robe or cloak, which had the power to confer invisibility. His weapon was a sword of gold, which killed Argos; lent to Perseus to kill [[Medusa]].<ref name=Smith/>\n\n==Functions==\nHermes began as a god with strong chthonic, or underworld, associations. He was worshipped in ancient times \"the god\nof the road between the Under and the Upper world\", and this function gradually expanded to encompass roads in general, and from there boundaries, travelers, sailors, and commerce.<ref name=transformer/>\n\n===As a chthonic and fertility god===\nBeginning with the earliest records of his worship, Hermes has been understood as a [[chthonic]] deity (heavily associated with the earth and/or underworld).<ref name=transformer/> As a chthonic deity, the worship of Hermes also included an aspect relating to [[Fertility rite|fertility]], with the [[phallus]] being included among his major symbols. The inclusion of phallic imagery associated with Hermes and placed, in the form of ''[[herma]]'', at the entrances to households may reflect a belief in ancient times that Hermes was a symbol of the household's fertility, specifically the potency of the male head of the household in producing children.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nThe association between Hermes and the underworld is related to his function as a god of boundaries (the boundary between life and death), but he is considered a [[psychopomp]], a deity who helps guide souls of the deceased to the afterlife, and his image was commonly depicted on gravestones in classical Greece.<ref name=transformer/>\n\n===As a god of boundaries===\n[[File:Herma Hermes Getty Villa 79.AA.132.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Herm of Hermes. Roman copy from the Hermes Propyleia of Alcamenes, 50\u2013100 AD.]]\n{{main|Herma}}\n{{main|Liminal deity}}\nIn Ancient Greece, Hermes was a phallic god of boundaries. His name, in the form ''herma'', was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones; each traveler added a stone to the pile. In the 6th century BC, [[Hipparchus (tyrant)|Hipparchos]], the son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]], replaced the [[cairn]]s that marked the midway point between each village ''[[deme]]'' at the central ''[[agora]]'' of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of Hermes with a [[beard]]. An erect phallus rose from the base. In the more primitive [[Mount Kyllini]] or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus. \"That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] god is astounding,\" [[Walter Burkert]] remarked.<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], 1985. ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard University Press)</ref> In Athens, herms were placed outside houses, both as a form of protection for the home, a symbol of male fertility, and as a link between the household and its gods with the gods of the wider community.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nIn 415 BC, when the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]], all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized one night.  The Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or from the anti-war faction within Athens itself. [[Socrates]]' pupil [[Alcibiades]] was suspected of involvement, and Socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.<ref>[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 6.27.</ref>\n\n===As a messenger god===\nIn association with his role as a psychopomp and god who is able to easily cross boundaries, Hermes is prominently worshiped as a messenger, often described as the messenger of the gods (since he can convey messages between the divine realms, the underworld, and the world of mortals).<ref name=\"Blackwood\"/> As a messenger and divine herald, he wears winged sandals (or, in Roman art influenced by Etruscan depictions of [[Turms]], a winged cap).<ref name=\"Rochester\">{{cite web |url=http://people.rit.edu/asg1478/iweb/midterm/hermes.html|author=Rochester Institute of Technology |title=Greek Gods |publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525090414/http://people.rit.edu/asg1478/iweb/midterm/hermes.html |archive-date=25 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===As a shepherd god===\n[[File:Hermes crioforo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kriophoros Hermes (which takes the lamb), late-Roman copy of Greek original from the 5th century BC. [[Barracco Museum]], Rome]]\nHermes was known as the patron god of flocks, herds, and shepherds, an attribute possibly tied to his early origin as an aspect of Pan. In [[Boetia]], Hermes was worshiped for having saved the town from a plague by carrying a ram or calf around the city walls. A yearly festival commemorated this event, during which a lamb would be carried around the city by \"the most handsome boy\" and then sacrificed, in order to purify and protect the city from disease, drought, and famine. Numerous depictions of Hermes as a shepherd god carrying a lamb on his shoulders (''Hermes kriophoros'') have been found throughout the Mediterranean world, and it is possible that the iconography of Hermes as \"The Good Shepherd\" had an influence on early Christianity, specifically in the description of Christ as \"the Good Shepard\" in the Gospel of John.<ref name=transformer/><ref name=Shepherd>Freeman, J.

Here, Hermes' name is rendered as ''e\u2010ma\u2010a'' (\u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u03ach\u03b1\u03c2). This name is always recorded alongside those of several goddesses, including Potnija, Posidaeja, Diwja, Hera, Pere, and Ipemedeja, indicating that his worship was strongly connected to theirs. This is a pattern that would continue in later periods, as worship of Hermes almost always took place within temples and sanctuaries primarily dedicated to goddesses, including Hera, Demeter, Hecate, and Despoina.<ref name=transformer>RADULOVI, IFIGENIJA; VUKADINOVI, SNE\u017dANA; SMIRNOVBRKI, ALEKSANDRA \u2013 Hermes the Transformer \u00c1gora.

This region had numerous [[Herma]]i, or pillar-like icons, dedicated to the god marking boundaries, crossroads, and entryways. These were initially stone piles, later pillars made of wood, stone, or bronze, with carved images of Hermes, a phallus, or both.<ref name=transformer/> In the context of these herms, by the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] Hermes had come to be worshiped as the patron god of travelers and sailors.<ref name=transformer/> By the 5th century BC, Hermai were also in common use as grave monuments, emphasizing Hermes' role as a cthonic deity and psychopomp.<ref name=transformer/> This was probably his original function, and he may have been a late inclusion in the Olympic pantheon; Hermes is described as the \"youngest\" Olympian, and some myths, including his theft of Apollo's cows, describe his initial coming into contact with celestial deities. Hermes therefore came to be worshiped as a mediator between celestial and cthonic realms, as well as the one who facilitates interactions between mortals and the divine, often being depicted on libation vessels.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nDue to his mobility and his limenal nature, mediating between opposites (such as merchant/customer<ref name=transformer/>), he was considered the god of [[commerce]] and social intercourse, the wealth brought in business, especially sudden or unexpected enrichment, travel, roads and crossroads, borders and boundary conditions or transient, the changes from the threshold, agreements and contracts, friendship, hospitality, [[sexual intercourse]], games, data, the draw, good luck, the sacrifices and the sacrificial animals, flocks and shepherds and the fertility of land and cattle.<ref name= Smith>Smith, William.

In [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], for example, the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] was identified by Greek speakers as the Egyptian form of Hermes. The two gods were worshiped as one at the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu, a city which became known in Greek as [[Hermopolis]].<ref>Bailey, Donald, \"Classical Architecture\" in Riggs, Christina (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Roman Egypt'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 192.</ref> This led to Hermes gaining the attributes of a god of translation and interpretation, or more generally, a god of knowledge and learning.<ref name=transformer/> This is illustrated by a 3rd-century BC example of a letter sent by the priest Petosiris to King Nechopso, probably written in Alexandria c. 150 BC, stating that Hermes is the teacher of all secret wisdoms, which are accessible by the experience of religious ecstasy.<ref name=\"Marie-Luise von Franz\"/><ref>Jacobi, M.

This lent Hermes one of his most famous later titles, [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (\u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), \"thrice-greatest Hermes\".<ref>Copenhaver, B.

According to St. Augustin, the Latin name \"Mercury\" may be a title derived from \"''medio currens''\", in reference to Hermes' role as a mediator and messenger who moves between worlds.<ref name=transformer/> Mercury became one of the most popular Roman gods, as attested by the numerous shrines and depictions in artwork found in [[Pompeii]].<ref>Beard, Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town at 295\u2013298</ref> In art, the Roman Mercury continued the style of depictions found in earlier representations of both Hermes and Turms, a young, beardless god with winged shoes and/or hat, carrying the caduceus. His role as a god of boundaries, a messenger, and a psychopomp also remained unchanged following his adoption into the roman religion (these attributes were also similar to those in the Etruscan's worship of Turms).<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Turms \u00e9trusque et la fonction de \u00ab ''minister'' \u00bb de l'Herm\u00e8s italique |pages=171\u2013217 |title=Mercure romain : Le culte public de Mercure et la fonction mercantile \u00e0 Rome de la R\u00e9publique archa\u00efque \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque august\u00e9enne |last=Combet-Farnoux |first=Bernard |date=1980 |publisher=\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans identified the Germanic god [[Odin]] with Mercury, and there is evidence that Germanic peoples who had contact with Roman culture also accepted this identification. Odin and Mercury/Hermes share several attributes in common. For example, both are depicted carrying a staff and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and both are travelers or wanderers. However, the reasons for this interpretation appear to go beyond superficial similarities: Both gods are connected to the dead (Mercury as psychopomp and Odin as lord of the dead in [[Valhalla]]), both were connected to eloquent speech, and both were associated with secret knowledge. The identification of Odin as Mercury was probably also influenced by a previous association of a more Odin-like Celtic god as the \"Celtic Mercurius\".<ref name=odin>Schj\u00f8dt, J. P.

Myth, Materiality, and Lived Religion, 59.</ref>\n\nA further Roman Imperial-era syncretism came in the form of [[Hermanubis]], the result of the identification of Hermes with the Egyptian god of the dead, [[Anubis]]. Hermes and Anubis were both psychopomps, the primary attribute leading to their conflation as the same god. Hermanubis depicted with a human body and a jackal head, holding the caduceus. In addition to his function of guiding souls to the afterlife, Hermanubis represented the Egyptian priesthood the investigation of truth.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[De Iside et Osiride]]'' 61</ref><ref>[[Diodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' i.18, 87</ref>\n\nBeginning around the turn of the 1st century AD, a process began by which, in certain traditions, Hermes became [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] \u2013 that is, interpreted as a historical, mortal figure who had become divine or elevated to godlike status in legend. Numerous books of wisdom and magic (including astrology, theosophy, and alchemy) were attributed to this \"historical\" Hermes, usually identified in his Alexandrian form of Hermes Trismegistus. As a collection, these works are referred to as the ''[[Hermetica]]''.<ref name=eternal>Faivre, A. (1995). ''The Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to Alchemical Magus''. Red Wheel/Weiser.</ref>\n\n===In the Middle Ages===\nThough worship of Hermes had been almost fully suppressed in the Roman Empire following the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I]] in the 4th century AD, Hermes continued to be recognized as a mystical or prophetic figure, though a mortal one, by [[Christianity|Christian]] scholars. Early [[medieval]] Christians such as [[Augustine]] believed that a euhemerised Hermes Trismegistus had been an ancient pagan prophet who predicted the emergence of Christianity in his writings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heiser|first1=James D.|title=Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century|date=2011|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Malone, Tex.|isbn=978-1-4610-9382-4|edition=1st}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Enoch in the Islamic Tradition|last = Jafar|first = Imad|date = 2015|journal = Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity|volume =  XXXVI}}</ref> Some Christian philosophers in the medieval and Renaissance periods believed in the existence of a \"''[[prisca theologia]]''\", a single thread of true theology that could be found uniting all religions.<ref>Yates, F., \"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition\", Routledge, London, 1964, pp 14\u201318 and pp 433\u2013434</ref><ref>Hanegraaff, W.

Though there are a few references in ancient literature to \"numerous\" temples of Hermes,<ref name= Smith/><ref>Lucian of Samosata. The Works of Lucian of Samosata.  BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008. Volume 1, p. 107.</ref> this may be poetic license describing the ubiquitous herms, or other, smaller shrines to Hermes located in the temples of other deities.<ref name=transformer/> One of the oldest places of worship for Hermes was [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia, where some myths say he was born. Tradition holds that his first temple was built by [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]]. From there, the Hermes cult would have been taken to Athens, from which it radiated to the whole of Greece.<ref name= Smith/> In the Roman period, additional temples to Hermes (Mercury) were constructed across the Empire, including several in modern-day Tunisia. Mercury's temple in Rome was situated in the [[Circus Maximus]], between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, and was built in 495 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#21|2:21]]</ref>\n\nIn most places, temples were [[consecrated]] to Hermes in conjunction with Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.\n\nAs a patron of the [[gym]] and [[fighting]], Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].  His statue was held there on an altar dedicated to him and Apollo together.<ref>Johnston, Sarah Iles. Initiation in Myth, Initiation in Practice. IN Dodd, David Brooks & Faraone, Christopher A.

Roman copy after a Greek original ([[Vatican Museums]]).]]\nThe image of Hermes evolved and varied along with Greek art and culture. In [[Archaic Greece]] he was usually depicted as a mature man, bearded, and dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. This image remained common on the Hermai, which served as boundary markers, roadside markers, and grave markers, as well as votive offerings.\n\nIn [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]], Hermes was usually depicted as a young, athletic man lacking a beard. When represented as Logios (Greek: \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, speaker), his attitude is consistent with the attribute. [[Phidias]] left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and [[Praxiteles]] another, also well known, showing him with the baby [[Dionysus]] in his arms.\n\nAt all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods, Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all together.<ref name= Smith/><ref>[[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller, Karl Otfried]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/ancientartandit01welcgoog <!-- quote=Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the arch\u00e6ology of art. --> Ancient art and its remains: or, A manual of the arch\u00e6ology of art]''. B. Quaritch, 1852. pp. 483\u2013488.</ref> Among these objects is a wide-brimmed hat, the [[petasos]], widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun, and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings; sometimes this hat is not present, and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair.\n\nAnother object is the [[caduceus]], a staff with two intertwined snakes, sometimes crowned with a pair of wings and a sphere.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzNfeQSXKfcC|title=Hermes the Thief}}</ref> The caduceus, historically, appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3500 BC. Two snakes coiled around a staff was also a symbol of the god [[Ningishzida]], who, like Hermes, served as a mediator between humans and the divine (specifically, the goddess [[Ishtar]] or the supreme [[Ningirsu]]). In Greece, other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes. It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre.<ref name=Smith/> The caduceus is not to be confused with the [[Rod of Asclepius]], the patron of medicine and son of [[Apollo]], which bears only one snake. The rod of [[Asclepius]] was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States, the caduceus took its place since the 18th century, although this use is declining.  After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nHermes' sandals, called ''p\u00e9dila'' by the Greeks and ''talaria'' by the Romans, were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally, they had no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, wearing a robe or cloak, which had the power to confer invisibility. His weapon was a sword of gold, which killed Argos; lent to Perseus to kill [[Medusa]].<ref name=Smith/>\n\n==Functions==\nHermes began as a god with strong chthonic, or underworld, associations. He was worshipped in ancient times \"the god\nof the road between the Under and the Upper world\", and this function gradually expanded to encompass roads in general, and from there boundaries, travelers, sailors, and commerce.<ref name=transformer/>\n\n===As a chthonic and fertility god===\nBeginning with the earliest records of his worship, Hermes has been understood as a [[chthonic]] deity (heavily associated with the earth and/or underworld).<ref name=transformer/> As a chthonic deity, the worship of Hermes also included an aspect relating to [[Fertility rite|fertility]], with the [[phallus]] being included among his major symbols. The inclusion of phallic imagery associated with Hermes and placed, in the form of ''[[herma]]'', at the entrances to households may reflect a belief in ancient times that Hermes was a symbol of the household's fertility, specifically the potency of the male head of the household in producing children.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nThe association between Hermes and the underworld is related to his function as a god of boundaries (the boundary between life and death), but he is considered a [[psychopomp]], a deity who helps guide souls of the deceased to the afterlife, and his image was commonly depicted on gravestones in classical Greece.<ref name=transformer/>\n\n===As a god of boundaries===\n[[File:Herma Hermes Getty Villa 79.AA.132.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Herm of Hermes. Roman copy from the Hermes Propyleia of Alcamenes, 50\u2013100 AD.]]\n{{main|Herma}}\n{{main|Liminal deity}}\nIn Ancient Greece, Hermes was a phallic god of boundaries. His name, in the form ''herma'', was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones; each traveler added a stone to the pile. In the 6th century BC, [[Hipparchus (tyrant)|Hipparchos]], the son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]], replaced the [[cairn]]s that marked the midway point between each village ''[[deme]]'' at the central ''[[agora]]'' of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of Hermes with a [[beard]]. An erect phallus rose from the base. In the more primitive [[Mount Kyllini]] or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus. \"That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] god is astounding,\" [[Walter Burkert]] remarked.<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], 1985. ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard University Press)</ref> In Athens, herms were placed outside houses, both as a form of protection for the home, a symbol of male fertility, and as a link between the household and its gods with the gods of the wider community.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nIn 415 BC, when the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]], all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized one night.  The Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or from the anti-war faction within Athens itself. [[Socrates]]' pupil [[Alcibiades]] was suspected of involvement, and Socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.<ref>[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 6.27.</ref>\n\n===As a messenger god===\nIn association with his role as a psychopomp and god who is able to easily cross boundaries, Hermes is prominently worshiped as a messenger, often described as the messenger of the gods (since he can convey messages between the divine realms, the underworld, and the world of mortals).<ref name=\"Blackwood\"/> As a messenger and divine herald, he wears winged sandals (or, in Roman art influenced by Etruscan depictions of [[Turms]], a winged cap).<ref name=\"Rochester\">{{cite web |url=http://people.rit.edu/asg1478/iweb/midterm/hermes.html|author=Rochester Institute of Technology |title=Greek Gods |publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525090414/http://people.rit.edu/asg1478/iweb/midterm/hermes.html |archive-date=25 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===As a shepherd god===\n[[File:Hermes crioforo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kriophoros Hermes (which takes the lamb), late-Roman copy of Greek original from the 5th century BC. [[Barracco Museum]], Rome]]\nHermes was known as the patron god of flocks, herds, and shepherds, an attribute possibly tied to his early origin as an aspect of Pan. In [[Boetia]], Hermes was worshiped for having saved the town from a plague by carrying a ram or calf around the city walls. A yearly festival commemorated this event, during which a lamb would be carried around the city by \"the most handsome boy\" and then sacrificed, in order to purify and protect the city from disease, drought, and famine. Numerous depictions of Hermes as a shepherd god carrying a lamb on his shoulders (''Hermes kriophoros'') have been found throughout the Mediterranean world, and it is possible that the iconography of Hermes as \"The Good Shepherd\" had an influence on early Christianity, specifically in the description of Christ as \"the Good Shepard\" in the Gospel of John.<ref name=transformer/><ref name=Shepherd>Freeman, J.

Here, Hermes' name is rendered as ''e\u2010ma\u2010a'' (\u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u03ach\u03b1\u03c2). This name is always recorded alongside those of several goddesses, including Potnija, Posidaeja, Diwja, Hera, Pere, and Ipemedeja, indicating that his worship was strongly connected to theirs. This is a pattern that would continue in later periods, as worship of Hermes almost always took place within temples and sanctuaries primarily dedicated to goddesses, including Hera, Demeter, Hecate, and Despoina.<ref name=transformer>RADULOVI, IFIGENIJA; VUKADINOVI, SNE\u017dANA; SMIRNOVBRKI, ALEKSANDRA \u2013 Hermes the Transformer \u00c1gora.

This region had numerous [[Herma]]i, or pillar-like icons, dedicated to the god marking boundaries, crossroads, and entryways. These were initially stone piles, later pillars made of wood, stone, or bronze, with carved images of Hermes, a phallus, or both.<ref name=transformer/> In the context of these herms, by the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] Hermes had come to be worshiped as the patron god of travelers and sailors.<ref name=transformer/> By the 5th century BC, Hermai were also in common use as grave monuments, emphasizing Hermes' role as a cthonic deity and psychopomp.<ref name=transformer/> This was probably his original function, and he may have been a late inclusion in the Olympic pantheon; Hermes is described as the \"youngest\" Olympian, and some myths, including his theft of Apollo's cows, describe his initial coming into contact with celestial deities. Hermes therefore came to be worshiped as a mediator between celestial and cthonic realms, as well as the one who facilitates interactions between mortals and the divine, often being depicted on libation vessels.<ref name=transformer/>\n\nDue to his mobility and his limenal nature, mediating between opposites (such as merchant/customer<ref name=transformer/>), he was considered the god of [[commerce]] and social intercourse, the wealth brought in business, especially sudden or unexpected enrichment, travel, roads and crossroads, borders and boundary conditions or transient, the changes from the threshold, agreements and contracts, friendship, hospitality, [[sexual intercourse]], games, data, the draw, good luck, the sacrifices and the sacrificial animals, flocks and shepherds and the fertility of land and cattle.<ref name= Smith>Smith, William.

In this context, Hermes became a god associated with the Athenian empire and its expansion, and of democracy itself, as well as all of those closely associated with it, from the sailors in the navy, to the merchants who drove the economy.<ref name=transformer/> A section of the agora in Athens became known as the Hermai, because it was filled with a large number of herms, placed there as votive offerings by merchants and others who wished to commemorate a personal success in commerce or other public affair. The Hermai was probably destroyed in the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87\u201386 BC)]].<ref name=transformer/>\n\n===In the Hellenistic period===\n[[Image:Hermes-louvre3.jpg|thumb|225px|right|''[[Hermes Fastening his Sandal]]'', early Imperial Roman marble copy of a [[Lysippus|Lysippan]] bronze ([[Louvre Museum]])]]\nAs Greek culture and influence spread following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], a period of syncretism or ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' saw many traditional Greek deities identified with foreign counterparts. In [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], for example, the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] was identified by Greek speakers as the Egyptian form of Hermes. The two gods were worshiped as one at the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu, a city which became known in Greek as [[Hermopolis]].<ref>Bailey, Donald, \"Classical Architecture\" in Riggs, Christina (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Roman Egypt'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 192.</ref> This led to Hermes gaining the attributes of a god of translation and interpretation, or more generally, a god of knowledge and learning.<ref name=transformer/> This is illustrated by a 3rd-century BC example of a letter sent by the priest Petosiris to King Nechopso, probably written in Alexandria c. 150 BC, stating that Hermes is the teacher of all secret wisdoms, which are accessible by the experience of religious ecstasy.<ref name=\"Marie-Luise von Franz\"/><ref>Jacobi, M.

This lent Hermes one of his most famous later titles, [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (\u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), \"thrice-greatest Hermes\".<ref>Copenhaver, B. P., \"Hermetica\", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992, p xiv.</ref> The figure of Hermes Trismegistus would later absorb a variety of other esoteric wisdom traditions and become a major component of [[Hermeticism]], [[alchemy]], and related traditions.<ref name=fowden>Fowden, G., \"The Egyptian Hermes\", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987, p 216</ref>\n\n===In the Roman period===\nAs early as the 4th century BC, Romans had adopted Hermes into their own religion, combining his attributes and worship with the earlier Etruscan god Turms under the name [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. According to St. Augustin, the Latin name \"Mercury\" may be a title derived from \"''medio currens''\", in reference to Hermes' role as a mediator and messenger who moves between worlds.<ref name=transformer/> Mercury became one of the most popular Roman gods, as attested by the numerous shrines and depictions in artwork found in [[Pompeii]].<ref>Beard, Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town at 295\u2013298</ref> In art, the Roman Mercury continued the style of depictions found in earlier representations of both Hermes and Turms, a young, beardless god with winged shoes and/or hat, carrying the caduceus. His role as a god of boundaries, a messenger, and a psychopomp also remained unchanged following his adoption into the roman religion (these attributes were also similar to those in the Etruscan's worship of Turms).<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Turms \u00e9trusque et la fonction de \u00ab ''minister'' \u00bb de l'Herm\u00e8s italique |pages=171\u2013217 |title=Mercure romain : Le culte public de Mercure et la fonction mercantile \u00e0 Rome de la R\u00e9publique archa\u00efque \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque august\u00e9enne |last=Combet-Farnoux |first=Bernard |date=1980 |publisher=\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans identified the Germanic god [[Odin]] with Mercury, and there is evidence that Germanic peoples who had contact with Roman culture also accepted this identification. Odin and Mercury/Hermes share several attributes in common. For example, both are depicted carrying a staff and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and both are travelers or wanderers. However, the reasons for this interpretation appear to go beyond superficial similarities: Both gods are connected to the dead (Mercury as psychopomp and Odin as lord of the dead in [[Valhalla]]), both were connected to eloquent speech, and both were associated with secret knowledge. The identification of Odin as Mercury was probably also influenced by a previous association of a more Odin-like Celtic god as the \"Celtic Mercurius\".<ref name=odin>Schj\u00f8dt, J. P. Mercury\u2013Wotan\u2013\u00d3\u00f0inn: One or Many?. Myth, Materiality, and Lived Religion, 59.</ref>\n\nA further Roman Imperial-era syncretism came in the form of [[Hermanubis]], the result of the identification of Hermes with the Egyptian god of the dead, [[Anubis]]. Hermes and Anubis were both psychopomps, the primary attribute leading to their conflation as the same god. Hermanubis depicted with a human body and a jackal head, holding the caduceus. In addition to his function of guiding souls to the afterlife, Hermanubis represented the Egyptian priesthood the investigation of truth.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[De Iside et Osiride]]'' 61</ref><ref>[[Diodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' i.18, 87</ref>\n\nBeginning around the turn of the 1st century AD, a process began by which, in certain traditions, Hermes became [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] \u2013 that is, interpreted as a historical, mortal figure who had become divine or elevated to godlike status in legend. Numerous books of wisdom and magic (including astrology, theosophy, and alchemy) were attributed to this \"historical\" Hermes, usually identified in his Alexandrian form of Hermes Trismegistus. As a collection, these works are referred to as the ''[[Hermetica]]''.<ref name=eternal>Faivre, A. (1995). ''The Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to Alchemical Magus''. Red Wheel/Weiser.</ref>\n\n===In the Middle Ages===\nThough worship of Hermes had been almost fully suppressed in the Roman Empire following the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I]] in the 4th century AD, Hermes continued to be recognized as a mystical or prophetic figure, though a mortal one, by [[Christianity|Christian]] scholars. Early [[medieval]] Christians such as [[Augustine]] believed that a euhemerised Hermes Trismegistus had been an ancient pagan prophet who predicted the emergence of Christianity in his writings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heiser|first1=James D.|title=Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century|date=2011|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Malone, Tex.|isbn=978-1-4610-9382-4|edition=1st}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Enoch in the Islamic Tradition|last = Jafar|first = Imad|date = 2015|journal = Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity|volume =  XXXVI}}</ref> Some Christian philosophers in the medieval and Renaissance periods believed in the existence of a \"''[[prisca theologia]]''\", a single thread of true theology that could be found uniting all religions.<ref>Yates, F., \"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition\", Routledge, London, 1964, pp 14\u201318 and pp 433\u2013434</ref><ref>Hanegraaff, W.

Though there are a few references in ancient literature to \"numerous\" temples of Hermes,<ref name= Smith/><ref>Lucian of Samosata. The Works of Lucian of Samosata.  BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008. Volume 1, p. 107.</ref> this may be poetic license describing the ubiquitous herms, or other, smaller shrines to Hermes located in the temples of other deities.<ref name=transformer/> One of the oldest places of worship for Hermes was [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia, where some myths say he was born. Tradition holds that his first temple was built by [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]]. From there, the Hermes cult would have been taken to Athens, from which it radiated to the whole of Greece.<ref name= Smith/> In the Roman period, additional temples to Hermes (Mercury) were constructed across the Empire, including several in modern-day Tunisia. Mercury's temple in Rome was situated in the [[Circus Maximus]], between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, and was built in 495 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#21|2:21]]</ref>\n\nIn most places, temples were [[consecrated]] to Hermes in conjunction with Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.\n\nAs a patron of the [[gym]] and [[fighting]], Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].  His statue was held there on an altar dedicated to him and Apollo together.<ref>Johnston, Sarah Iles. Initiation in Myth, Initiation in Practice. IN Dodd, David Brooks & Faraone, Christopher A.

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\" ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011</ref> \"by the early 5th cent. the word had become a technical term in Christian asceticism, signifying a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray.\" Not only monks and theologians spoke of the vice but it appears in the writings of laymen as well. It appears in Dante's Divine Comedy not only as a sin to be punished in the damned but as the sin that leads Dante to the edge of Hell to begin with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.westmont.edu/bstrine/styleable/essay/infernoacedia.html|title=The Inferno: Dante's Sin of Acedia|website=homepage.westmont.edu|accessdate=2020-04-19}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. / Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=2020-04-19}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted. Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\".

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''.

It appears in Dante's Divine Comedy not only as a sin to be punished in the damned but as the sin that leads Dante to the edge of Hell to begin with<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.westmont.edu/bstrine/styleable/essay/infernoacedia.html|title=The Inferno: Dante's Sin of Acedia|website=homepage.westmont.edu|accessdate=2020-04-19}}</ref>. [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire  troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. /  Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of  Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=2020-04-19}}</ref>.</blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>.\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

[[Simha Arom]] says that the level of polyphonic complexity of Pygmy music was reached in Europe in the 14th century, yet Pygmy culture is unwritten and ancient, some Pygmy groups being the first known cultures in some areas of Africa.<ref>''African Rhythms'' (2003).

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all. As a result of pressure from [[UNICEF]] and human-rights activists, a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people is awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament.<ref name=slavery>{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228160138/http://newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archivedate=2009-02-28 |title=Congo's Pygmies live as slaves |work=The News & Observer |first=Katie |last=Thomas |date=March 12, 2007}}\n{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/world/as-the-world-intrudes-pygmies-feel-endangered.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=As the World Intrudes, Pygmies Feel Endangered |author=Kristof, Nicholas D. |date=June 16, 1997 |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], during the [[Ituri Conflict]], Ugandan backed rebel groups were accused by the UN of [[Slavery in Africa|enslaving]] Mbutis to prospect for minerals and forage for forest food, with those returning empty handed being killed and [[human cannibalism|eaten]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/09/congo.jamesastill|title=Congo rebels are eating pygmies, UN says|author=James Astill|work=The Guardian|date=8 January 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of Mbuti pygmies, told the UN's Indigenous People's Forum that during the [[Second Congo War|Congo Civil War]], his people were hunted down and eaten as though they were game animals.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.

One study found that the HIV prevalence among the Baka pygmies in eastern Cameroon went from 0.7 percent in 1993 to 4 percent in 2003.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\"/>\n\n=== Deforestation ===\nRaja James Sheshardi of the American University conducted a case study on the Pygmies of Africa and concluded that deforestation has greatly affected their everyday lives. Pygmy culture is threatened today by the forces of political and economic change. In recent times, this has manifested itself into an open conflict over the resources of the tropical rain-forest; it is a conflict that the Pygmy are losing.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}{{year needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ethnic groups of Africa]]\n*[[Peopling of Africa]]\n*[[Khoi-San]]\n*[[Congoid]]\n*[[Capoid]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|African Pygmies}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070834/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=55341 Kiss of Life for DR Congo Pygmies by Badylon Kawanda Bakiman]\n*[http://www.pygmies.org/ African Pygmies: Hunter-Gatherer Peoples of Central Africa]\n*[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The-Pygmies-Plight.html?c=y&page=1 The Pygmies' Plight] Smithsonian Magazine, December 2008 by Paul Raffaele\n*[http://www.survival-international.org/tribes.php?tribe_id=35 Survival International: Pygmies]\n*[http://www.pygmysurvival.org/ Pygmy Survival Alliance]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305231312/http://www.wimp.com/bridgebuilding/ Undated footage of Pygmy tribe constructing a vine bridge]\n\n[[Category:African Pygmies| ]]\n", "name_user": "Crywalt", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Pygmies"}
