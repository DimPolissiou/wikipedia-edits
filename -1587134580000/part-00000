Di St\u00e9fano grew up playing street football, in oratories and in neighbourhood teams such as the [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]] \"Unidos y Venceremos\", and the Im\u00e1n of the Flores district. People already had noticed his talent. But, in 1940 his family moves to the countryside and Di St\u00e9fano started working with his father and playing football with his brother Tulio in the [[Club Social y Deportivo Uni\u00f3 Progresista]] until 1943, when the family returned to Buenos Aires.  \n\n==Club career==\n\n===River Plate===\n[[File:Di-stefano.jpg|thumb|upright|Di St\u00e9fano with River Plate in 1940.]]\n\nIn 1944 his father wrote a letter of recommendations to [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and the club sent a reply telegram to invite him to  an audition with the youth team. Di St\u00e9fano impressed on the trial and joined the squad of the second team of River Plate, the club his family supported.  The next year he became part of the first team  which was called [[La M\u00e1quina]] due to their unprecedented success and it was consisted of players like the legendary [[Adolfo Pedernera|Pedernera]], [[\u00c1ngel Labruna|Labruna]] [[Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz|Mu\u00f1oz]], and [[Felix Loustau|Loustau]]. One of the main stars of the team [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno|Moreno]] had just left for the Mexican [[Real Club Espa\u00f1a]] and it seemed like a good opportunity for the young Di St\u00e9fano to fight for a place in the first squad. Di St\u00e9fano, whose idol was Paraguayan [[Arsenio Erico]] , the striker of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]], learned from the qualities of the big stars especially [[Adolfo Pedernera|Pedernera]]. His coach, and first mentor [[Carlos Peucelle]], taught him how to play the ball low and soon he made his first team debut in 1945, at the age of 19: on July 15 of that year he debuted against [[Hurac\u00e1n]] in 2\u20131 defeat for the twelfth day of the [[1945 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1945 Argentine championship]]. That was the only game Di St\u00e9fano played in that year, but at the end of the season he won his first title as River Plater won the championship, leaving [[Boca Juniors]] four points behind.\n\n===Loaned to Hurac\u00e1n===\nDuring the only match Di St\u00e9fano played in the previous season, the president of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] was impressed by his potential; Di St\u00e9fano agreed, as he realised his chances of making the first team for River Plate were limited. Hurac\u00e1n and Argentina legend [[Herminio Masantonio]] had just retired and the club needed a replacement forward.<br>\nFormer Argentine striker and World Cup top scorer [[Guillermo St\u00e1bile]], the Hurac\u00e1n and Argentine national team coach at the time, gave Di St\u00e9fano his first real opportunities in the [[1946 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1946 season]]. He scored the first two goals of his career in a 3\u20131 victory against [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes (LP)]]. He later scored against his former team River Plate, netting the fastest goal in the history of the Argentine championship, after about ten seconds of play. He would score 10 goals in 25 appearances for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Huracan]], teaming up perfectly with [[Norberto Doroteo M\u00e9ndez|Norberto M\u00e9ndez]] who would later become the all-time top scorer in [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Hurac\u00e1n tried to sign Di St\u00e9fano permanently at the end of a successful eighth-placed season, but could not afford the 90.000 pesos River Plate asked for the transfer.\n\n===Return to River Plate 1947-1949===\n[[File:La Maquina 1947.jpg|thumb|right|Di St\u00e9fano with [[La Maquina]] in 1947.]]\nUpon his return to River Plate, Di St\u00e9fano became integral part of [[La M\u00e1quina]] taking on the role of the departing [[Adolfo Pedernera]] who had signed for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Atlanta]]. [[Carlos Peucelle]] initially put Di St\u00e9fano on the flank, a position in which Di St\u00e9fano struggled to play; in a game against Atlanta of Pedernera, Peucelle decided to place him as a center forward and River eventually won by 6\u20131. Soon, Di St\u00e9fano imposed himself as the center forward and his teammates adapted to his game. This is when he obtained the nickname of ''Saeta Rubia'', coined by journalist Roberto Neuberger. Though he had to leave the team for some time due to the compulsory conscription, Di St\u00e9fano contributed significantly to the victory of the [[1947 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], and became the top scorer of the league with 27 goals.<br>\nThe victory in the league gave River Plate the right to represent Argentina in the [[Copa Aldao]] against the champions of Uruguay [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional Montevideo]] who featured great player like goalkeeper [[Anibal Paz]] and [[Walter Taibo]] in a two-nation club competition that tracked origins to 1913 and for many it was considered as the precursor to the [[Copa Libertadores]]. On November 1947, River beat Nacional 4\u20133 with Di St\u00e9fano scoring one goal in Montevideo and four days later, Di St\u00e9fano celebrated his first international club trophy with a 3\u20131 victory in Buenos Aires. <br>\nIn February 1948, champions River Plate participated in the inaugural [[South American Championship of Champions]] in Santiago facing the other South American champions finishing second behind [[Vasco da Gama]] and Di St\u00e9fano scored 4 goals in 6 games. During the Argentinian championship of 1948, the Football Association suspended the tournament for a short time due to the protests of the players led by [[Adolfo Pedernera]] and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and materialised with a player's strike in a bid to gain a professional footballer's status and rights. Despite that upheaval Di St\u00e9fano scored 13 goals in 23 games and River Plate finished third. The strike last for 8 months until 1949 and it eventually meant the departure of the best Argentine footballers towards other championships, in particular towards that Colombian, which was one of the  lucrative in the world at the time. In one of his last games in Argentina, on 31 July 1949, Di St\u00e9fano played in the role of goalkeeper, replacing the owner [[Amadeo Carrizo]] for twenty minutes and keeping the clean sheet in a derby won against [[Boca Juniors]].\n\n===Millonarios 1949-1953===\nAfter the [[Superga air disaster]], in May 1949, a friendly match between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Grande Torino]] was played and Di St\u00e9fano was promised to the Granata. However the Argentine forward was soon after contacted by [[Adolfo Pedernera]] who had already agreed terms with the Colombian Bogota-based club of [[Millonarios F.C.]]. On 9 August 1949, after another one of his teammates, [[N\u00e9stor Rossi]] signed for the Colombian club without the president of River Plate receiving any compensation for the transfer of the players as the Colombian FA was still not affiliated with FIFA, Di St\u00e9fano signed for the Colombians. Millonarios  who anyway could not afford not to pay the transfer fees, offered him a salary clearly higher than that received at River Plate, and the Argentine forward started a new chapter in his career in Colombia, in period called [[El Dorado (Colombian football)|El Dorado]]. Many international stars like the Hungarians [[B\u00e9la S\u00e1rosi]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u0151ke]], Lithuanian [[Vytautas Kri\u0161\u010di\u016bnas]], the Argentines [[Ren\u00e9 Pontoni]], [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]], English [[Charlie Mitten]] from [[Manchester United]] for 5.000 pounds a year, [[Neil Franklin]] from [[Stoke City]], French-Hungarian [[Ferenc Nyers]], Italian [[Luigi Di Franco]], the Brazilian legend [[Heleno de Freitas]] and others had joined the league after legendary Perdenera first signed. The Colombian League became at the time the best in the world and with the highest salaries.\n\nThe Colombian league had turned professional in 1948 started the [[El Dorado (Colombian football)|El Dorado period]] on 25 April 1949. Di St\u00e9fano, Perdenera and Nestor Rossi who joined Millonarios in the summer formed the famous trio called the [[Ballet Azul]] and helped them win their first title ever beating [[Deportivo Cali]] in the [[1949 Campeonato Profesional| 1949 final]], with Di St\u00e9fano scoring 16 goals in 14 games. Di St\u00e9fano scored 23 goals in 29 games the following [[1950 Campeonato Profesional| 1950 season]], but Millonarios  finished 2 points behind eventual champions [[Once Caldas|Deportes Caldas]]. Di St\u00e9fano, who kept in excellent condition, excelled during his games and led Millonarios to the other second title in [[1951 Campeonato Profesional|1951]] leaving runners-up [[Boca Juniors de Cali]] by 11 points behind on the final table and scoring 32 goals in 34 games, more than any other player in the league. Millonarios would go on to lose the [[Copa Colombia]] of 1951 (played in 1952) to [[Boca Juniors de Cali]].\n\nThe [[1952 Campeonato Profesional|1952 league]] had the same outcome: Milionarios overtook [[Boca Juniors de Cali]], won their third title and Di St\u00e9fano was once again top-scorer with 19 goals. In October 1952, Di St\u00e9fano also led Millonarios to the final of [[Copa Colombia]] after beating Deportivo C\u00facuta by 2\u20131. The final would be played in May 1953, but with Di St\u00e9fano already in Argentina.\n\nIn October 1951 [[Divisi\u00f3n Mayor del F\u00fatbol Profesional Colombiano|DIMAYOR]] had agreed the Pacto de Lima with the FIFA, with the requirement that the foreign players would return to their countries after October 1954. He totally scored 267 goals in 292 goals for Milionarios and is considered still as one of the best footballers the history of the Colombian League.\n\n===The disputed transfer to Spain===\n\nIn March 1952, [[Real Madrid]] organized a friendly tournament in the Spanish capital, at its newly constructed home ground, [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] was invited to participate in Real Madrid's  50th-anniversary tournament. The tournament was called Bodas de Oro, but once Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu heard about the new powerhouse in South America, Millonarios cancelled the invitation to River Plate and invited the Colombians as the representative of South America. The Colombians participated in the tournament and won it, after drawing 2\u20132 with Swedish champions [[IFK Norrkoping]] and overcoming the Los Blancos who were managed by Argentine legend [[Hector Scarone]] by 4\u20132 with a brace from ''Saeta Rubia'' under the presence of President [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]], who arrived to the stadium to observe [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. Instead, Bernab\u00e9u asked Millonarios about Di St\u00e9fano and a deal was struck between him and Millonarios owner Alfonso Senor Quevedo, both sympathetic to the conservative regimes of the time in Spain and Colombia. Millonarios would start a global tour and spearheaded by Di St\u00e9fano, they would beat Hungary and world champions Uruguay.\n\nSoon, after Millonarios' return to Colombia, the Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with  River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held the his card for the transfer of Di St\u00e9fano in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian liras (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). That was when a head-to-head match between the two Spanish rivals for his purchase was born. In Christmas 1952, Di St\u00e9fano still contracted with Millonarios, returned briefly to Buenos Aires, where he was even making plans to abandon football and start a business as Argentine league was still not professional.  \n\nFIFA expressed a favourable attitude towards Barcelona about the issue, sanctioning the contract of the player to the blaugrana. However the Spanish Football Association blocked the transfer. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation, linked to Francisco Franco, as mediator. Calero decided to let Real Madrid play the seasons 1953-1954 and in 1955-1956 and in Barcelona the years 1954-1955 and 1956\u20131957. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president who was forced to resign in September 1953. \n\nAs his first few games were unimpressive, Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to the Blancos signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, 16,000 of salary to the Argentine with doubled bonus compared to his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club. This fact contributed greatly to the rivalry with the Catalan club. Before the arrival of Di St\u00e9fano, the club of the Spanish capital was neither the largest club in the country, nor the largest in the city: Real Madrid did not have a great football tradition, in fact had won only two championships, while Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were six and four respectively.\n\n===Real Madrid: The first European triumph===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|180px|Di St\u00e9fano scoring a goal for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] where he won 15 official titles]]\n\nA 27-year-old Di St\u00e9fano arrived at Real Madrid on 22 September 1953, after seven months of inactivity, and made his debut with the white jersey in October 1953 in a cl\u00e1sico against champions Barcelona, won 5\u20130 with a hat trick by Di St\u00e9fano. Real Madrid had an average team and had not won the title in 20 years. In his first months in Madrid, the Argentine champion did not adapt to European football, but imposed his own style, playing all around the field with speed and the ball low on the ground. At the first season with Real Madrid, Di St\u00e9fano became the top scorer of the [[1953\u201354 La Liga]] with 27 goals in 28 appearances, contributing significantly to the title victory: the Blancos managed to win the Spanish championship after two decades.\n\nThe following year, Real Madrid acquired Argentine [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]] from the [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional Montevideo]], a signing recommended by Di St\u00e9fano, for the attack of the Merengues. The club won another League in [[1954\u201355 La Liga|1955]] leaving Barcelona again in the second place of the table. Di St\u00e9fano scored 25 goals, finishing behind only [[Juan Arza]] (28) among the scorers of the Spanish league. On 26 June 1955, the Spanish club won their first ever [[Latin Cup]] beating [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]]'s [[Stade de Reims]] in the final, in Paris by 2\u20130.  \n\nThe second consecutive Spanish title allowed Real Madrid to be the first representative of Spain in the inaugural [[UEFA Champions League|Champions Cup]] in its first edition in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|1955-1956 season]]. Di St\u00e9fano made his Champions Cup debut against [[Servette]] in a 2\u20130 away win. In the league he was again the top scorer (24 goals), but despite that, [[Athletic Bilbao]] won the tournament ahead of Bar\u00e7a and Real. In the Champions Cup the team made their way eliminating the Swiss and later [[Partizan Belgrade]], after a suffering a 3\u20130 defeat in Yugoslavia. With the guidance of Di St\u00e9fano they had an easy 4\u20130 victory in Madrid in the first leg, in December 1956. Real Madrid team flew to Belgrade and, despite the snowstorm that had hit the city in the previous days, the president Bernab\u00e9u agreed for the match not to be postponed. Unlike the Spaniards, the Partizan players did not suffer on the terrain, took the lead and dominated the game. A penalty is awarded to Real Madrid, but [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]] slipped when kicking and missed it. In the final minutes with the Serbians up by 3\u20130, Di St\u00e9fano helped defending and Real qualified despite a clear defeat.  The Blancos eliminated Milan in the semi-finals [64] and entered the final in Paris against [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]]'s [[Stade de Reims]]. Real Madrid suffered in the first half, but Di St\u00e9fano lifted his teammates to come back and win the trophy by 4\u20133. At the end of the year, on 18 December 1956, the [[1956 Ballon d'Or|Ballon s'Or]] was born and Di St\u00e9fano missed the award for just 3 votes to [[Stanley Matthews]].\n\n===Naturalisation and the built of an empire===\n[[File:DiStefanoPuskas.jpg|thumb|upright|Di St\u00e9fano with his friend [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]]]]\n\nIn the summer of 1956, Real Madrid signed [[Raymond Kopa]] from the Stade de Reims. The French forward could not feature in the games due to the limit of foreigners in La Liga and had to wait for the Spanish naturalisation of Di St\u00e8fano, who became a Spanish citizen in October 1956.<br>\nThe season started early with the participation of Real Madrid in the [[1956 Small Club World Cup]] in Caracas, Venezuela as European champions. The Spaniards faced [[Vasco da Gama]], [[AS Roma]] and FC Porto playing against players like World Cup winner[[Alcides Ghiggia]] and [[Vav\u00e1]]. Real won the trophy with 3 wins and Di St\u00e9fano finished as top scorer of the tournament with 4 goals (same as [[Vav\u00e1]]).<br>\nAs Real Madrid did not win the title in the previous season, president [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u]], who also served as the vice-president of the competition, came up with the idea that the Champions Cup winner had the right to register for the next edition to defend the victory even if it had lost the championship. Consequently, Real participated in the [[1956\u201357 European Cup|1956-1957 season]], eliminating [[Rapid Vienna]], Nice and [[Manchester United]] in the semifinals and beating [[Fiorentina]] by 2\u20130 in the final, in Madrid. During the season, Real also asserted itself in the last edition of the [[Latin Cup]] , overcoming [[Benfica]] 1\u20130 in the final with a decisive goal by Di St\u00e9fano and at the end of the year, he won the [[1957 Ballon d'Or]]. From the twenty-third day of the 1956-1957 championship, Real Madrid started a series of consecutive victorious home results that ended only in 1966, at the twenty-fifth round of the Liga, after 121 matches. The Blancos attack was one of the best in history and boasted Di St\u00e9fano, [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]], [[Francisco Gento]] and Kopa. Real won the [[1956\u201357 La Liga|1957 championship]] and Di St\u00e9fano was again the scorer of the Liga with 31 goals.\n\nIn the following season, Real Madrid is further strengthened with the arrival of Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Santamaria]] in defense. Di St\u00e9fano scored 19 goals and won the top scorer award, obtaining the [[1957\u201358 La Liga|1958 title]] at the expense of [[Atletico Madrid]]. In the quarter-finals of the [[1957\u201358 European Cup|1958 Champions Cup]], Real Madrid faced [[Sevilla FC]] humiliating their  opponents in the first leg in Madrid with an 8-0 where he scored four goals. On their return, in Seville, Di St\u00e9fano was greeted by the insulting choruses of opposing fans and Real were held on 2\u20132. In the semifinals, Di St\u00e8fano contributed to the success against Hungarian Vasas and the team reached the final against [[Juan Alberto Schiaffino]]'s Milan. Real Madrid won the final with a 3\u20132 in comeback and the Argentinian all-around player finished the tournament as the top scorer with 10 goals.\n\nBut the season finished with the loss of the [[1958 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|1958 General\u00edsimo Cup]] after they lost 2-0 to [[Athletic Bilbao]]. As a result, [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] signed with Real Madrid in the summer of 1958 to strengthen the squad and Real Madrid would be blessed with one of the most lethal attacking pairs in the history of football. Nevertheless, Real finished second in the [[1958\u201359 La Liga|1959 season]] behind Bar\u00e7a and Don Alfredo with 23 goals he was the best scorer in the league for the fifth and last time, the fourth in a row. \n\nAfter overcoming the rival citizens of [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] after three games in semi-final, Real Madrid won its fourth consecutive [[1958\u201359 European Cup|Champions Cup]] by overtaking again [[Stade de Reims]] again with a score of 2\u20130. During the final, [[Enrique Mateos]], the substitute of Pusk\u00e1s (the Hungarian feared retaliation and decided not to depart with the tam for the final in Stuttgart), took a penalty instead of Di St\u00e9fano and missed it. But, in the beginning of the second half, Di St\u00e9fano scored the second goal and Real Madrid was already a legend throughout the world, the most famous team that everyone wanted to watch.<br>\nOn 16 July, 1959, Real Madrid hosted [[Pele]]'s Santos during their European tour. It was one of the most anticipated games of the tour, given of the reputation that Pele had started building. Di St\u00e9fano's team would beat the Brazilians by 5\u20133. In December, France Football awarded Di St\u00e9fano the [[1959 Ballon d'Or]], which he won ahead of team-mate [[Raymond Kopa]] (who had already returned to [[Stade de Reims]] in the summer of 1959) and [[Juventus]]'s Welsh star [[John Charles]]. Pusk\u00e1s and Gento both finished in the top ten. That was when, during the [[1959-60 La Liga|1959-1960 season]], the Madrilenians signed the Brazilian midfielder [[Didi (footballer, born 1928)|Didi]] who was a World Cup winner, former teammate of [[Garrincha]] and [[Pele]] and the best player of the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. Given that the style of play of the Brazilian was similar to Di St\u00e9fano's, the Brazilian often clashed with the Argentine and there were rumours that he was the one to ask from the club's hierarchy his departure at the summer of 1960. But with Didi in the squad, the Blancos won the fifth consecutive [[1959\u201360 European Cup|Champions Cup]], after eliminating Barcelona in the semifinals, Real Madrid played in the final of the [[Hampden Park]] in Glasgow in front of 135,000 spectators against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. Di St\u00e9fano and Pusk\u00e1s scored three and four goals respectively, in a game considered to be among the finest in the history of football. Di St\u00e9fano scored 8 goals in the [[1959\u201360 European Cup|1960 competition]], finishing second in the scorers' chart won by Pusk\u00e1s. In the [[1959\u201360 La Liga|1960 season]], Real finished equal with Barcelona on the table, but the Catalans were the ones to be awarded the title. Di St\u00e9fano did not win the Pichichi award as Pusk\u00e1s was the topscorer of the league with 25 goals. And they lost [[1960 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]] to [[Atletico Madrid]] by 3\u20131 home on 26 June 1960.\n\n===European decline and the first double===\nThe new season started with the inaugural [[1960 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] and the 0\u20130 draw in the first leg of the final against [[Pe\u00f1arol]] in Montevideo on July 4. But in the second leg, Real beat the Uruguayans by 5\u20130 with Di St\u00e9fano scoring one goal on 4 September 1960. On 13 December 1960, Di St\u00e9fano came fourth on the [[1960 Ballon d'Or]] voting, and for the first time, Real were knocked out of [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1960-61 Champions Cup]], against Barcelona (4-3) after a controversial return match. Real easily won the [[1960-61 La Liga|1961 title]] with a great margin to runners-up [[Atletico Madrid]], but lost again the final of the [[1961 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]], again to Rojiblancos (3-2). Di St\u00e9fano finished the season with 21 goals, second scorer of the league behind Pusk\u00e1s who netted 28 goals.\n\nIn the [[1961-62 La Liga|1961-1962 season]] Di St\u00e9fano won the double for the first time, winning the [[1962 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]] 15 years since the last time after beating Sevilla 2\u20131 with two goals from Pusk\u00e1s to overturn the initial red and white advantage. He finished 6th in the [[1961 Ballon d'Or]] in December and \n. In the [[1961-62 European Cup|1961-62 European season]], Real reached the final of the tournament for the sixth time in its history, after eliminating [[Juventus]] and [[Standard Liegue]]. Real played against [[Eus\u00e9bio]]'s [[Benfica]] and though the Spaniards took the lead twice, in the second half of the game the Lusitanians won the title by 5\u20133, courtesy of [[Eusebio]]. Real lost its first European Cup final and for the first time Di St\u00e9fano did not score in a final (the three goals were scored by Pusk\u00e1s). Nevertheless, he was among the best scorers of the competition for the second time in his career, with 7 goals.\n\nIn the autumn of 1962, the Blancos were knocked out of the [[1962-63 European Cup|European Cup]], against [[Anderlecht]]. But, with Di St\u00e9fano at the age of 37, Real won the [[1962-63 La Liga|1963 title]] over [[Atletico Madrid]], with Pusk\u00e1s finishing as top scorer once again. \n\nThe [[1963-64 La Liga|1963-1964 season ]] was the last of Di St\u00e9fano at Real Madrid. At the beginning of the season, the team had a pre-season tour in Venezuela as the team participated in the [[Small Club World Cup|1963 Small Club World Cup]] against S\u00e3o Paulo and FC Porto. Di St\u00e9fano played on the first match on 20 August but on 24 August 1963, the Argentine champion is kidnapped by the National Liberation Armed Forces of Venezuela in the Potomac hotel in Caracas, and was released by them three days later, unharmed. The incident cost the Los Blancos the trophy as without Di St\u00e9fano they did not manage overcoming S\u00e3o Paulo in the final game.<br>\nThe Blancos clinched the fourth consecutive Liga and reached the final of the [[1963-64 European Cup|1964 European Cup]] after defeating AC Milan in the quarterfinals (4-3). Real Madrid faced [[Helenio Herrera]]'s [[Inter Milan]] in the final. Hours before the final, Di St\u00e9fano explicitly criticized the tactics designed by Real Madrid coach [[Miguel Mu\u00f1oz]] against Italian defender [[Giacinto Facchetti]]. The relationship between Mu\u00f1oz, who had the support of President Bernab\u00e9u, and the Argentine player was already torn. And [[Inter Milan]] won the final by 3\u20131.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Bernab\u00e9u proposes to 38 year-old Di St\u00e9fano to join the technical staff of Real Madrid, and the Argentine declined the offer preferring to continue playing. That final against the Italian was Di St\u00e9fano's the last game as the club decided not to renew his contract.\n\n===Real Madrid career in numbers===\nAlfredo Di St\u00e9fano played for Real Madrid 11 years and won 8 Spanish championships, 1 Spanish Cup, 2 Latin Cups, 5 consecutive Champions Cups (scoring in all the finals he won), 1 Intercontinental Cup, several individual titles including 5 times the League's topscorer. He scored 418 goals in 510 games, of which 308 goals in 396 official matches (49 goals in 59 matches in the Champions Cup), becoming the best scorer in the history of the club, until that record was surpassed several decades later first by [[Ra\u00fal]] and then by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].\n\n===Espanyol===\nAfter the Champions Cup final loss in 1964 against Inter Milan, president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and with Di St\u00e9fano at the age of 38, offered him a place in the Real Madrid coaching staff instead of renewing the player contract. Di St\u00e9fano refused Bernab\u00e9u's proposal and he moved to Real Espanyol. \n\nThe Argentine veteran scored 9 goals in all competitions in his first season, putting an end to a strip of 15 consecutive seasons in which he scored in double figures (18 total). After 14 goals in 60 matches with Espanyol, he retired as a player at 40 in 1966, helping his team avoid relegation on both seasons. At the end of his career and despite what was previously stated, Bernab\u00e9u decided to throw a farewell match against Celtic in Madrid, to honour him for his services.\n\n== International career ==\nDi St\u00e9fano played with three different national teams during his career,<ref name=\"Guardian obit\">{{cite news|title=Alfredo di St\u00e9fano was one of football's greatest trailblazers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/07/alfredo-di-stefano-real-madrid|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> scoring 6 goals in 6 appearances for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and 23 in 31 appearances for [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

He scored his first international goal in that same match, helping Argentina to a 7\u20130 win. Di St\u00e9fano scored five more goals during the championship - including his first hat-trick against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] - as Argentina successfully defended the title they had won [[1946 South American Championship|the previous year]] on home soil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southamerican Championship 1947|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/47safull.html|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref> \n\nDi St\u00e9fano's six games during that tournament would prove to be his only appearances for Argentina. Player strikes, and a dispute with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]], forced Argentina to withdraw from qualifying for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Brazil]], as well as the [[1949 South American Championship|1949]] and [[1953 South American Championship|1953]] South American Championships. By the time [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying]] began for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA]] had banned Di St\u00e9fano from making any further appearances for Argentina, on account of his appearances for the Colombia XI two years earlier - though Argentina once again pulled out of qualifying. \n\n===Colombia===\nAfter moving to Bogota in 1949, during a break in the Colombian League in 1951, friendly matches were organised under the name of combined XI of the Colombian league. Di St\u00e9fano - without ever holding a Colombian passport - made four appearances for the Colombian XI team, which did not appear in the official records of FIFA.\n\n===Spain===\nDi St\u00e9fano was widely loved in Spain, and having been banned from playing for Argentina, it made sense for Di St\u00e9fano to play for Spain. FIFA initially refused to sanction this, but after Di St\u00e9fano acquired Spanish citizenship in 1956, and amid pressure from the Spanish FA, the decision was eventually reversed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alfredo Di Stefano: Real Madrid legend dies at the age of 88 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28197863 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> Di St\u00e9fano consequently made his debut for Spain on 30 January 1957 in a friendly in Madrid, scoring a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win<ref name=eufoot/> to become one of only a few [[List of Spain international footballers born outside Spain|players born outside Spain]] to have appeared for their national team.\n\nThe Spanish team, with a forward line also boasting Barcelona and Real Madrid stars [[Laszlo Kubala]], [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] and [[Francisco Gento]], were favourites to qualify for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], having been drawn into a [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification group]] with Scotland and minnows Switzerland. However, Spain began their campaign with a 2\u20132 draw against the Swiss and then lost to Scotland at [[Hampden Park]] 4\u20132. Spain won both of the reverse fixtures 4\u20131, but the damage had already been done: Scotland beat Switzerland in their final match and qualified at Spain's expense. Di St\u00e9fano, who had played in all four games and scored two goals, missed out yet again.\n\nIn 1961, at the age of 36, Di St\u00e9fano finally qualified for a World Cup, helping Spain qualify for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 edition]] in [[Chile]]. A muscular injury just before the competition prevented him from playing in the finals, but Di St\u00e9fano travelled with the squad anyway, picking the number 6 jersey as his preferred number 9 was taken by Francisco Gento.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1962.html |title=1962 World Cup report by CBC/Radio Canada web site |publisher=Cbc.ca|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref> Spain boasted the likes of [[Jose Santamaria]] and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] - both also naturalised citizens - but with Di St\u00e9fano sidelined, they failed to make it out of the group stage, losing to [[Pele]] and [[Didi (footballer, born 1928)|Didi]]'s Brazil in their final game and finishing at the bottom of their group.

Di St\u00e9fano grew up playing street football, in oratories and in neighbourhood teams such as the [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]] \"Unidos y Venceremos\", and the Im\u00e1n of the Flores district. People already had noticed his talent. But, in 1940 his family moves to the countryside and Di St\u00e9fano started working with his father and playing football with his brother Tulio in the [[Club Social y Deportivo Uni\u00f3 Progresista]] until 1943, when the family returned to Buenos Aires.  \n\n==Club career==\n\n===River Plate===\n[[File:Di-stefano.jpg|thumb|upright|Di St\u00e9fano with River Plate in 1940.]]\n\nIn 1944 his father wrote a letter of recommendations to [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and the club sent a reply telegram to invite him to  an audition with the youth team. Di St\u00e9fano impressed on the trial and joined the squad of the second team of River Plate, the club his family supported.  The next year he became part of the first team  which was called [[La M\u00e1quina]] due to their unprecedented success and it was consisted of players like the legendary [[Adolfo Pedernera|Pedernera]], [[\u00c1ngel Labruna|Labruna]] [[Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz|Mu\u00f1oz]], and [[Felix Loustau|Loustau]]. One of the main stars of the team [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno|Moreno]] had just left for the Mexican [[Real Club Espa\u00f1a]] and it seemed like a good opportunity for the young Di St\u00e9fano to fight for a place in the first squad. Di St\u00e9fano, whose idol was Paraguayan [[Arsenio Erico]] , the striker of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]], learned from the qualities of the big stars especially [[Adolfo Pedernera|Pedernera]]. His coach, and first mentor [[Carlos Peucelle]], taught him how to play the ball low and soon he made his first team debut in 1945, at the age of 19: on July 15 of that year he debuted against [[Hurac\u00e1n]] in 2\u20131 defeat for the twelfth day of the [[1945 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1945 Argentine championship]]. That was the only game Di St\u00e9fano played in that year, but at the end of the season he won his first title as River Plater won the championship, leaving [[Boca Juniors]] four points behind.\n\n===Loaned to Hurac\u00e1n===\nDuring the only match Di St\u00e9fano played in the previous season, the president of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] was impressed by his potential; Di St\u00e9fano agreed, as he realised his chances of making the first team for River Plate were limited. Hurac\u00e1n and Argentina legend [[Herminio Masantonio]] had just retired and the club needed a replacement forward.<br>\nFormer Argentine striker and World Cup top scorer [[Guillermo St\u00e1bile]], the Hurac\u00e1n and Argentine national team coach at the time, gave Di St\u00e9fano his first real opportunities in the [[1946 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1946 season]]. He scored the first two goals of his career in a 3\u20131 victory against [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes (LP)]]. He later scored against his former team River Plate, netting the fastest goal in the history of the Argentine championship, after about ten seconds of play. He would score 10 goals in 25 appearances for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Huracan]], teaming up perfectly with [[Norberto Doroteo M\u00e9ndez|Norberto M\u00e9ndez]] who would later become the all-time top scorer in [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Hurac\u00e1n tried to sign Di St\u00e9fano permanently at the end of a successful eighth-placed season, but could not afford the 90.000 pesos River Plate asked for the transfer.\n\n===Return to River Plate 1947-1949===\n[[File:La Maquina 1947.jpg|thumb|right|Di St\u00e9fano with [[La Maquina]] in 1947.]]\nUpon his return to River Plate, Di St\u00e9fano became integral part of [[La M\u00e1quina]] taking on the role of the departing [[Adolfo Pedernera]] who had signed for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Atlanta]]. [[Carlos Peucelle]] initially put Di St\u00e9fano on the flank, a position in which Di St\u00e9fano struggled to play; in a game against Atlanta of Pedernera, Peucelle decided to place him as a center forward and River eventually won by 6\u20131. Soon, Di St\u00e9fano imposed himself as the center forward and his teammates adapted to his game. This is when he obtained the nickname of ''Saeta Rubia'', coined by journalist Roberto Neuberger. Though he had to leave the team for some time due to the compulsory conscription, Di St\u00e9fano contributed significantly to the victory of the [[1947 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], and became the top scorer of the league with 27 goals.<br>\nThe victory in the league gave River Plate the right to represent Argentina in the [[Copa Aldao]] against the champions of Uruguay [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional Montevideo]] who featured great player like goalkeeper [[Anibal Paz]] and [[Walter Taibo]] in a two-nation club competition that tracked origins to 1913 and for many it was considered as the precursor to the [[Copa Libertadores]]. On November 1947, River beat Nacional 4\u20133 with Di St\u00e9fano scoring one goal in Montevideo and four days later, Di St\u00e9fano celebrated his first international club trophy with a 3\u20131 victory in Buenos Aires. <br>\nIn February 1948, champions River Plate participated in the inaugural [[South American Championship of Champions]] in Santiago facing the other South American champions finishing second behind [[Vasco da Gama]] and Di St\u00e9fano scored 4 goals in 6 games. During the Argentinian championship of 1948, the Football Association suspended the tournament for a short time due to the protests of the players led by [[Adolfo Pedernera]] and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and materialised with a player's strike in a bid to gain a professional footballer's status and rights. Despite that upheaval Di St\u00e9fano scored 13 goals in 23 games and River Plate finished third. The strike last for 8 months until 1949 and it eventually meant the departure of the best Argentine footballers towards other championships, in particular towards that Colombian, which was one of the  lucrative in the world at the time. In one of his last games in Argentina, on 31 July 1949, Di St\u00e9fano played in the role of goalkeeper, replacing the owner [[Amadeo Carrizo]] for twenty minutes and keeping the clean sheet in a derby won against [[Boca Juniors]].\n\n===Millonarios 1949-1953===\nAfter the [[Superga air disaster]], in May 1949, a friendly match between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Grande Torino]] was played and Di St\u00e9fano was promised to the Granata. However the Argentine forward was soon after contacted by [[Adolfo Pedernera]] who had already agreed terms with the Colombian Bogota-based club of [[Millonarios F.C.]]. On 9 August 1949, after another one of his teammates, [[N\u00e9stor Rossi]] signed for the Colombian club without the president of River Plate receiving any compensation for the transfer of the players as the Colombian FA was still not affiliated with FIFA, Di St\u00e9fano signed for the Colombians. Millonarios  who anyway could not afford not to pay the transfer fees, offered him a salary clearly higher than that received at River Plate, and the Argentine forward started a new chapter in his career in Colombia, in period called [[El Dorado (Colombian football)|El Dorado]]. Many international stars like the Hungarians [[B\u00e9la S\u00e1rosi]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u0151ke]], Lithuanian [[Vytautas Kri\u0161\u010di\u016bnas]], the Argentines [[Ren\u00e9 Pontoni]], [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]], English [[Charlie Mitten]] from [[Manchester United]] for 5.000 pounds a year, [[Neil Franklin]] from [[Stoke City]], French-Hungarian [[Ferenc Nyers]], Italian [[Luigi Di Franco]], the Brazilian legend [[Heleno de Freitas]] and others had joined the league after legendary Perdenera first signed. The Colombian League became at the time the best in the world and with the highest salaries.\n\nThe Colombian league had turned professional in 1948 started the [[El Dorado (Colombian football)|El Dorado period]] on 25 April 1949. Di St\u00e9fano, Perdenera and Nestor Rossi who joined Millonarios in the summer formed the famous trio called the [[Ballet Azul]] and helped them win their first title ever beating [[Deportivo Cali]] in the [[1949 Campeonato Profesional| 1949 final]], with Di St\u00e9fano scoring 16 goals in 14 games. Di St\u00e9fano scored 23 goals in 29 games the following [[1950 Campeonato Profesional| 1950 season]], but Millonarios  finished 2 points behind eventual champions [[Once Caldas|Deportes Caldas]]. Di St\u00e9fano, who kept in excellent condition, excelled during his games and led Millonarios to the other second title in [[1951 Campeonato Profesional|1951]] leaving runners-up [[Boca Juniors de Cali]] by 11 points behind on the final table and scoring 32 goals in 34 games, more than any other player in the league. Millonarios would go on to lose the [[Copa Colombia]] of 1951 (played in 1952) to [[Boca Juniors de Cali]].\n\nThe [[1952 Campeonato Profesional|1952 league]] had the same outcome: Milionarios overtook [[Boca Juniors de Cali]], won their third title and Di St\u00e9fano was once again top-scorer with 19 goals. In October 1952, Di St\u00e9fano also led Millonarios to the final of [[Copa Colombia]] after beating Deportivo C\u00facuta by 2\u20131. The final would be played in May 1953, but with Di St\u00e9fano already in Argentina.\n\nIn October 1951 [[Divisi\u00f3n Mayor del F\u00fatbol Profesional Colombiano|DIMAYOR]] had agreed the Pacto de Lima with the FIFA, with the requirement that the foreign players would return to their countries after October 1954. He totally scored 267 goals in 292 goals for Milionarios and is considered still as one of the best footballers the history of the Colombian League.\n\n===The disputed transfer to Spain===\n\nIn March 1952, [[Real Madrid]] organized a friendly tournament in the Spanish capital, at its newly constructed home ground, [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] was invited to participate in Real Madrid's  50th-anniversary tournament. The tournament was called Bodas de Oro, but once Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu heard about the new powerhouse in South America, Millonarios cancelled the invitation to River Plate and invited the Colombians as the representative of South America. The Colombians participated in the tournament and won it, after drawing 2\u20132 with Swedish champions [[IFK Norrkoping]] and overcoming the Los Blancos who were managed by Argentine legend [[Hector Scarone]] by 4\u20132 with a brace from ''Saeta Rubia'' under the presence of President [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]], who arrived to the stadium to observe [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. Instead, Bernab\u00e9u asked Millonarios about Di St\u00e9fano and a deal was struck between him and Millonarios owner Alfonso Senor Quevedo, both sympathetic to the conservative regimes of the time in Spain and Colombia. Millonarios would start a global tour and spearheaded by Di St\u00e9fano, they would beat Hungary and world champions Uruguay.\n\nSoon, after Millonarios' return to Colombia, the Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with  River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held the his card for the transfer of Di St\u00e9fano in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian liras (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). That was when a head-to-head match between the two Spanish rivals for his purchase was born. In Christmas 1952, Di St\u00e9fano still contracted with Millonarios, returned briefly to Buenos Aires, where he was even making plans to abandon football and start a business as Argentine league was still not professional.  \n\nFIFA expressed a favourable attitude towards Barcelona about the issue, sanctioning the contract of the player to the blaugrana. However the Spanish Football Association blocked the transfer. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation, linked to Francisco Franco, as mediator. Calero decided to let Real Madrid play the seasons 1953-1954 and in 1955-1956 and in Barcelona the years 1954-1955 and 1956\u20131957. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president who was forced to resign in September 1953. \n\nAs his first few games were unimpressive, Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to the Blancos signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, 16,000 of salary to the Argentine with doubled bonus compared to his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club. This fact contributed greatly to the rivalry with the Catalan club. Before the arrival of Di St\u00e9fano, the club of the Spanish capital was neither the largest club in the country, nor the largest in the city: Real Madrid did not have a great football tradition, in fact had won only two championships, while Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were six and four respectively.\n\n===Real Madrid: The first European triumph===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|180px|Di St\u00e9fano scoring a goal for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] where he won 15 official titles]]\n\nA 27-year-old Di St\u00e9fano arrived at Real Madrid on 22 September 1953, after seven months of inactivity, and made his debut with the white jersey in October 1953 in a cl\u00e1sico against champions Barcelona, won 5\u20130 with a hat trick by Di St\u00e9fano. Real Madrid had an average team and had not won the title in 20 years. In his first months in Madrid, the Argentine champion did not adapt to European football, but imposed his own style, playing all around the field with speed and the ball low on the ground. At the first season with Real Madrid, Di St\u00e9fano became the top scorer of the [[1953\u201354 La Liga]] with 27 goals in 28 appearances, contributing significantly to the title victory: the Blancos managed to win the Spanish championship after two decades.\n\nThe following year, Real Madrid acquired Argentine [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]] from the [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional Montevideo]], a signing recommended by Di St\u00e9fano, for the attack of the Merengues. The club won another League in [[1954\u201355 La Liga|1955]] leaving Barcelona again in the second place of the table. Di St\u00e9fano scored 25 goals, finishing behind only [[Juan Arza]] (28) among the scorers of the Spanish league. On 26 June 1955, the Spanish club won their first ever [[Latin Cup]] beating [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]]'s [[Stade de Reims]] in the final, in Paris by 2\u20130.  \n\nThe second consecutive Spanish title allowed Real Madrid to be the first representative of Spain in the inaugural [[UEFA Champions League|Champions Cup]] in its first edition in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|1955-1956 season]]. Di St\u00e9fano made his Champions Cup debut against [[Servette]] in a 2\u20130 away win. In the league he was again the top scorer (24 goals), but despite that, [[Athletic Bilbao]] won the tournament ahead of Bar\u00e7a and Real. In the Champions Cup the team made their way eliminating the Swiss and later [[Partizan Belgrade]], after a suffering a 3\u20130 defeat in Yugoslavia. With the guidance of Di St\u00e9fano they had an easy 4\u20130 victory in Madrid in the first leg, in December 1956. Real Madrid team flew to Belgrade and, despite the snowstorm that had hit the city in the previous days, the president Bernab\u00e9u agreed for the match not to be postponed. Unlike the Spaniards, the Partizan players did not suffer on the terrain, took the lead and dominated the game. A penalty is awarded to Real Madrid, but [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]] slipped when kicking and missed it. In the final minutes with the Serbians up by 3\u20130, Di St\u00e9fano helped defending and Real qualified despite a clear defeat.  The Blancos eliminated Milan in the semi-finals [64] and entered the final in Paris against [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]]'s [[Stade de Reims]]. Real Madrid suffered in the first half, but Di St\u00e9fano lifted his teammates to come back and win the trophy by 4\u20133. At the end of the year, on 18 December 1956, the [[1956 Ballon d'Or|Ballon s'Or]] was born and Di St\u00e9fano missed the award for just 3 votes to [[Stanley Matthews]].\n\n===Naturalisation and the built of an empire===\n[[File:DiStefanoPuskas.jpg|thumb|upright|Di St\u00e9fano with his friend [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]]]]\n\nIn the summer of 1956, Real Madrid signed [[Raymond Kopa]] from the Stade de Reims. The French forward could not feature in the games due to the limit of foreigners in La Liga and had to wait for the Spanish naturalisation of Di St\u00e8fano, who became a Spanish citizen in October 1956.<br>\nThe season started early with the participation of Real Madrid in the [[1956 Small Club World Cup]] in Caracas, Venezuela as European champions. The Spaniards faced [[Vasco da Gama]], [[AS Roma]] and FC Porto playing against players like World Cup winner[[Alcides Ghiggia]] and [[Vav\u00e1]]. Real won the trophy with 3 wins and Di St\u00e9fano finished as top scorer of the tournament with 4 goals (same as [[Vav\u00e1]]).<br>\nAs Real Madrid did not win the title in the previous season, president [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u]], who also served as the vice-president of the competition, came up with the idea that the Champions Cup winner had the right to register for the next edition to defend the victory even if it had lost the championship. Consequently, Real participated in the [[1956\u201357 European Cup|1956-1957 season]], eliminating [[Rapid Vienna]], Nice and [[Manchester United]] in the semifinals and beating [[Fiorentina]] by 2\u20130 in the final, in Madrid. During the season, Real also asserted itself in the last edition of the [[Latin Cup]] , overcoming [[Benfica]] 1\u20130 in the final with a decisive goal by Di St\u00e9fano and at the end of the year, he won the [[1957 Ballon d'Or]]. From the twenty-third day of the 1956-1957 championship, Real Madrid started a series of consecutive victorious home results that ended only in 1966, at the twenty-fifth round of the Liga, after 121 matches. The Blancos attack was one of the best in history and boasted Di St\u00e9fano, [[H\u00e9ctor Rial]], [[Francisco Gento]] and Kopa. Real won the [[1956\u201357 La Liga|1957 championship]] and Di St\u00e9fano was again the scorer of the Liga with 31 goals.\n\nIn the following season, Real Madrid is further strengthened with the arrival of Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Santamaria]] in defense. Di St\u00e9fano scored 19 goals and won the top scorer award, obtaining the [[1957\u201358 La Liga|1958 title]] at the expense of [[Atletico Madrid]]. In the quarter-finals of the [[1957\u201358 European Cup|1958 Champions Cup]], Real Madrid faced [[Sevilla FC]] humiliating their  opponents in the first leg in Madrid with an 8-0 where he scored four goals. On their return, in Seville, Di St\u00e9fano was greeted by the insulting choruses of opposing fans and Real were held on 2\u20132. In the semifinals, Di St\u00e8fano contributed to the success against Hungarian Vasas and the team reached the final against [[Juan Alberto Schiaffino]]'s Milan. Real Madrid won the final with a 3\u20132 in comeback and the Argentinian all-around player finished the tournament as the top scorer with 10 goals.\n\nBut the season finished with the loss of the [[1958 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|1958 General\u00edsimo Cup]] after they lost 2-0 to [[Athletic Bilbao]]. As a result, [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] signed with Real Madrid in the summer of 1958 to strengthen the squad and Real Madrid would be blessed with one of the most lethal attacking pairs in the history of football. Nevertheless, Real finished second in the [[1958\u201359 La Liga|1959 season]] behind Bar\u00e7a and Don Alfredo with 23 goals he was the best scorer in the league for the fifth and last time, the fourth in a row. \n\nAfter overcoming the rival citizens of [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] after three games in semi-final, Real Madrid won its fourth consecutive [[1958\u201359 European Cup|Champions Cup]] by overtaking again [[Stade de Reims]] again with a score of 2\u20130. During the final, [[Enrique Mateos]], the substitute of Pusk\u00e1s (the Hungarian feared retaliation and decided not to depart with the tam for the final in Stuttgart), took a penalty instead of Di St\u00e9fano and missed it. But, in the beginning of the second half, Di St\u00e9fano scored the second goal and Real Madrid was already a legend throughout the world, the most famous team that everyone wanted to watch.<br>\nOn 16 July, 1959, Real Madrid hosted [[Pele]]'s Santos during their European tour. It was one of the most anticipated games of the tour, given of the reputation that Pele had started building. Di St\u00e9fano's team would beat the Brazilians by 5\u20133. In December, France Football awarded Di St\u00e9fano the [[1959 Ballon d'Or]], which he won ahead of team-mate [[Raymond Kopa]] (who had already returned to [[Stade de Reims]] in the summer of 1959) and [[Juventus]]'s Welsh star [[John Charles]]. Pusk\u00e1s and Gento both finished in the top ten. That was when, during the [[1959-60 La Liga|1959-1960 season]], the Madrilenians signed the Brazilian midfielder [[Didi (footballer, born 1928)|Didi]] who was a World Cup winner, former teammate of [[Garrincha]] and [[Pele]] and the best player of the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. Given that the style of play of the Brazilian was similar to Di St\u00e9fano's, the Brazilian often clashed with the Argentine and there were rumours that he was the one to ask from the club's hierarchy his departure at the summer of 1960. But with Didi in the squad, the Blancos won the fifth consecutive [[1959\u201360 European Cup|Champions Cup]], after eliminating Barcelona in the semifinals, Real Madrid played in the final of the [[Hampden Park]] in Glasgow in front of 135,000 spectators against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. Di St\u00e9fano and Pusk\u00e1s scored three and four goals respectively, in a game considered to be among the finest in the history of football. Di St\u00e9fano scored 8 goals in the [[1959\u201360 European Cup|1960 competition]], finishing second in the scorers' chart won by Pusk\u00e1s. In the [[1959\u201360 La Liga|1960 season]], Real finished equal with Barcelona on the table, but the Catalans were the ones to be awarded the title. Di St\u00e9fano did not win the Pichichi award as Pusk\u00e1s was the topscorer of the league with 25 goals. And they lost [[1960 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]] to [[Atletico Madrid]] by 3\u20131 home on 26 June 1960.\n\n===European decline and the first double===\nThe new season started with the inaugural [[1960 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] and the 0\u20130 draw in the first leg of the final against [[Pe\u00f1arol]] in Montevideo on July 4. But in the second leg, Real beat the Uruguayans by 5\u20130 with Di St\u00e9fano scoring one goal on 4 September 1960. On 13 December 1960, Di St\u00e9fano came fourth on the [[1960 Ballon d'Or]] voting, and for the first time, Real were knocked out of [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1960-61 Champions Cup]], against Barcelona (4-3) after a controversial return match. Real easily won the [[1960-61 La Liga|1961 title]] with a great margin to runners-up [[Atletico Madrid]], but lost again the final of the [[1961 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]], again to Rojiblancos (3-2). Di St\u00e9fano finished the season with 21 goals, second scorer of the league behind Pusk\u00e1s who netted 28 goals.\n\nIn the [[1961-62 La Liga|1961-1962 season]] Di St\u00e9fano won the double for the first time, winning the [[1962 Copa del General\u00edsimo Final|General\u00edsimo Cup]] 15 years since the last time after beating Sevilla 2\u20131 with two goals from Pusk\u00e1s to overturn the initial red and white advantage. He finished 6th in the [[1961 Ballon d'Or]] in December and \n. In the [[1961-62 European Cup|1961-62 European season]], Real reached the final of the tournament for the sixth time in its history, after eliminating [[Juventus]] and [[Standard Liegue]]. Real played against [[Eus\u00e9bio]]'s [[Benfica]] and though the Spaniards took the lead twice, in the second half of the game the Lusitanians won the title by 5\u20133, courtesy of [[Eusebio]]. Real lost its first European Cup final and for the first time Di St\u00e9fano did not score in a final (the three goals were scored by Pusk\u00e1s). Nevertheless, he was among the best scorers of the competition for the second time in his career, with 7 goals.\n\nIn the autumn of 1962, the Blancos were knocked out of the [[1962-63 European Cup|European Cup]], against [[Anderlecht]]. But, with Di St\u00e9fano at the age of 37, Real won the [[1962-63 La Liga|1963 title]] over [[Atletico Madrid]], with Pusk\u00e1s finishing as top scorer once again. \n\nThe [[1963-64 La Liga|1963-1964 season ]] was the last of Di St\u00e9fano at Real Madrid. At the beginning of the season, the team had a pre-season tour in Venezuela as the team participated in the [[Small Club World Cup|1963 Small Club World Cup]] against S\u00e3o Paulo and FC Porto. Di St\u00e9fano played on the first match on 20 August but on 24 August 1963, the Argentine champion is kidnapped by the National Liberation Armed Forces of Venezuela in the Potomac hotel in Caracas, and was released by them three days later, unharmed. The incident cost the Los Blancos the trophy as without Di St\u00e9fano they did not manage overcoming S\u00e3o Paulo in the final game.<br>\nThe Blancos clinched the fourth consecutive Liga and reached the final of the [[1963-64 European Cup|1964 European Cup]] after defeating AC Milan in the quarterfinals (4-3). Real Madrid faced [[Helenio Herrera]]'s [[Inter Milan]] in the final. Hours before the final, Di St\u00e9fano explicitly criticized the tactics designed by Real Madrid coach [[Miguel Mu\u00f1oz]] against Italian defender [[Giacinto Facchetti]]. The relationship between Mu\u00f1oz, who had the support of President Bernab\u00e9u, and the Argentine player was already torn. And [[Inter Milan]] won the final by 3\u20131.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Bernab\u00e9u proposes to 38 year-old Di St\u00e9fano to join the technical staff of Real Madrid, and the Argentine declined the offer preferring to continue playing. That final against the Italian was Di St\u00e9fano's the last game as the club decided not to renew his contract.\n\n===Real Madrid career in numbers===\nAlfredo Di St\u00e9fano played for Real Madrid 11 years and won 8 Spanish championships, 1 Spanish Cup, 2 Latin Cups, 5 consecutive Champions Cups (scoring in all the finals he won), 1 Intercontinental Cup, several individual titles including 5 times the League's topscorer. He scored 418 goals in 510 games, of which 308 goals in 396 official matches (49 goals in 59 matches in the Champions Cup), becoming the best scorer in the history of the club, until that record was surpassed several decades later first by [[Ra\u00fal]] and then by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].\n\n===Espanyol===\nAfter the Champions Cup final loss in 1964 against Inter Milan, president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and with Di St\u00e9fano at the age of 38, offered him a place in the Real Madrid coaching staff instead of renewing the player contract. Di St\u00e9fano refused Bernab\u00e9u's proposal and he moved to Real Espanyol. \n\nThe Argentine veteran scored 9 goals in all competitions in his first season, putting an end to a strip of 15 consecutive seasons in which he scored in double figures (18 total). After 14 goals in 60 matches with Espanyol, he retired as a player at 40 in 1966, helping his team avoid relegation on both seasons. At the end of his career and despite what was previously stated, Bernab\u00e9u decided to throw a farewell match against Celtic in Madrid, to honour him for his services.\n\n== International career ==\nDi St\u00e9fano played with three different national teams during his career,<ref name=\"Guardian obit\">{{cite news|title=Alfredo di St\u00e9fano was one of football's greatest trailblazers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/07/alfredo-di-stefano-real-madrid|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> scoring 6 goals in 6 appearances for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and 23 in 31 appearances for [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

He scored his first international goal in that same match, helping Argentina to a 7\u20130 win. Di St\u00e9fano scored five more goals during the championship - including his first hat-trick against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] - as Argentina successfully defended the title they had won [[1946 South American Championship|the previous year]] on home soil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southamerican Championship 1947|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/47safull.html|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref> \n\nDi St\u00e9fano's six games during that tournament would prove to be his only appearances for Argentina. Player strikes, and a dispute with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]], forced Argentina to withdraw from qualifying for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Brazil]], as well as the [[1949 South American Championship|1949]] and [[1953 South American Championship|1953]] South American Championships. By the time [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying]] began for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA]] had banned Di St\u00e9fano from making any further appearances for Argentina, on account of his appearances for the Colombia XI two years earlier - though Argentina once again pulled out of qualifying. \n\n===Colombia===\nAfter moving to Bogota in 1949, during a break in the Colombian League in 1951, friendly matches were organised under the name of combined XI of the Colombian league. Di St\u00e9fano - without ever holding a Colombian passport - made four appearances for the Colombian XI team, which did not appear in the official records of FIFA.\n\n===Spain===\nDi St\u00e9fano was widely loved in Spain, and having been banned from playing for Argentina, it made sense for Di St\u00e9fano to play for Spain. FIFA initially refused to sanction this, but after Di St\u00e9fano acquired Spanish citizenship in 1956, and amid pressure from the Spanish FA, the decision was eventually reversed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alfredo Di Stefano: Real Madrid legend dies at the age of 88 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28197863 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> Di St\u00e9fano consequently made his debut for Spain on 30 January 1957 in a friendly in Madrid, scoring a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win<ref name=eufoot/> to become one of only a few [[List of Spain international footballers born outside Spain|players born outside Spain]] to have appeared for their national team.\n\nThe Spanish team, with a forward line also boasting Barcelona and Real Madrid stars [[Laszlo Kubala]], [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] and [[Francisco Gento]], were favourites to qualify for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], having been drawn into a [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification group]] with Scotland and minnows Switzerland. However, Spain began their campaign with a 2\u20132 draw against the Swiss and then lost to Scotland at [[Hampden Park]] 4\u20132. Spain won both of the reverse fixtures 4\u20131, but the damage had already been done: Scotland beat Switzerland in their final match and qualified at Spain's expense. Di St\u00e9fano, who had played in all four games and scored two goals, missed out yet again.\n\nIn 1961, at the age of 36, Di St\u00e9fano finally qualified for a World Cup, helping Spain qualify for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 edition]] in [[Chile]].

In July 1942, having just completed the first two of the series, N\u00e9mirovsky was arrested as a Jew and detained at [[Pithiviers]] and then [[Auschwitz]], where she was murdered, a victim of the [[Holocaust]]. The notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters but not examined until 1998. They were published in a single volume entitled ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' in 2004.\n\n==Background==\nThe sequence was to portray life in France in the period following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]] on 14 June. The first novel, ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' (''Storm in June'') depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and in the days following it. The second, ''Dolce'' (''Sweet''), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as N\u00e9mirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.\n\nThe third novel, ''Captivit\u00e9'' (''Captivity''), for which N\u00e9mirovsky left a plot outline, would have shown the coalescing of a resistance, with some characters introduced in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' and ''Dolce'' having been arrested and put under threat of death, in Paris. The fourth and fifth novels would perhaps have been called ''Batailles'' (''Battles'') and ''La Paix'' (''Peace'') but these exist only as titles in N\u00e9mirovsky's notebook, against which she had placed question marks. Nothing can be said about the plots of ''Batailles'' and ''La Paix''. To quote N\u00e9mirovsky's notes, they are \"in limbo, and what limbo! It's really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens\".\n\n==Books==\n\n===''Temp\u00eate en juin''===\n\nThe narrative follows several groups of characters who encounter one another rarely if at all. All are impelled to flee from Paris in advance of the German entry into the city. As transport and distribution collapse under German bombardment, all have to change their plans and nearly all lose the veneer of civilization.\n\nThe P\u00e9ricands are making for [[N\u00eemes]], where they have property. They reach the city but in the course of the journey, Charlotte P\u00e9ricand's senile father-in-law is left behind (forgotten) while her second son, Hubert, runs away to join the army and shares in its collapse. Her elder son, Philippe, is a priest and is shepherding a party of orphans, who eventually kill him (in a death scene perhaps in need of revision, N\u00e9mirovsky comments in her notebook, because it is ''melo'' [melodramatic]). Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for [[Vichy]], where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the [[Loire]]; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably.\n\nMaurice and Jeanne Michaud, minor employees at a bank, are instructed to go to [[Tours]] though deprived at the last minute of the transport promised by their employer. Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads.\n\n===''Dolce''===\nThe small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P\u00e9ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords.\n\nThe main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French.\n\nThe minor plot concerns the family of Beno\u00eet Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc\u00e9e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno\u00eet also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.

In July 1942, having just completed the first two of the series, N\u00e9mirovsky was arrested as a Jew and detained at [[Pithiviers]] and then [[Auschwitz]], where she was murdered, a victim of the [[Holocaust]]. The notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters but not examined until 1998. They were published in a single volume entitled ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' in 2004.\n\n==Background==\nThe sequence was to portray life in France in the period following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]] on 14 June. The first novel, ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' (''Storm in June'') depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and in the days following it. The second, ''Dolce'' (''Sweet''), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as N\u00e9mirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.\n\nThe third novel, ''Captivit\u00e9'' (''Captivity''), for which N\u00e9mirovsky left a plot outline, would have shown the coalescing of a resistance, with some characters introduced in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' and ''Dolce'' having been arrested and put under threat of death, in Paris. The fourth and fifth novels would perhaps have been called ''Batailles'' (''Battles'') and ''La Paix'' (''Peace'') but these exist only as titles in N\u00e9mirovsky's notebook, against which she had placed question marks. Nothing can be said about the plots of ''Batailles'' and ''La Paix''. To quote N\u00e9mirovsky's notes, they are \"in limbo, and what limbo! It's really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens\".\n\n==Books==\n\n===''Temp\u00eate en juin''===\n\nThe narrative follows several groups of characters who encounter one another rarely if at all. All are impelled to flee from Paris in advance of the German entry into the city. As transport and distribution collapse under German bombardment, all have to change their plans and nearly all lose the veneer of civilization.\n\nThe P\u00e9ricands are making for [[N\u00eemes]], where they have property. They reach the city but in the course of the journey, Charlotte P\u00e9ricand's senile father-in-law is left behind (forgotten) while her second son, Hubert, runs away to join the army and shares in its collapse. Her elder son, Philippe, is a priest and is shepherding a party of orphans, who eventually kill him (in a death scene perhaps in need of revision, N\u00e9mirovsky comments in her notebook, because it is ''melo'' [melodramatic]). Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for [[Vichy]], where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the [[Loire]]; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably.\n\nMaurice and Jeanne Michaud, minor employees at a bank, are instructed to go to [[Tours]] though deprived at the last minute of the transport promised by their employer. Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads.\n\n===''Dolce''===\nThe small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P\u00e9ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords.\n\nThe main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French.\n\nThe minor plot concerns the family of Beno\u00eet Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc\u00e9e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno\u00eet also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N\u00e9mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.)\n\nThe stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno\u00eet in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno\u00eet brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why.\n\nAfter an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, ''Dolce'' ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno\u00eet to a new refuge. The title of ''Dolce'', like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, ''dolce'' means \"sweet\" or \"soft\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow.\n\n===''Captivit\u00e9''===\n\nThe plot of N\u00e9mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.  A review of her work published in ''The New Republic'' states:<blockquote>\nN\u00e9mirovsky was the very definition of a [[self-hating Jew]]. Does that sound too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France ''entre deux guerres'' in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. N\u00e9mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews\u2014some of them even have hooked noses, no less!\u2014appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles.

There are men's competitions, organized only in Poland.\n\nThe first Memorial was held in 2003. The competition has been held every year since.\n\n==Tournament==\n\n===History===\nThe tournament is played in the middle of the year, always about two weeks before the most important event of the year. Competitions have been created in memory of the best volleyball coach in Poland, Hubert Jerzy Wagner, who won the [[1974 FIVB Men's Volleyball World Championship]], the [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|Olympic gold in 1976]] and silver medals in the [[Men's European Volleyball Championship]] in [[1975 Men's European Volleyball Championship|1975]] and [[1983 Men's European Volleyball Championship|1983]] for the Polish team.\n\nIn the first few years teams played in Olsztyn. It is now played in various Polish cities to promote volleyball. In 2008, the memorial was also the qualifying tournament for the [[2009 Men's European Volleyball Championship]]. The first memorial was won by the [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Dutch national team]], which was ahead of [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and [[Spain men's national volleyball team|Spain]]. In the second edition [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] triumphed, and the next again The Netherlands. The winner of the fourth edition was Poland, the fifth - [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]]. The next two editions were again won by the hosts. In 2010 the winners were [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], and in 2011 [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]]. In 2012 the edition of the memorial was won by Poland ahead of Germany, [[Argentina men's national volleyball team|Argentina]] and [[Iran men's national volleyball team|Iran]]. Poland retained the title in 2013.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 85%; margin: 0

Wagner foundation. There are men's competitions, organized only in Poland.\n\nThe first Memorial was held in 2003. The competition has been held every year since.\n\n==Tournament==\n\n===History===\nThe tournament is played in the middle of the year, always about two weeks before the most important event of the year. Competitions have been created in memory of the best volleyball coach in Poland, Hubert Jerzy Wagner, who won the [[1974 FIVB Men's Volleyball World Championship]], the [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|Olympic gold in 1976]] and silver medals in the [[Men's European Volleyball Championship]] in [[1975 Men's European Volleyball Championship|1975]] and [[1983 Men's European Volleyball Championship|1983]] for the Polish team.\n\nIn the first few years teams played in Olsztyn. It is now played in various Polish cities to promote volleyball. In 2008, the memorial was also the qualifying tournament for the [[2009 Men's European Volleyball Championship]]. The first memorial was won by the [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Dutch national team]], which was ahead of [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and [[Spain men's national volleyball team|Spain]]. In the second edition [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] triumphed, and the next again The Netherlands. The winner of the fourth edition was Poland, the fifth - [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]]. The next two editions were again won by the hosts. In 2010 the winners were [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], and in 2011 [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]]. In 2012 the edition of the memorial was won by Poland ahead of Germany, [[Argentina men's national volleyball team|Argentina]] and [[Iran men's national volleyball team|Iran]]. Poland retained the title in 2013.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 85%; margin: 0
