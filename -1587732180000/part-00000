Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cars, cows and construction vented about half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey in 2018, but almost a fifth was absorbed by trees.

Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cows, cars and construction vented about half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey in 2018, but almost a fifth was absorbed by trees.

The company purchased the second \"clear channel\" AM station [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI]] in 1975. In 1976, the company purchased its first stations outside of San Antonio. KXXO now [[KAKC]] and [[KMOD-FM]] in Tulsa were acquired under the name \"San Antonio Broadcasting\" (same as KEEZ). Stations were also added in Port Arthur, Texas (KPAC-AM-FM from Port Arthur College) and El Paso, Texas (KELP AM (now KQBU AM) from John Walton Jr.). In 1992, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] relaxed radio ownership rules slightly, allowing the company to acquire more than 2 stations per market. By 1995, Clear Channel owned 43 radio stations and 16 television stations. When the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] became law, the act deregulated media ownership, allowing a company to own more stations than previously allowed. Clear Channel went on a subsequent buying spree, purchasing more than 70 other media companies and individual stations.\n\nIn a few cases, following purchase of a competitor, Clear Channel was forced to [[Divestment|divest]] some of its stations, as it was above the legal thresholds in some cities. In 2005, the courts ruled that Clear Channel must also divest itself of some \"[[border blaster]]\" radio stations in international border cities, such as the [[alternative rock]] radio station [[XETRA-FM]] (\"91X\") in [[Tijuana, Baja California]]/[[San Diego]].\n\nIn 1997 Clear Channel moved out of pure broadcasting when it purchased billboard firm Eller Media,<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Apr-1997-8-K\">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/258/95013497003015/filing-main.htm |title=Clear Channel Communications, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Apr 17, 1997 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date=March 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017015818/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/258/95013497003015/filing-main.htm |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which was led by [[Karl Eller]].\n\nIn 1998 it made its first move outside of the United States when it acquired the leading UK outdoor advertising company More Group plc, which was led by [[Roger Parry]]; Clear Channel went on to buy many other outdoor advertising, radio broadcasting, and live events companies around the world, which were then re-branded Clear Channel International.

square.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Billboards at [[Dundas Square]] in Toronto, owned by Clear Channel.]]\n[[Clear Channel Outdoor]] (CCO) is an advertising company that was previously owned by iHeartMedia. Under the Clear Channel umbrella, Clear Channel Outdoor was built from the acquisition of [[Eller Media]], Universal Outdoor, and More Group Plc, giving iHeartMedia outdoor advertising space in 25 countries, while CCO also has a stake in Jolly Pubblicita S.p.A. of Italy. Other units of CCO include:\n* BBH Exhibits\n* Yellow Checker Star Cab Displays\n* Dauphin OTA (created by [[Jacques Dauphin]])\n* [[Donrey Media]], Ackerley Media\n* Companies in [[Chile]], [[Poland]], and [[Switzerland]]\n* [[APN News & Media]] in Australia (49% stake, including [[Adshel]])\n\nIn the United States, CCO operates over 1,100 [[digital billboard]]s in 27 markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://company.clearchanneloutdoor.com/investor-relations/ |title=Investor Relations for Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCOH) |publisher=Company.clearchanneloutdoor.com |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233524/http://company.clearchanneloutdoor.com/investor-relations/ |archive-date=January 5, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Taxi Tops was sold to [[VeriFone]] in January 2010.  \n\nIn May 2019, it was spun out from iHeartMedia as part of its exit from bankruptcy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Television===\nThe first television station iHeartMedia purchased as Clear Channel was [[WPMI-TV|WPMI]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] in 1988. It owned more than 40 additional stations, a few of which are independent (non-network affiliates). In 2007, the company entered into an agreement to sell all its television stations to [[Providence Equity Partners]] for $1.2 billion,<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Apr-2007-8-K\" /> a deal that eventually closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Mar-2008-8-K\" /> All former Clear Channel television stations were owned by [[Newport Television]], while the other six were flipped to other buyers by Newport. In 2012 to mid-2013, Newport sold off all of its holdings to several other television groups, including [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], [[Cox Media Group]], [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].\n\n===Music charts===\niHeartMedia owns [[Mediabase]], which provide music charts based on songs and tracks receiving the most spins played on radio stations in the United States and Canada. A majority of stations that report to Mediabase are iHeartMedia outlets but other companies also report to the Mediabase charts. In addition, countdown shows produced by Premiere will utilize Mediabase charts for the basis of their programs.\n\n===News and information===\n* 24/7 News Source\n* Operates iHeartRadio News Network and local news networks in [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].\n* [[Premiere Radio Networks]]\n* Acquired and later sold the [[Agri Broadcast Network]] (ABN), a farm programming provider in Ohio.\n* Publishes ''Inside Radio'' magazine\n* Total Traffic reports: on-road and traffic conditions across the United States, and in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].

In addition, iHeartMedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of Premiere. While Premiere actively sells its shows to stations, the non-Premiere syndicated shows are often used as a cost-cutting measure and do not have a large sales staff. Those shows also do not carry network-wide advertising (unless distributed by a third party), and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots, which increases their appeal. These networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iHeartMedia-owned and non-iHeartMedia-owned stations.\n\nIn addition to its own syndication network, iHeartMedia offers studio space and other services to the [[WestStar TalkRadio Network]], which is based at iHeartMedia's studios in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. As a result, many WestStar programs are heard on iHeartMedia stations.\n\nNot all programming heard on iHeartMedia's radio stations are produced in house; however, most of iHeartMedia's stations share many similarities to each other in branding and programming.\n\n===Format Lab and HD2 Formats===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\nThe '''Format Lab''' was a radio programming think tank conceived, built and managed by Michael Albl for Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) that produced 84 formats for use on AM/FM/HD/XM/Stream/Mobile. The formats ranged from mainstream formats, music genre niches, lifestyles to the highly experimental. These formats were heard on most of Clear Channel's [[HD Radio]] subchannels, on SiriusXM, Sprint MSpot and used as the original music streaming service for Clear Channel Online Music and Radio (CCOMR). In 2009, the Format Lab split into two programming services (1) Terrestrial Radio known as Premium Choice and (2) iHeartRadio online streaming.\n\n===iHeartRadio===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\n'''iHeartRadio''' is a free broadcast, podcast and [[streaming radio]] [[Computing platform|platform]]. It is also the national umbrella brand for iHeartMedia's radio network aggregating its over 850 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the United States, as well as hundreds of other stations from various other media.\n\n===Alternative stations===\niHeartMedia Alternative Stations usually are branded as \"Radio\" (such as [[WRFF|Radio 104.5]] in Philadelphia or [[WRDA (FM)|Radio 105.7]]/[[WRDG|96.7]] in Atlanta), or \"ALT\" ([[KYSR|Alt 98.7]] in Los Angeles, and [[KLLT (FM)|Alt 104.9]] in St. Louis). Others include: The Edge, The Buzz, The Project, Star, or X. Their flagship Premium Choice Alternative Station is The Alternative Project broadcasting on WAXQ-FM 104.3 HD-2 in New York City. ''The Woody Show'', which originates from KYSR, serves as the anchor morning show for the iHeartMedia Alternative outlets.\n\n===Urban, urban AC and rhythmic stations===\nStations that carry programming catering to black Americans are a big part of many iHeartMedia clusters, particularly Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit. In many clusters iHeartMedia has two or more such stations. About half the Urban stations focus on Rap and Hip Hop along with younger [[rhythm and blues]] sounds. The other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some Soul from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s along with some current product. Some of the Hip Hop-based Urban stations report as Rhythmic Top 40 stations rather than Urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and Hispanic listeners. In a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iHeartMedia, one is focused on Rap while the other is focused on Soul. Examples include Philadelphia, with [[WUSL]]'s focus on hip hop while [[WDAS-FM]] focuses on Soul (in addition, the company also owns a rhythmic AC station in that area, which is [[WISX]] 106.1), and Chicago, where [[WGCI-FM]] focuses on rap while [[WVAZ]] is focused on Soul. iHeartMedia urban and urban AC stations are branded as \"Real\" ([[KRRL]] Los Angeles), \"Beat\" ([[KQBT]]/Houston, [[WBTP]] [[Tampa]]) or \"Power\" ([[WWPR-FM|WWPR]] New York City, [[WUSL]] [[Philadelphia]] and [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]] [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]). In San Francisco, iHeartMedia owned more urban-related stations such as Rhythmic Top 40 KYLD, [[urban oldies]] [[KISQ]], and [[urban contemporary]] [[KMEL]] in that area (KYLD shifted to Top 40/CHR in 2015, KISQ flipped to AC in 2016), and the same happened in [[Detroit]], where the company also owns [[urban AC]] [[WMXD]], [[urban contemporary]] [[WJLB]] and former [[rhythmic AC]] WDTW-FM (now [[WLLZ (FM)|WLLZ]]). iHeart also have Urban outlets with heritage and familiarity based on the markets they serve, like [[WHRK]] and [[WDIA]] in Memphis, and [[WKKV]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAnother growing format, Classic Hip-Hop/Throwback/Old School (consisting of R&B/Hip-Hop, Rap, and Rhythmic songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), can be heard full-time on iHeartRadio, as well as [[KATZ-FM]]/St. Louis and [[K256AS|KUBT-HD2 & its translator]] in Honolulu. Previously, this format was originated as Rhythmic Oldies, which was launched at KCMG/Los Angeles and later spread to more markets before the former Clear Channel flipped several stations out of the format by the mid-2000s.\n\nFor the Rhythmic Top 40 format, similar brandings include \"The Beat\" ([[KUBT]]/Honolulu and [[WBTT]]/Ft. Myers), [[KPRR|Power 102]]/El Paso, [[KKMY|104.5 Kiss FM]]/[[Beaumont, Texas]], \"Jam'n\" ([[KXJM]]/Portland Oregon, [[KSSX]]/San Diego, and [[WJMN-FM]]/Boston; a similar \"Jammin'\" is used at [[WSTV (FM)|WSTV]]/Roanoke & [[WJJX]]/Lynchburg). A \"B\" has been used at [[KBOS-FM|B95]]/Fresno since the 1980s. Others Rhythmics, such as [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]]/Seattle, [[KDON-FM]]/Salinas-Monterey and [[KGGI]]/Riverside-San Bernardino, simply use the call letters and/or frequency. Most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play Rhythmic Pop, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Dance tracks.\n\nFor rhythmic AC stations, they used to have the \"Party\" branding (particularly during the time when most used ''[[Wake Up with Whoopi]]'' as their morning show), but the two \"Party\" stations in [[Denver]] ([[KPTT]]) and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] ([[KYMT]], the former KPLV) have since exited the [[rhythmic AC]] format. KPTT and KPLV moved to top 40, but continue to use the \"Party\" branding (KPLV is currently Variety Hits). All iHeartMedia rhythmic AC stations are now differently branded per station, although one of the outlets, [[WMOV-FM]]/Norfolk, uses the \"[[Movin' (brand)|Movin']]\" moniker which is trademarked under another company (that station has since shifted to Rhythmic Top 40). ''The Breakfast Club Morning Show'' out of [[WWPR-FM]] in New York and \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\" out of KRRL in Los Angeles are iHeartMedia's syndicated urban morning shows.\n\n===Smooth jazz===\nAs noted earlier, iHeartMedia has the Smooth Jazz Network (aka Your Smooth Jazz), which is programmed by Broadcast Architecture. Unless otherwise noted, all Smooth Jazz Network stations will carry the following schedule: [[Kenny G]] and Sandy Kovach in morning drive time, Miranda Wilson in midday, Allen Kepler in afternoon drive time, and Maria Lopez in evenings, with no disc jockeys overnight. Weekend programming consists of the Smooth Jazz Top 20 with Allen Kepler, as well as the [[Dave Koz]] Radio Show.\n\n===Dance and EDM===\nAlthough they have no full-powered stations programming a Dance or EDM (Electronic Dance Music) format, iHeartMedia has FM translators and HD2 platforms broadcasting the EDM-intensive [[Evolution (HD radio)|Evolution]] platform, while the LGBT community is served by the more broader-based [[Pride Radio (HD)|Pride Radio]]. However, iHeartMedia's Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic Top 40 outlets incorporate a majority of Dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows. A weekly countdown program, ''America\u2019s Dance 30'', airs on selected iHeart Top 40 and Rhythmic stations.\n\n===News talk stations===\nNews talk stations owned by iHeartMedia usually have a standard slate of hosts. The morning show is usually local, with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts. Programs that appear on many iHeartMedia talk stations include the ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'' (Beck having gotten his talk show start at iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) owned [[WFLA (AM)|WFLA-AM]] in Tampa), ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''[[America Now with Andy Dean|America Now with Meghan McCain]]'' and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]] with George Noory'', all of which are affiliated with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in some fashion. ''The [[Mark Levin]] Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]'' are non-Premiere shows who air on many (if not most) iHeartMedia stations, as did ''[[The Savage Nation]]'' prior to its ending in September 2012. Limbaugh is almost universally carried on iHeartMedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station, including recently New York City: [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] was acquired in 2013 by Clear Channel and began carrying Limbaugh's program in 2014 following a long relationship with now-[[Cumulus Media]]-owned [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]. In markets where iHeartMedia-owned news talk stations have not been profitable (such as [[WXKS (AM)|Boston]] and [[WGST|Atlanta]]), iHeartMedia has chosen to sell shows such as Limbaugh and ''Coast to Coast AM'' to their rivals and change the stations to other formats.\n\nWhile most of iHeartMedia's news/talk stations carry some combination of Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity and Noory (of ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''), this is not always the case. Many stations (particularly in the larger markets) like [[KFI]], [[KFYI]], [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], [[WZZR]] and [[WLW]] broadcast a lineup with significant local programming.\n\niHeartMedia does not operate any [[all-news radio]] stations. For a brief time in the late 2000s, [[KFXR (AM)|KFXR]] in Dallas ran a direct feed of [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]] under the on-air name ''CNN 1190'', but KFXR dropped that format in 2009. Almost all of iHeartMedia's primary talk stations are affiliated with [[Fox News Radio]] for national news, part of a multi-year deal between iHeartMedia and Fox. However, since 2012 iHeartMedia has provided an all-news feed called 24/7 News. This radio network is exclusive to iHeartRadio. Since 2016, 24/7 News partners with [[NBC News]] to launch the [[NBC News Radio]].\n\n[[Liberal talk radio]] is heard on a few of iHeartMedia's stations, primarily secondary to its main news talk stations, and usually feature at least one local host with [[Dial Global]] programming; [[Air America Radio]] also aired on these stations. iHeartMedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats (see, for instance, [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]], [[WARF]], [[KLSD]], [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]], and [[WINZ (AM)|WINZ]]); in one case this had caused a protest when iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) wanted to change [[WXXM]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to a sports format. WXXM was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format, though they eventually retired it in November 2016 due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format.\n\niHeartMedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its AM news/talk stations on full-power FM stations, hoping to preserve their long-term viability while AM radio declines. Examples include [[San Diego]], [[California]], on KUSS 95.7 (which became [[KSSX|KOGO-FM]] after simulcasting [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO-AM]], replacing [[country music]]), [[Sacramento, California]] on KGBY 92.5 (which became [[KFBK-FM]] after simulcasting [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]], replacing [[hot adult contemporary]]), in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on KTZR-FM (which became [[KYWD|KNST-FM]] after simulcasting [[KNST]], replacing Spanish top 40), in [[Schenectady, New York]] ([[WGY-FM]]/103.1, simulcasting [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]/810, replacing rock WHRL) and [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WSYR-FM]]/106.9 simulcasting [[WSYR (AM)|WSYR]]/570, displacing urban AC \"Power\" to [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]]/620). After failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves, Clear Channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed KNST-FM to country music in February 2013 as [[KYWD]].\n\n===Sports talk stations===\nMost sports talk stations owned by iHeartMedia are affiliated with [[Fox Sports Radio]]. They are usually branded either ''Fox Sports'' or ''The Sports Animal''. Other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival [[ESPN Radio]] (in this case, [[WUCS]] in Hartford, Connecticut, which is nearby [[ESPN]]'s headquarters in Bristol).\n\n===Adult standards===\nMost of iHeartMedia's adult standards stations are turnkey operations, running a direct feed of a satellite format such as [[Dial Global]]'s [[America's Best Music]] or [[Music of Your Life]]. Most of these stations have no local jocks or Web sites. The network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them.\n\n===Adult contemporary===\niHeartMedia's [[adult contemporary]] stations are often branded as \"Lite FM\" (i.e. [[WLIT]] in Chicago or [[WLTW]] in New York, ) or \"Sunny\", although some stations use \"Magic\", \"B\" or something else similar as their identifiers, As of 2018, \"The Breeze\" has bought a new resurgence in Soft AC, targeted towards millennial listeners. Evenings are usually filled with [[Delilah Rene|Delilah]], unless that show is already aired by another station, in which case the [[John Tesh Radio Show]] is often substituted. Automated programming is the next option for the 7<small>PM</small>- 12 <small>AM</small> timeslot. ''Your Weekend with [[Jim Brickman]]'' and the in-house ''[[American Top 40]] the 1970s (or 1980s) with [[Casey Kasem]]'' are popular weekend syndicated programs on iHeartMedia stations. Most AC stations air [[Christmas music]] from the last week of November to Christmas Day. Some AC iHeartMedia stations are almost famous for playing [[Christmas music]] as early as November 1 such as [[KOSY-FM]] in [[Salt Lake City]] before they flipped to mainstream rock or [[WLKO]] playing its first Christmas song of the season 2\u20133 weeks before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. 2/3 of iHeartMedia stations that play Adult contemporary air Christmas formats.\n\nHot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as \"Mix\", \"Star\" or \"MYfm\" (i.e. [[KBIG]] in Los Angeles). Some Hot AC stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock. Other Hot AC stations have other brandings such as \"Wild 105.7 and 96.7\" on [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n===Contemporary hit radio===\niHeartMedia's CHR stations share a number of common brands, including \"[[KISS-FM (brand)|KISS-FM]]\" (e.g., [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] Los Angeles, [[WKSC-FM]] Chicago, [[WAKS]] Cleveland, [[WFKS]] Melbourne, [[WXKS-FM]] Boston), \"Z\" (e.g., [[WHTZ]] New York, [[KKRZ]] Portland Oregon [[WZFT]] Baltimore, [[KSLZ]] St. Louis), \"Wild\" (e.g., [[WLDI]] West Palm Beach, [[KYLD]] San Francisco), \"Power\" ([[WWPW]] Atlanta, [[WGEX]] Albany, Georgia), Channel (e.g., [[WKQI]] Detroit, [[WHQC]] Charlotte, [[KHTS-FM]] San Diego, [[WCHD]] Dayton-Springfield), or \"Hot\" (e.g., [[WIHT]] in Washington, D.C., [[WWHT]] in Syracuse, NY). Other brands, less commonly used, includes \"Radio Now\" ([[WRNW]] Milwaukee, [[WNRW]] Louisville), \"Q\" ([[WIOQ]] Philadelphia-102.1 FM-Q102, [[WQGA]] Waycross-Brunswick, Georgia-103.3 FM-103Q), \"B\" ([[WAEB-FM]] B 104 Allentown-Reading PA 104.1 FM), \"FM\" ([[WLAN-FM]] FM 97 96.9 FM Lancaster-Reading), \"V\" ([[WVRT]]& [[WVRZ]] V-97 Williamsport-Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), \"Max\" ([[WHCY]] Max 106.3 Sussex), \"K.C.\" ([[WKCI-FM]] KC 101, 101.3 FM, Hamden-New Haven, Connecticut/Long Island, New York) and \"X\" ([[WJMX-FM]] 103X, 103.3 FM Cheraw-Florence, South Carolina/The Pee Dee). Still other branding can be heard, however, when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market.\n\nAlthough a majority of these stations features a broad-based, mass appeal music presentation, several stations like [[WSNX]]/Grand Rapids and [[WKTU]]/New York City tend to lean towards Rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format (WKTU's sister is WHTZ) or a lack of a Rhythmic or R&B/Hip-Hop outlet (a void which WSNX also tries to fill).\n\nMany iHeartMedia CHR stations utilize syndicated morning shows, such as ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' based out of [[WHTZ]], New Jersey/New York's Z100 and ''Johnjay & Rich'' based out of [[KZZP]] Phoenix, Arizona (especially in the Rocky Mountain states). Some East Coast CHR stations carry ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (based out of [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in Los Angeles) middays. On weekends, syndicated programming includes ''[[American Top 40]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\n===Country music===\n[[Country music]] stations owned by iHeartMedia have begun transitioning to \"The Bull\" like [[KSD (FM)]] in St. Louis and \"Big\" like [[WEBG]] in Chicago as national brandings as of 2014. They almost universally carry ''After Midnite'', the syndicated overnight program currently hosted by Cody Alan, and often carry [[Bobby Bones (broadcaster)|Bobby Bones]]'s morning show as well.\n\n===Oldies and classic hits===\niHeartMedia's [[Oldies]] stations consists largely of FM stations with some AM stations. iHeartMedia uses brands such as \"Big\" and \"Kool\" on many of its stations. Nearly all of the FM stations play oldies spanning from 1964 to 1975, with a 500-song active playlist split nearly half 1960s and half 1970s. The playlist also includes approximately a dozen pre 1964 tracks and around 50 songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s. These stations generally have a few local live announcers; much of the time these stations are voicetracked either locally or from another market. Most run syndicated programming on weekends, such as [[Dick Bartley]] or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights, Steve Goddard's programs (''Goddard's Gold'' and/or ''The 70s''), and recently, ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The 70s''. A handful of iHeartMedia's outlets have picked up syndicated weeknight fare, such as Mike Harvey, Marty Thompson or [[Tom Kent]].\n\nThe AM oldies stations' playlists skew somewhat older and span from 1955 to about 1975. About 60 percent of the time they play 1964 to 1969 oldies, 20 percent pre 1964 oldies, and 20 percent music from the 1970s. Some of these also run Dick Bartley or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights. Some of the AM stations also run adult standards several hours on the weekend as well as limited specialized programming focusing on the pre 1964 era. Most of the AM stations are in smaller markets.\n\n===Rock===\niHeartMedia stations programming a rock format tend to play a blend of new rock and harder classic rock. Some carry ''[[Nights with Alice Cooper]]'' in the evenings while some others air ''[[Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx]]''. These stations tend to be live during the day and voicetracked at night. Some stations run ''[[Rockline]]'' with [[Bob Coburn]] and/or ''[[Little Steven's Underground Garage]]'' as well.\n\nWhile iHeartMedia classic rock stations operate under a wide variety of monikers, many are branded as \"[[The Fox (brand)|The Fox]]\" or \"[[The Brew (brand)|The Brew]]\". Often, these stations will carry [[Bob and Tom]] in morning drive. In the [[Southern United States]], ''[[John Boy and Billy]]'' is carried instead in most cases. (Both of the aforementioned shows are syndicated by Premiere.) Other shows include the ''Walton and Johnson Show'' out of Houston and Rover's Morning Glory out of Cleveland. Starting with WQBW Milwaukee (which has since switched to another format) and WBWR Columbus, several iHeartMedia stations have adopted a 1980s-centered classic rock approach called \"The Brew.\"\n\n===Spanish===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has an FM station carrying Hispanic programming full-time. In some markets the format is a Contemporary Tropical format while in others the format carried is more of a Mexican format. In a few markets an iHeartMedia FM station carries a rap based Spanish format known as [[Hurban]], which blends Spanish dance music with rhythm and blues hits as well as some Hip Hop. The division is run by Spanish radio executive [[Alfredo Alonso]], who joined iHeartMedia in September 2004 (when it still was called Clear Channel) as Senior Vice President of Hispanic Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|title=Clear Channel Radio joins pursuit of Hispanic listeners|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|access-date=2017-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040719/http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religious===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has a religious station on the AM band. Some of these sell blocks of time to outside organizations and have no local shows at all except where local churches buy time. These are formatted similarly to [[Salem Media]] stations.\n\nThe other type of religious format iHeartMedia uses in a few markets is a [[Gospel music]] based format. On these stations Gospel Music appealing to black Americans airs most of the time along with some block programming sold to religious groups. These stations are often programmed as urban stations that happen to be religious.\n\n===Specialties===\nIHeartMedia has one station in [[Hawaii]], [[KDNN]]/[[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]], programming a Contemporary Hawaiian Hits/Reggae format, along with an accompanying HD2 sub channel that features traditional Hawaiian music. Multicultural programming can also be heard on AM stations that iHeartMedia owns or has LMAs with. In March 2019, its [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] outlet, [[WSAN]], launched an all-podcast format. In November 2019, [[K256AS]]/[[KUCD]]-HD2 in Honolulu launched a variant Top 40 format with a focus on [[K-pop]] and other international pop hits.\n\n==Syndicated programs==\n: ''See [[List of programming syndicated by iHeartMedia]]''\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Market share===\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company became an object of persistent criticism.<ref>Klinenberg, Eric.

''Right of the Dial: The Rise of Clear Channel and the Fall of Commercial Radio''. Faber and Faber, 2008</ref> FCC regulations were relaxed following the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], allowing companies to own far more radio stations than before. After spending about $30 billion, Clear Channel owned over 1,200 stations nationwide, including as many as eight stations in certain markets. Although \"media reform\" social movement organizations like [[Future of Music Coalition]] mobilized against Clear Channel, so far the company has been able to hold on to all of its stations after divesting a few following the acquisition of AMFM, although over 500 stations have since been sold or are in the process of being sold since the company announced plans to become privately held.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\n{{Main|Clear Channel memorandum}}\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York and [[The Pentagon]], radio stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks. A small list was initially generated by the Clear Channel office on Thursday, September 13, 2001,<ref>In 2001, Jack Evans, regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel, attributed the creation of the list to individual program directors rather than management; however, the completed list was distributed to the program directors by management at Clear Channel.

Clear Channel denies that this was a list of banned songs, claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought. Also WOFX, Cincinnati, owned by Clear Channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list, even though radio headquarters was in Cincinnati at the time.<ref name=\"CC-PR\">{{cite press release |title=Clear Channel Says National \"Banned Playlist\" Does Not Exist |publisher=Clear Channel Communications, Inc. |date=2001-09-18 |url=http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923200949/http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2002 |access-date=2008-08-03 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Songs on the list included [[Tom Petty]]'s \"[[Free Fallin']]\", [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" and the entire [[Rage Against the Machine discography]].\n\n===Live music recordings===\nIn 2004, Clear Channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing [[Instant Live]] recordings, in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineer's console during the show, and then rapidly burned on [[CD]] so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue. This had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist, venue, and promoter, as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] concert recordings made by audience members. However, some media critics, as well as smaller business rivals, believed that Clear Channel was using the patent (on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks ''during recording'', so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track) to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees, even if they do not use precisely the same process. The patent was transferred to [[Live Nation]] when [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] was spun off, but the patent was revoked on March 13, 2007,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|date=2007-03-13|title=EFF Kills Bogus Clear Channel Patent|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|access-date=2016-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909095922/https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|archive-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for [[Telex Communications|Telex]].\n\n===Indecency zero tolerance===\nDuring the nationwide crackdown on indecent material following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in 2004]], Clear Channel launched a \"self-policing\" effort, and declared that there would be no \"indecent\" material allowed on the air.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> This led to the company's dismissal of several of their own employees, including popular and high-profile hosts in a number of cities. There were protests from free-speech advocates. During the same period, [[Howard Stern]] was dropped from six Clear Channel-owned stations in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky. By mid-year, rival [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through radio division [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]], and the original Viacom, not the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|current one]]) brought Stern's show back to those six markets. In June 2004, Viacom/Infinity Broadcasting Inc./One Twelve Inc. filed a $10 million lawsuit against Clear Channel for breaking of contracts and non-payment of licensing fees due to the dropping of Stern's show. (Viacom was Howard Stern's employer at the time, though he has since moved to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Satellite Radio]].) The following July, Clear Channel filed a countersuit of $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |work=USA Today |title=Clear Channel adopts 'zero-tolerance' indecency policy |date=February 25, 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016060125/http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\nIn the early 2000s, Clear Channel settled a lawsuit with a [[Denver, Colorado]] concert promoter, Nobody In Particular Presents (NIPP).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the lawsuit, NIPP alleged that Clear Channel halted airplay on its local stations for (NIPP) clients, and that Clear Channel would not allow NIPP to publicize its concerts on the air. The lawsuit was settled in 2004 when Clear Channel agreed to pay NIPP a confidential sum. However, a systematic analysis of concert ticket prices found no evidence that Clear Channel was cross-leveraging its radio interests with its (now divested) concert promotion interests.<ref>Alan B.

City officials attempted to contact the local Clear Channel office by telephone to spread warnings of the danger using its radio stations, but it was several critical hours before the station manager was finally reached at his home. In the meantime, [[9-1-1]] operators were advising panicked callers to tune to [[KCJB]] for emergency instructions, but the station was not broadcasting any such information.<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|title=Exclusive... 911 Calls in North Dakota Town Reveal Dangers of Media Consolidation|publisher=Democracy Now|date=25 January 2007|access-date=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206055034/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|archive-date=December 6, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the United States, with one person killed, and over 1,000 seeking medical attention.

St. Pete Pride has stated that throughout its eight-year history, Clear Channel has edited the organization's advertising material, and questioned whether the rejection of these images were because they displayed same-sex couples in affectionate poses.

It owned more than 40 additional stations, a few of which are independent (non-network affiliates). In 2007, the company entered into an agreement to sell all its television stations to [[Providence Equity Partners]] for $1.2 billion,<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Apr-2007-8-K\" /> a deal that eventually closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Mar-2008-8-K\" /> All former Clear Channel television stations were owned by [[Newport Television]], while the other six were flipped to other buyers by Newport. In 2012 to mid-2013, Newport sold off all of its holdings to several other television groups, including [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], [[Cox Media Group]], [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].\n\n===Music charts===\niHeartMedia owns [[Mediabase]], which provide music charts based on songs and tracks receiving the most spins played on radio stations in the United States and Canada. A majority of stations that report to Mediabase are iHeartMedia outlets but other companies also report to the Mediabase charts.

In addition, iHeartMedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of Premiere. While Premiere actively sells its shows to stations, the non-Premiere syndicated shows are often used as a cost-cutting measure and do not have a large sales staff. Those shows also do not carry network-wide advertising (unless distributed by a third party), and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots, which increases their appeal. These networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iHeartMedia-owned and non-iHeartMedia-owned stations.\n\nIn addition to its own syndication network, iHeartMedia offers studio space and other services to the [[WestStar TalkRadio Network]], which is based at iHeartMedia's studios in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. As a result, many WestStar programs are heard on iHeartMedia stations.\n\nNot all programming heard on iHeartMedia's radio stations are produced in house; however, most of iHeartMedia's stations share many similarities to each other in branding and programming.\n\n===Format Lab and HD2 Formats===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\nThe '''Format Lab''' was a radio programming think tank conceived, built and managed by Michael Albl for Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) that produced 84 formats for use on AM/FM/HD/XM/Stream/Mobile. The formats ranged from mainstream formats, music genre niches, lifestyles to the highly experimental. These formats were heard on most of Clear Channel's [[HD Radio]] subchannels, on SiriusXM, Sprint MSpot and used as the original music streaming service for Clear Channel Online Music and Radio (CCOMR). In 2009, the Format Lab split into two programming services (1) Terrestrial Radio known as Premium Choice and (2) iHeartRadio online streaming.\n\n===iHeartRadio===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\n'''iHeartRadio''' is a free broadcast, podcast and [[streaming radio]] [[Computing platform|platform]]. It is also the national umbrella brand for iHeartMedia's radio network aggregating its over 850 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the United States, as well as hundreds of other stations from various other media.\n\n===Alternative stations===\niHeartMedia Alternative Stations usually are branded as \"Radio\" (such as [[WRFF|Radio 104.5]] in Philadelphia or [[WRDA (FM)|Radio 105.7]]/[[WRDG|96.7]] in Atlanta), or \"ALT\" ([[KYSR|Alt 98.7]] in Los Angeles, and [[KLLT (FM)|Alt 104.9]] in St. Louis). Others include: The Edge, The Buzz, The Project, Star, or X. Their flagship Premium Choice Alternative Station is The Alternative Project broadcasting on WAXQ-FM 104.3 HD-2 in New York City. ''The Woody Show'', which originates from KYSR, serves as the anchor morning show for the iHeartMedia Alternative outlets.\n\n===Urban, urban AC and rhythmic stations===\nStations that carry programming catering to black Americans are a big part of many iHeartMedia clusters, particularly Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit. In many clusters iHeartMedia has two or more such stations. About half the Urban stations focus on Rap and Hip Hop along with younger [[rhythm and blues]] sounds. The other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some Soul from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s along with some current product. Some of the Hip Hop-based Urban stations report as Rhythmic Top 40 stations rather than Urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and Hispanic listeners. In a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iHeartMedia, one is focused on Rap while the other is focused on Soul. Examples include Philadelphia, with [[WUSL]]'s focus on hip hop while [[WDAS-FM]] focuses on Soul (in addition, the company also owns a rhythmic AC station in that area, which is [[WISX]] 106.1), and Chicago, where [[WGCI-FM]] focuses on rap while [[WVAZ]] is focused on Soul. iHeartMedia urban and urban AC stations are branded as \"Real\" ([[KRRL]] Los Angeles), \"Beat\" ([[KQBT]]/Houston, [[WBTP]] [[Tampa]]) or \"Power\" ([[WWPR-FM|WWPR]] New York City, [[WUSL]] [[Philadelphia]] and [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]] [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]). In San Francisco, iHeartMedia owned more urban-related stations such as Rhythmic Top 40 KYLD, [[urban oldies]] [[KISQ]], and [[urban contemporary]] [[KMEL]] in that area (KYLD shifted to Top 40/CHR in 2015, KISQ flipped to AC in 2016), and the same happened in [[Detroit]], where the company also owns [[urban AC]] [[WMXD]], [[urban contemporary]] [[WJLB]] and former [[rhythmic AC]] WDTW-FM (now [[WLLZ (FM)|WLLZ]]). iHeart also have Urban outlets with heritage and familiarity based on the markets they serve, like [[WHRK]] and [[WDIA]] in Memphis, and [[WKKV]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAnother growing format, Classic Hip-Hop/Throwback/Old School (consisting of R&B/Hip-Hop, Rap, and Rhythmic songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), can be heard full-time on iHeartRadio, as well as [[KATZ-FM]]/St. Louis and [[K256AS|KUBT-HD2 & its translator]] in Honolulu. Previously, this format was originated as Rhythmic Oldies, which was launched at KCMG/Los Angeles and later spread to more markets before the former Clear Channel flipped several stations out of the format by the mid-2000s.\n\nFor the Rhythmic Top 40 format, similar brandings include \"The Beat\" ([[KUBT]]/Honolulu and [[WBTT]]/Ft. Myers), [[KPRR|Power 102]]/El Paso, [[KKMY|104.5 Kiss FM]]/[[Beaumont, Texas]], \"Jam'n\" ([[KXJM]]/Portland Oregon, [[KSSX]]/San Diego, and [[WJMN-FM]]/Boston; a similar \"Jammin'\" is used at [[WSTV (FM)|WSTV]]/Roanoke & [[WJJX]]/Lynchburg). A \"B\" has been used at [[KBOS-FM|B95]]/Fresno since the 1980s. Others Rhythmics, such as [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]]/Seattle, [[KDON-FM]]/Salinas-Monterey and [[KGGI]]/Riverside-San Bernardino, simply use the call letters and/or frequency. Most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play Rhythmic Pop, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Dance tracks.\n\nFor rhythmic AC stations, they used to have the \"Party\" branding (particularly during the time when most used ''[[Wake Up with Whoopi]]'' as their morning show), but the two \"Party\" stations in [[Denver]] ([[KPTT]]) and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] ([[KYMT]], the former KPLV) have since exited the [[rhythmic AC]] format. KPTT and KPLV moved to top 40, but continue to use the \"Party\" branding (KPLV is currently Variety Hits). All iHeartMedia rhythmic AC stations are now differently branded per station, although one of the outlets, [[WMOV-FM]]/Norfolk, uses the \"[[Movin' (brand)|Movin']]\" moniker which is trademarked under another company (that station has since shifted to Rhythmic Top 40). ''The Breakfast Club Morning Show'' out of [[WWPR-FM]] in New York and \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\" out of KRRL in Los Angeles are iHeartMedia's syndicated urban morning shows.\n\n===Smooth jazz===\nAs noted earlier, iHeartMedia has the Smooth Jazz Network (aka Your Smooth Jazz), which is programmed by Broadcast Architecture. Unless otherwise noted, all Smooth Jazz Network stations will carry the following schedule: [[Kenny G]] and Sandy Kovach in morning drive time, Miranda Wilson in midday, Allen Kepler in afternoon drive time, and Maria Lopez in evenings, with no disc jockeys overnight. Weekend programming consists of the Smooth Jazz Top 20 with Allen Kepler, as well as the [[Dave Koz]] Radio Show.\n\n===Dance and EDM===\nAlthough they have no full-powered stations programming a Dance or EDM (Electronic Dance Music) format, iHeartMedia has FM translators and HD2 platforms broadcasting the EDM-intensive [[Evolution (HD radio)|Evolution]] platform, while the LGBT community is served by the more broader-based [[Pride Radio (HD)|Pride Radio]]. However, iHeartMedia's Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic Top 40 outlets incorporate a majority of Dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows. A weekly countdown program, ''America\u2019s Dance 30'', airs on selected iHeart Top 40 and Rhythmic stations.\n\n===News talk stations===\nNews talk stations owned by iHeartMedia usually have a standard slate of hosts. The morning show is usually local, with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts. Programs that appear on many iHeartMedia talk stations include the ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'' (Beck having gotten his talk show start at iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) owned [[WFLA (AM)|WFLA-AM]] in Tampa), ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''[[America Now with Andy Dean|America Now with Meghan McCain]]'' and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]] with George Noory'', all of which are affiliated with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in some fashion. ''The [[Mark Levin]] Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]'' are non-Premiere shows who air on many (if not most) iHeartMedia stations, as did ''[[The Savage Nation]]'' prior to its ending in September 2012. Limbaugh is almost universally carried on iHeartMedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station, including recently New York City: [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] was acquired in 2013 by Clear Channel and began carrying Limbaugh's program in 2014 following a long relationship with now-[[Cumulus Media]]-owned [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]. In markets where iHeartMedia-owned news talk stations have not been profitable (such as [[WXKS (AM)|Boston]] and [[WGST|Atlanta]]), iHeartMedia has chosen to sell shows such as Limbaugh and ''Coast to Coast AM'' to their rivals and change the stations to other formats.\n\nWhile most of iHeartMedia's news/talk stations carry some combination of Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity and Noory (of ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''), this is not always the case. Many stations (particularly in the larger markets) like [[KFI]], [[KFYI]], [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], [[WZZR]] and [[WLW]] broadcast a lineup with significant local programming.\n\niHeartMedia does not operate any [[all-news radio]] stations. For a brief time in the late 2000s, [[KFXR (AM)|KFXR]] in Dallas ran a direct feed of [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]] under the on-air name ''CNN 1190'', but KFXR dropped that format in 2009. Almost all of iHeartMedia's primary talk stations are affiliated with [[Fox News Radio]] for national news, part of a multi-year deal between iHeartMedia and Fox. However, since 2012 iHeartMedia has provided an all-news feed called 24/7 News. This radio network is exclusive to iHeartRadio. Since 2016, 24/7 News partners with [[NBC News]] to launch the [[NBC News Radio]].\n\n[[Liberal talk radio]] is heard on a few of iHeartMedia's stations, primarily secondary to its main news talk stations, and usually feature at least one local host with [[Dial Global]] programming; [[Air America Radio]] also aired on these stations. iHeartMedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats (see, for instance, [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]], [[WARF]], [[KLSD]], [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]], and [[WINZ (AM)|WINZ]]); in one case this had caused a protest when iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) wanted to change [[WXXM]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to a sports format. WXXM was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format, though they eventually retired it in November 2016 due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format.\n\niHeartMedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its AM news/talk stations on full-power FM stations, hoping to preserve their long-term viability while AM radio declines. Examples include [[San Diego]], [[California]], on KUSS 95.7 (which became [[KSSX|KOGO-FM]] after simulcasting [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO-AM]], replacing [[country music]]), [[Sacramento, California]] on KGBY 92.5 (which became [[KFBK-FM]] after simulcasting [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]], replacing [[hot adult contemporary]]), in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on KTZR-FM (which became [[KYWD|KNST-FM]] after simulcasting [[KNST]], replacing Spanish top 40), in [[Schenectady, New York]] ([[WGY-FM]]/103.1, simulcasting [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]/810, replacing rock WHRL) and [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WSYR-FM]]/106.9 simulcasting [[WSYR (AM)|WSYR]]/570, displacing urban AC \"Power\" to [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]]/620). After failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves, Clear Channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed KNST-FM to country music in February 2013 as [[KYWD]].\n\n===Sports talk stations===\nMost sports talk stations owned by iHeartMedia are affiliated with [[Fox Sports Radio]]. They are usually branded either ''Fox Sports'' or ''The Sports Animal''. Other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival [[ESPN Radio]] (in this case, [[WUCS]] in Hartford, Connecticut, which is nearby [[ESPN]]'s headquarters in Bristol).\n\n===Adult standards===\nMost of iHeartMedia's adult standards stations are turnkey operations, running a direct feed of a satellite format such as [[Dial Global]]'s [[America's Best Music]] or [[Music of Your Life]]. Most of these stations have no local jocks or Web sites. The network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them.\n\n===Adult contemporary===\niHeartMedia's [[adult contemporary]] stations are often branded as \"Lite FM\" (i.e. [[WLIT]] in Chicago or [[WLTW]] in New York, ) or \"Sunny\", although some stations use \"Magic\", \"B\" or something else similar as their identifiers, As of 2018, \"The Breeze\" has bought a new resurgence in Soft AC, targeted towards millennial listeners. Evenings are usually filled with [[Delilah Rene|Delilah]], unless that show is already aired by another station, in which case the [[John Tesh Radio Show]] is often substituted. Automated programming is the next option for the 7<small>PM</small>- 12 <small>AM</small> timeslot. ''Your Weekend with [[Jim Brickman]]'' and the in-house ''[[American Top 40]] the 1970s (or 1980s) with [[Casey Kasem]]'' are popular weekend syndicated programs on iHeartMedia stations. Most AC stations air [[Christmas music]] from the last week of November to Christmas Day. Some AC iHeartMedia stations are almost famous for playing [[Christmas music]] as early as November 1 such as [[KOSY-FM]] in [[Salt Lake City]] before they flipped to mainstream rock or [[WLKO]] playing its first Christmas song of the season 2\u20133 weeks before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. 2/3 of iHeartMedia stations that play Adult contemporary air Christmas formats.\n\nHot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as \"Mix\", \"Star\" or \"MYfm\" (i.e. [[KBIG]] in Los Angeles). Some Hot AC stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock. Other Hot AC stations have other brandings such as \"Wild 105.7 and 96.7\" on [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n===Contemporary hit radio===\niHeartMedia's CHR stations share a number of common brands, including \"[[KISS-FM (brand)|KISS-FM]]\" (e.g., [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] Los Angeles, [[WKSC-FM]] Chicago, [[WAKS]] Cleveland, [[WFKS]] Melbourne, [[WXKS-FM]] Boston), \"Z\" (e.g., [[WHTZ]] New York, [[KKRZ]] Portland Oregon [[WZFT]] Baltimore, [[KSLZ]] St. Louis), \"Wild\" (e.g., [[WLDI]] West Palm Beach, [[KYLD]] San Francisco), \"Power\" ([[WWPW]] Atlanta, [[WGEX]] Albany, Georgia), Channel (e.g., [[WKQI]] Detroit, [[WHQC]] Charlotte, [[KHTS-FM]] San Diego, [[WCHD]] Dayton-Springfield), or \"Hot\" (e.g., [[WIHT]] in Washington, D.C., [[WWHT]] in Syracuse, NY). Other brands, less commonly used, includes \"Radio Now\" ([[WRNW]] Milwaukee, [[WNRW]] Louisville), \"Q\" ([[WIOQ]] Philadelphia-102.1 FM-Q102, [[WQGA]] Waycross-Brunswick, Georgia-103.3 FM-103Q), \"B\" ([[WAEB-FM]] B 104 Allentown-Reading PA 104.1 FM), \"FM\" ([[WLAN-FM]] FM 97 96.9 FM Lancaster-Reading), \"V\" ([[WVRT]]& [[WVRZ]] V-97 Williamsport-Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), \"Max\" ([[WHCY]] Max 106.3 Sussex), \"K.C.\" ([[WKCI-FM]] KC 101, 101.3 FM, Hamden-New Haven, Connecticut/Long Island, New York) and \"X\" ([[WJMX-FM]] 103X, 103.3 FM Cheraw-Florence, South Carolina/The Pee Dee). Still other branding can be heard, however, when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market.\n\nAlthough a majority of these stations features a broad-based, mass appeal music presentation, several stations like [[WSNX]]/Grand Rapids and [[WKTU]]/New York City tend to lean towards Rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format (WKTU's sister is WHTZ) or a lack of a Rhythmic or R&B/Hip-Hop outlet (a void which WSNX also tries to fill).\n\nMany iHeartMedia CHR stations utilize syndicated morning shows, such as ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' based out of [[WHTZ]], New Jersey/New York's Z100 and ''Johnjay & Rich'' based out of [[KZZP]] Phoenix, Arizona (especially in the Rocky Mountain states). Some East Coast CHR stations carry ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (based out of [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in Los Angeles) middays. On weekends, syndicated programming includes ''[[American Top 40]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\n===Country music===\n[[Country music]] stations owned by iHeartMedia have begun transitioning to \"The Bull\" like [[KSD (FM)]] in St. Louis and \"Big\" like [[WEBG]] in Chicago as national brandings as of 2014. They almost universally carry ''After Midnite'', the syndicated overnight program currently hosted by Cody Alan, and often carry [[Bobby Bones (broadcaster)|Bobby Bones]]'s morning show as well.\n\n===Oldies and classic hits===\niHeartMedia's [[Oldies]] stations consists largely of FM stations with some AM stations. iHeartMedia uses brands such as \"Big\" and \"Kool\" on many of its stations. Nearly all of the FM stations play oldies spanning from 1964 to 1975, with a 500-song active playlist split nearly half 1960s and half 1970s. The playlist also includes approximately a dozen pre 1964 tracks and around 50 songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s. These stations generally have a few local live announcers; much of the time these stations are voicetracked either locally or from another market. Most run syndicated programming on weekends, such as [[Dick Bartley]] or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights, Steve Goddard's programs (''Goddard's Gold'' and/or ''The 70s''), and recently, ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The 70s''. A handful of iHeartMedia's outlets have picked up syndicated weeknight fare, such as Mike Harvey, Marty Thompson or [[Tom Kent]].\n\nThe AM oldies stations' playlists skew somewhat older and span from 1955 to about 1975. About 60 percent of the time they play 1964 to 1969 oldies, 20 percent pre 1964 oldies, and 20 percent music from the 1970s. Some of these also run Dick Bartley or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights. Some of the AM stations also run adult standards several hours on the weekend as well as limited specialized programming focusing on the pre 1964 era. Most of the AM stations are in smaller markets.\n\n===Rock===\niHeartMedia stations programming a rock format tend to play a blend of new rock and harder classic rock. Some carry ''[[Nights with Alice Cooper]]'' in the evenings while some others air ''[[Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx]]''. These stations tend to be live during the day and voicetracked at night. Some stations run ''[[Rockline]]'' with [[Bob Coburn]] and/or ''[[Little Steven's Underground Garage]]'' as well.\n\nWhile iHeartMedia classic rock stations operate under a wide variety of monikers, many are branded as \"[[The Fox (brand)|The Fox]]\" or \"[[The Brew (brand)|The Brew]]\". Often, these stations will carry [[Bob and Tom]] in morning drive. In the [[Southern United States]], ''[[John Boy and Billy]]'' is carried instead in most cases. (Both of the aforementioned shows are syndicated by Premiere.) Other shows include the ''Walton and Johnson Show'' out of Houston and Rover's Morning Glory out of Cleveland. Starting with WQBW Milwaukee (which has since switched to another format) and WBWR Columbus, several iHeartMedia stations have adopted a 1980s-centered classic rock approach called \"The Brew.\"\n\n===Spanish===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has an FM station carrying Hispanic programming full-time. In some markets the format is a Contemporary Tropical format while in others the format carried is more of a Mexican format. In a few markets an iHeartMedia FM station carries a rap based Spanish format known as [[Hurban]], which blends Spanish dance music with rhythm and blues hits as well as some Hip Hop. The division is run by Spanish radio executive [[Alfredo Alonso]], who joined iHeartMedia in September 2004 (when it still was called Clear Channel) as Senior Vice President of Hispanic Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|title=Clear Channel Radio joins pursuit of Hispanic listeners|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|access-date=2017-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040719/http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religious===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has a religious station on the AM band. Some of these sell blocks of time to outside organizations and have no local shows at all except where local churches buy time. These are formatted similarly to [[Salem Media]] stations.\n\nThe other type of religious format iHeartMedia uses in a few markets is a [[Gospel music]] based format. On these stations Gospel Music appealing to black Americans airs most of the time along with some block programming sold to religious groups. These stations are often programmed as urban stations that happen to be religious.\n\n===Specialties===\nIHeartMedia has one station in [[Hawaii]], [[KDNN]]/[[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]], programming a Contemporary Hawaiian Hits/Reggae format, along with an accompanying HD2 sub channel that features traditional Hawaiian music. Multicultural programming can also be heard on AM stations that iHeartMedia owns or has LMAs with. In March 2019, its [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] outlet, [[WSAN]], launched an all-podcast format. In November 2019, [[K256AS]]/[[KUCD]]-HD2 in Honolulu launched a variant Top 40 format with a focus on [[K-pop]] and other international pop hits.\n\n==Syndicated programs==\n: ''See [[List of programming syndicated by iHeartMedia]]''\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Market share===\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company became an object of persistent criticism.<ref>Klinenberg, Eric. ''Fighting For Air: The Battle to Control America's Media''. Metropolitan Books, 2007</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Foege, Alec. ''Right of the Dial: The Rise of Clear Channel and the Fall of Commercial Radio''. Faber and Faber, 2008</ref> FCC regulations were relaxed following the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], allowing companies to own far more radio stations than before. After spending about $30 billion, Clear Channel owned over 1,200 stations nationwide, including as many as eight stations in certain markets. Although \"media reform\" social movement organizations like [[Future of Music Coalition]] mobilized against Clear Channel, so far the company has been able to hold on to all of its stations after divesting a few following the acquisition of AMFM, although over 500 stations have since been sold or are in the process of being sold since the company announced plans to become privately held.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\n{{Main|Clear Channel memorandum}}\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York and [[The Pentagon]], radio stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks. A small list was initially generated by the Clear Channel office on Thursday, September 13, 2001,<ref>In 2001, Jack Evans, regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel, attributed the creation of the list to individual program directors rather than management; however, the completed list was distributed to the program directors by management at Clear Channel.

A list containing about 150 songs was soon published on the [[Internet]]. Some critics suggested that Clear Channel's political preferences played a part in the list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20020405013224/http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-04-05|title=lipmagazine.org|publisher=}}</ref> A number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as \"plane\", \"fly\", \"burn\", and \"falling\" in their titles. Clear Channel denies that this was a list of banned songs, claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought. Also WOFX, Cincinnati, owned by Clear Channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list, even though radio headquarters was in Cincinnati at the time.<ref name=\"CC-PR\">{{cite press release |title=Clear Channel Says National \"Banned Playlist\" Does Not Exist |publisher=Clear Channel Communications, Inc. |date=2001-09-18 |url=http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923200949/http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2002 |access-date=2008-08-03 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Songs on the list included [[Tom Petty]]'s \"[[Free Fallin']]\", [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" and the entire [[Rage Against the Machine discography]].\n\n===Live music recordings===\nIn 2004, Clear Channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing [[Instant Live]] recordings, in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineer's console during the show, and then rapidly burned on [[CD]] so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue. This had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist, venue, and promoter, as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] concert recordings made by audience members. However, some media critics, as well as smaller business rivals, believed that Clear Channel was using the patent (on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks ''during recording'', so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track) to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees, even if they do not use precisely the same process. The patent was transferred to [[Live Nation]] when [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] was spun off, but the patent was revoked on March 13, 2007,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|date=2007-03-13|title=EFF Kills Bogus Clear Channel Patent|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|access-date=2016-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909095922/https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|archive-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for [[Telex Communications|Telex]].\n\n===Indecency zero tolerance===\nDuring the nationwide crackdown on indecent material following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in 2004]], Clear Channel launched a \"self-policing\" effort, and declared that there would be no \"indecent\" material allowed on the air.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> This led to the company's dismissal of several of their own employees, including popular and high-profile hosts in a number of cities. There were protests from free-speech advocates. During the same period, [[Howard Stern]] was dropped from six Clear Channel-owned stations in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky. By mid-year, rival [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through radio division [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]], and the original Viacom, not the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|current one]]) brought Stern's show back to those six markets. In June 2004, Viacom/Infinity Broadcasting Inc./One Twelve Inc. filed a $10 million lawsuit against Clear Channel for breaking of contracts and non-payment of licensing fees due to the dropping of Stern's show. (Viacom was Howard Stern's employer at the time, though he has since moved to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Satellite Radio]].) The following July, Clear Channel filed a countersuit of $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |work=USA Today |title=Clear Channel adopts 'zero-tolerance' indecency policy |date=February 25, 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016060125/http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\nIn the early 2000s, Clear Channel settled a lawsuit with a [[Denver, Colorado]] concert promoter, Nobody In Particular Presents (NIPP).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the lawsuit, NIPP alleged that Clear Channel halted airplay on its local stations for (NIPP) clients, and that Clear Channel would not allow NIPP to publicize its concerts on the air. The lawsuit was settled in 2004 when Clear Channel agreed to pay NIPP a confidential sum.

City officials attempted to contact the local Clear Channel office by telephone to spread warnings of the danger using its radio stations, but it was several critical hours before the station manager was finally reached at his home. In the meantime, [[9-1-1]] operators were advising panicked callers to tune to [[KCJB]] for emergency instructions, but the station was not broadcasting any such information.<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|title=Exclusive... 911 Calls in North Dakota Town Reveal Dangers of Media Consolidation|publisher=Democracy Now|date=25 January 2007|access-date=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206055034/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|archive-date=December 6, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the United States, with one person killed, and over 1,000 seeking medical attention. Clear Channel claimed no responsibility for its failure to warn residents, maintaining that the city should have used the [[Emergency Alert System]] to trigger automatic equipment in place at all U.S. radio stations.

St. Pete Pride has stated that throughout its eight-year history, Clear Channel has edited the organization's advertising material, and questioned whether the rejection of these images were because they displayed same-sex couples in affectionate poses. A Clear Channel spokesperson declined to comment on the specific reasons why the images were rejected but denied that the affection being shown was an issue, saying that such images had been included in previous St. Pete Pride campaigns.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pransky |first=Noah |title=St. Pete Pride gay-themed digital billboards rejected by Clear Channel Outdoor |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |publisher=WTSP |date=2010-06-11 |url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=133980&catid=8 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>\n\n===Censorship===\niHeartMedia and its subsidiaries have been associated with censorship of state and federal candidates for public office, elected officials and various political viewpoints.\n\niHeartMedia has been criticized for censoring opinions critical of [[George W.

[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]], the 2007 release from [[Bruce Springsteen]] which contained songs that were subtly critical of [[George W. Bush]] and his administration, was censored from air play on Clear Channel. Despite that, Springsteen's album still sold very well. After [[Natalie Maines]], the singer of the country band [[Dixie Chicks]], told a London audience that they were \"ashamed [of the fact that] the president of the United States is from Texas\", the band's radio airplay dropped precipitously. Afterwards, some iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) stations removed The Dixie Chicks from their playlists without any noted repercussions from the company. Gail Austin, Clear Channel's director of programming said, \"Out of respect for our troops, our city and our listeners, [we] have taken the Dixie Chicks off our playlists.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/03/17/daily14.html |first=Michael |last=Fitzgerald |title=Dixie Chicks axed by Clear Channel |date=2003-03-18 |access-date=October 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010015435/http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/03/17/daily14.html |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Clear Channel was accused of orchestrating the radio blacklist by such critics as Paul Krugman; however, others claim some Clear Channel stations continued to play the band longer than some other companies.<ref>Gabriel Rossman, \"Elites, Masses, and Media Blacklists: The Dixie Chicks Controversy\", ''Social Forces'': 83 (2004): 61\u201378.</ref>\n\nClear Channel-owned [[KTVX]] was the only local television station that refused to air the paid political message of [[Cindy Sheehan]] against the war in [[Iraq]].<ref>{{Cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=TV station refuses to air anti-war ad days before Bush visit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-20-bush-ad_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-08-20 |access-date=2007-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180633/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-20-bush-ad_x.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn May 8, 2014, the FCC was asked to respond to a political programming complaint, made against an iHeartMedia owned broadcast licensee, Capstar TX LLC by supporters of [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the Democratic candidate for Governor of Wisconsin.

The custom caller service provided by Premiere Radio assures its clients they won't hear the same actor's voice for at least two months in order to appear authentic to listeners who might otherwise catch on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/life-and-religion/58759/radio-daze/|title=Radio Daze|work=Tablet Magazine|access-date=February 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216081007/http://www.tabletmag.com/life-and-religion/58759/radio-daze/|archive-date=February 16, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===iHeartMedia and rock radio===\niHeartMedia has caused controversy with rock music fans in major cities for changing the programming on several longtime rock stations to other formats.

The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.

Earnhardt then weaved to block drivers from overtaking him. On lap 17, Harvick unsuccessfully sought to claim the lead from Earnhardt into turn three. Harvick nonetheless took the lead on the left on the next lap; he received pushing assistance from Kahne and Sadler to keep it until they passed him for first and second on lap 22.

On lap 82, Biffle received drafting assistance from Kyle Busch to overtake Kurt Busch for first place to the inside. Kurt Busch responded by challenging Biffle between laps 83 and 84 but was unable to reclaim the lead. After starting towards the rear of the field, Gordon moved to third by the 86th lap.

Earnhardt then weaved to block drivers from overtaking him. On lap 17, Harvick unsuccessfully sought to claim the lead from Earnhardt into turn three. Harvick nonetheless took the lead on the left on the next lap; he received pushing assistance from Kahne and Sadler to keep it until they passed him for first and second on lap 22. On the next lap, Harvick returned to the lead as Kahne lost the [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]] and lost positions. By lap 26, Kurt Busch had moved to second place.

Allmendinger turned left on lap 72, and Harvick overtook him to reclaim the lead. However, Allemdinger returned to the lead on lap 73 when cars on the left were faster than those on the right. Four laps later, Bliss spun on the backstretch, damaging his car's rear left, and triggering the third caution.<ref name=\"FoxD500RaceTrax\" /><ref name=\"LapByLap\" />\n\nDuring the caution, the leaders made pit stops for fuel, tires and car adjustments. Allmendinger lost the lead since one of his crew members dropped a [[lug nut]]. Hamlin staggered his pit stop, allowing him to lead one lap. Kurt Busch reclaimed the lead, and led at the restart on lap 81, followed by Biffle and Kyle Busch. On lap 82, Biffle received drafting assistance from Kyle Busch to overtake Kurt Busch for first place to the inside. Kurt Busch responded by challenging Biffle between laps 83 and 84 but was unable to reclaim the lead. After starting towards the rear of the field, Gordon moved to third by the 86th lap. On lap 95, Kyle Busch passed Biffle on the right to become the new leader. Soon after, Gordon passed Biffle for second.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the European population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The city of [[Vannes]] in Brittany changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}  The English-backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking the duchy but not until 1364.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |title=Auray, France |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2018-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415064637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |archive-date=15 April 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and the taking of Calais===\n[[File:Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], 1346, from the [[Grandes Chroniques de France]].

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of N\u00e1jera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}} In 1372 the Castilian fleet defeated the English fleet in the [[Battle of La Rochelle]].\n\n===1373 campaign of John of Gaunt===\n\nIn August 1373, [[John of Gaunt]], accompanied by [[John V, Duke of Brittany|John de Montfort]], Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men from Calais on a {{lang|fr|chevauch\u00e9e}}. While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\n\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}} Richard's indifference to the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|one of his uncles]]. This group, known as [[Lords Appellant]], managed to press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the [[Merciless Parliament]]. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of the three-year [[Truce of Leulinghem]].{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, [[John of Gaunt]], returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]].

A conflict for control over the Regency began between his uncle [[Philip the Bold]], Duke of Burgundy and his brother, [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]. After Philip's death, his son and heir [[John the Fearless]] continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====\n{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}\n\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]].

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nSome [[historian]]s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a [[periodisation]] to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815.<ref>Buffinton, Arthur H.

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).<ref name=webster39/>\n\n[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.{{sfn|Ladurie|1987|p=[{{google books|VT9rIMQFt2MC|pg=PA32|plainurl=yes}} 32]}} The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===Military significance===\n\nIn 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\" /><ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the European population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of N\u00e1jera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369.

While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\n\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}} Richard's indifference to the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|one of his uncles]]. This group, known as [[Lords Appellant]], managed to press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the [[Merciless Parliament]]. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of the three-year [[Truce of Leulinghem]].{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, [[John of Gaunt]], returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]].

After Philip's death, his son and heir [[John the Fearless]] continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====\n{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}\n\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]].

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nSome [[historian]]s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a [[periodisation]] to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815.<ref>Buffinton, Arthur H.

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).<ref name=webster39/>\n\n[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.{{sfn|Ladurie|1987|p=[{{google books|VT9rIMQFt2MC|pg=PA32|plainurl=yes}} 32]}} The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===Military significance===\n\nIn 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\" /><ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound.
