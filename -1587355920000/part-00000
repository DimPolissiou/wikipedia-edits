{"title_page": "Transgenerational trauma", "text_new": "'''Transgenerational trauma''', or '''intergenerational trauma''' is a psychological [[scientific theory|theory]] which suggests that trauma can be transferred in between generations. After a first generation of survivors experiences trauma, they are able to transfer their trauma to their children and further generations of offspring via ''[[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]'' mechanisms.

However, it may also be epigenetically transferred. [[Epigenetics]] studies how gene expression and cellular activity is influenced by external factors such as environment. A vastly researched event of epigenetics modifying genes within generations is the [[Dutch Hunger Winter Syndrome|Dutch Hunger Winter Famine]]. Those directly experiencing the famine suppressed specific genes and expressed other ones that aided in survival. When the survivors had offspring, their children also had the same genes suppressed and/or expressed. Therefore, one way trauma can be transferred is through epigenetics. Furthermore, when a child is raised in the same environment as their ancestors, it can trigger the reformation of a gene in each generation; this is the most indirect form of epigenetic imprinting.\nThe epigenome may also be passed through the gametes. For this to occur, the epigenome must be present in the [[germline]]. The epigenome is also extensively reprogrammed during germ cell differentiation and after fertilization to create [[Cell potency|totipotent]] cells, erasing many changes that occur during an individual's lifetime.<ref name=\"pmid11498579\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reik W, Dean W, Walter J | title = Epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian development | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5532 | pages = 1089\u201393 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11498579 | doi = 10.1126/science.1063443 }}</ref> Therefore, the best candidates for heritable epigenetic marks are located at [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat]]/[[Transposable element|transposable]] sequences or [[Regulator gene|regulatory elements]] that are resistant to reprogramming.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blake GE, Watson ED | title = Unravelling the complex mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 33 | issue =  | pages = 101\u20137 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27327212 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.06.008 | url = https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256643 }}</ref> Since epigenetic mechanisms can be affected by the environment, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the environment and direct inheritance influence offsprings' epigenome. Therefore, the most compelling studies are in lab settings with controlled environments.\n\n[[Non-coding RNA]] is currently one of the most investigated epigenetic mechanisms in the study of transgenerational trauma. Small ncRNAs guide DNA/ [[histone methylation]] and post-transcriptionally regulate [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]].<ref name=\"pmid20143452\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Choudhuri S | title = Small noncoding RNAs: biogenesis, function, and emerging significance in toxicology | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Molecular Toxicology | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 195\u2013216 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20143452 | doi = 10.1002/jbt.20325 }}</ref> In ''C. elegans'', starvation-induced stress triggered the expression of small RNAs that cause gene silencing and persist for several generations.

[[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) is the form of methylated DNA linked to gene repression in mammals, and [[N6-Methyladenosine]]<nowiki/>is linked to promotion of gene activity.

These discrepancies may be due to method of methylation analysis used or due to variations in the epigenome between individuals.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that [[histone]] modifications may also be inherited across generations. Histones tend to be preserved at housekeeping sites and developmentally regulated genes in sperm and are preserved everywhere in oocytes.<ref name=\":0\" /> \nAlthough it isn't confirmed, if changes in the histone modification machinery were to cause phenotypic changes, a second epigenetic mechanism may be involved.\n\n=== Transmission during pregnancy ===\n\nAnother major way that stress can be transmitted across generations biologically is through the [[Uterus|uterine]] environment. The [[gestation]]al stage is a developmentally sensitive stage in an individual's lifespan. Exposure to harmful stimuli during this stage can have long-lasting, detrimental effects.<ref name=\"Kinsella_2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinsella MT, Monk C | title = Impact of maternal stress, depression and anxiety on fetal neurobehavioral development | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 425\u201340 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19661759 | pmc = 3710585 | doi = 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52df1 }}</ref> The uterine environment with its unique blend of the mother's cellular secretions and proteins is a major source of stimuli.<ref name=\":3\" /> Empirical evidence has shown that trauma experienced by a mother during pregnancy can affect offspring's physiology and psychology.<ref name=\"Yehuda_2018\" /> One possible method of transmission is through transport [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] transferring [[amino acid]]s and microRNA from the uterine fluid to the fetus.<ref name=\"Kinsella_2009\" /> These molecules may then alter gene expression in a way that affects the developmental trajectory of the fetus. Most biological research on transgenerational trauma has focused on the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA) axis, which is the center of the body's stress response system. One way the HPA axis responds to stress is by triggering the production of glucocorticoids, primarily [[cortisol]].<ref name=\"Yehuda_2018\" /> Cortisol triggers \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d physiological symptoms like increased blood pressure and heart rate. In animal models, maternal stress and trauma during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the expression of placental enzyme 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 \u03b2-HSD2), which converts the mother's cortisol to inactive cortisone. This leads to increased fetal exposure to the mother's glucocorticoids, which affects the development of glucocorticoid-sensitive systems like the HPA axis.  In some studies, abnormal cortisol levels compared to controls and alterations in DNA methylation were observed in infants of mothers who endured trauma while pregnant, particularly in the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor gene.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170622121913.htm|title=The biology of uterine fluid: How it informs the fetus of mom's world |date=June 22, 2017|work=Science News }}</ref>\n\n===Psychological and social aspects===\n\nThere are many current transgenerational studies that have been done on adults that have experienced natural disasters or adversities.

However, it may also be epigenetically transferred. [[Epigenetics]] studies how gene expression and cellular activity is influenced by external factors such as environment. A vastly researched event of epigenetics modifying genes within generations is the [[Dutch Hunger Winter Syndrome|Dutch Hunger Winter Famine]]. Those directly experiencing the famine suppressed specific genes and expressed other ones that aided in survival. When the survivors had offspring, their children also had the same genes suppressed and/or expressed. Therefore, one way trauma can be transferred is through epigenetics. Furthermore, when a child is raised in the same environment as their ancestors, it can trigger the reformation of a gene in each generation; this is the most indirect form of epigenetic imprinting.\nThe epigenome may also be passed through the gametes. For this to occur, the epigenome must be present in the [[germline]].

[[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) is the form of methylated DNA linked to gene repression in mammals, and [[N6-Methyladenosine]]<nowiki/>is linked to promotion of gene activity. Various empirical studies have shown that trauma alters methylation patterns in the offspring of survivors, predominantly at the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (NR3C1) gene.<ref name=\"Yehuda_2018\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yehuda R, Lehrner A | title = Intergenerational transmission of trauma effects: putative role of epigenetic mechanisms | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 243\u2013257 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30192087 | pmc = 6127768 | doi = 10.1002/wps.20568 }}</ref> For DNA methylation to be inherited, it has to be stable enough to undergo mitosis and meiosis, and it must escape the aforementioned epigenetic reprogramming. 5mc at repeat sequences and rare regulatory elements are resistant to reprogramming.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, it has been hard to find methylated regions that are stable over multiple generations, and there have been a lot of discrepancies across studies. These discrepancies may be due to method of methylation analysis used or due to variations in the epigenome between individuals.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that [[histone]] modifications may also be inherited across generations. Histones tend to be preserved at housekeeping sites and developmentally regulated genes in sperm and are preserved everywhere in oocytes.<ref name=\":0\" /> \nAlthough it isn't confirmed, if changes in the histone modification machinery were to cause phenotypic changes, a second epigenetic mechanism may be involved.\n\n=== Transmission during pregnancy ===\n\nAnother major way that stress can be transmitted across generations biologically is through the [[Uterus|uterine]] environment. The [[gestation]]al stage is a developmentally sensitive stage in an individual's lifespan. Exposure to harmful stimuli during this stage can have long-lasting, detrimental effects.<ref name=\"Kinsella_2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinsella MT, Monk C | title = Impact of maternal stress, depression and anxiety on fetal neurobehavioral development | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 425\u201340 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19661759 | pmc = 3710585 | doi = 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52df1 }}</ref> The uterine environment with its unique blend of the mother's cellular secretions and proteins is a major source of stimuli.<ref name=\":3\" /> Empirical evidence has shown that trauma experienced by a mother during pregnancy can affect offspring's physiology and psychology.<ref name=\"Yehuda_2018\" /> One possible method of transmission is through transport [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] transferring [[amino acid]]s and microRNA from the uterine fluid to the fetus.<ref name=\"Kinsella_2009\" /> These molecules may then alter gene expression in a way that affects the developmental trajectory of the fetus. Most biological research on transgenerational trauma has focused on the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA) axis, which is the center of the body's stress response system. One way the HPA axis responds to stress is by triggering the production of glucocorticoids, primarily [[cortisol]].<ref name=\"Yehuda_2018\" /> Cortisol triggers \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d physiological symptoms like increased blood pressure and heart rate. In animal models, maternal stress and trauma during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the expression of placental enzyme 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 \u03b2-HSD2), which converts the mother's cortisol to inactive cortisone. This leads to increased fetal exposure to the mother's glucocorticoids, which affects the development of glucocorticoid-sensitive systems like the HPA axis.  In some studies, abnormal cortisol levels compared to controls and alterations in DNA methylation were observed in infants of mothers who endured trauma while pregnant, particularly in the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor gene.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170622121913.htm|title=The biology of uterine fluid: How it informs the fetus of mom's world |date=June 22, 2017|work=Science News }}</ref>\n\n===Psychological and social aspects===\n\nThere are many current transgenerational studies that have been done on adults that have experienced natural disasters or adversities.

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

With both teams ranked in the top ten of both major college football polls, [[ESPN]] had chosen [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as the host of [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]. This was Wisconsin's second appearance on GameDay for 2016 and Ohio State's first. Ohio State extended their current win streak over the Badgers to five, dating back to 2011. Ohio State coach [[Urban Meyer]] is 4\u20130 versus Wisconsin and this was Badgers' coach [[Paul Chryst]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes started the game off slow by gaining only 23 yards on their first two drives, both resulting in punts, while allowing 147 yards for the Badger's offense on their first two drives that resulted in a ten-point lead for #8 Wisconsin. Neither team could find the endzone for the remainder of the first half and both settled for two additional field goals apiece for a halftime score of 16\u20136 favoring the Badgers.\n\nThe Silver Bullet Buckeye defense came out strong in the second half forcing two Wisconsin turnovers and a three-and-out, on Wisconsin's first three possessions. Though the Buckeyes threw an interception on their first possession, they followed it up with two consecutive touchdowns, both [[J. T. Barrett]] runs. On Barrett's second touchdown, Ohio State took their first lead of the night at the 14:09 mark of the fourth quarter, and the Buckeyes led 20\u201316. The next drive, Wisconsin drove 81 yards to take back the lead with 7:54 left in the game. The Buckeyes followed that score with a field goal to tie the game at 23 with 3:57 to go. The Badger offense drove 25 yards on their last possession, but come up short of field goal range and had to punt to the Buckeyes with 0:14 left. The Buckeyes with the ball on their 17-yard line decided to run out the clock and force overtime.\n\nOhio State would get the ball first in overtime and would score a touchdown on a [[J. T. Barrett]] pass to Noah Brown on third and two from the Wisconsin 7, which gave them a 30\u201323 lead. On Wisconsin's attempt, quarterback Alex Hornibrook would throw a 21-yard pass on Wisconsin's second play which got the Badgers to the Ohio State 4. After two [[Corey Clement]] runs for no gain and an incomplete pass, the game came down to a fourth and goal from the Ohio State four. Wisconsin opted for a pass and Hornibrook was sacked by [[Tyquan Lewis]] to preserve Ohio State's unbeaten status.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led by Barrett who had 226 yards passing and 92 yards rushing and three total touchdowns (two rushing, one passing). Barrett was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his 318 total yard performance.<ref name=\"btn.com\">http://btn.com/2016/10/17/check-out-who-won-week-7-big-ten-football-honors/</ref> He was also named  Davey O\u2019Brien National Quarterback of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101816aae.html|title=J.T.

Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime.

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

Ohio State struck first, midway through the first quarter on a [[Curtis Samuel]] 36-yard touchdown run. On Oklahoma's next possession, Ohio State's Jerome Baker intercepted [[Baker Mayfield]]'s pass to score a touchdown on a 68-yard interception return. This was Ohio State's fourth defensive score in their first three games. During the ensuing kickoff, Oklahoma's Joe Mixon returned the kick for a 97-yard touchdown, to make the score 14\u20137, Ohio State. Though not caught, Mixon dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line and fumbled into the end zone. Ohio State scored another two touchdowns and Oklahoma made a field goal to make the score 28\u201310. With six minutes to go in the half, Oklahoma scored on a 35-yard Mayfield pass to A.D.

With both teams ranked in the top ten of both major college football polls, [[ESPN]] had chosen [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as the host of [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]. This was Wisconsin's second appearance on GameDay for 2016 and Ohio State's first. Ohio State extended their current win streak over the Badgers to five, dating back to 2011. Ohio State coach [[Urban Meyer]] is 4\u20130 versus Wisconsin and this was Badgers' coach [[Paul Chryst]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes started the game off slow by gaining only 23 yards on their first two drives, both resulting in punts, while allowing 147 yards for the Badger's offense on their first two drives that resulted in a ten-point lead for #8 Wisconsin. Neither team could find the endzone for the remainder of the first half and both settled for two additional field goals apiece for a halftime score of 16\u20136 favoring the Badgers.\n\nThe Silver Bullet Buckeye defense came out strong in the second half forcing two Wisconsin turnovers and a three-and-out, on Wisconsin's first three possessions. Though the Buckeyes threw an interception on their first possession, they followed it up with two consecutive touchdowns, both [[J. T. Barrett]] runs. On Barrett's second touchdown, Ohio State took their first lead of the night at the 14:09 mark of the fourth quarter, and the Buckeyes led 20\u201316. The next drive, Wisconsin drove 81 yards to take back the lead with 7:54 left in the game. The Buckeyes followed that score with a field goal to tie the game at 23 with 3:57 to go. The Badger offense drove 25 yards on their last possession, but come up short of field goal range and had to punt to the Buckeyes with 0:14 left. The Buckeyes with the ball on their 17-yard line decided to run out the clock and force overtime.\n\nOhio State would get the ball first in overtime and would score a touchdown on a [[J. T. Barrett]] pass to Noah Brown on third and two from the Wisconsin 7, which gave them a 30\u201323 lead. On Wisconsin's attempt, quarterback Alex Hornibrook would throw a 21-yard pass on Wisconsin's second play which got the Badgers to the Ohio State 4. After two [[Corey Clement]] runs for no gain and an incomplete pass, the game came down to a fourth and goal from the Ohio State four. Wisconsin opted for a pass and Hornibrook was sacked by [[Tyquan Lewis]] to preserve Ohio State's unbeaten status.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led by Barrett who had 226 yards passing and 92 yards rushing and three total touchdowns (two rushing, one passing).

The next score came from Michigan State on a 1-yard LJ Scott run. The Spartans opted to go for a two-point conversion with only 4:41 left in the game to attempt to take the lead. Tyler O'Connor's pass was intercepted in the end zone and the Buckeyes maintained the lead, 17\u201316. Ohio State got the ball back and ran 2:37 off the clock on six plays, but punted with 2:04 left in the game. Tyler O'Connor was sacked on the first play by Tyquan Lewis for a loss of ten yards, the following play, Gareon Conley intercepted O'Connor's pass to seal the Buckeyes' 17\u201316 victory.\n\nMike Weber was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week for his performance and for the second time this season.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MSU\n|-\n|Total yards\n|310\n|334\n|-\n|Passing yards\n|86\n|127\n|-\n|Rushing yards\n|224\n|207\n|-\n|Penalties\n|4\u201340\n|6\u201360\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|Time of possession\n|30:53\n|29:07\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MSU\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State. The game marked the 11th time that Michigan and Ohio State took the field both in the nation's top-five rankings; and is just the second time that both programs were ranked in the nation's top three. The other was the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in [[2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|2006]] at Ohio Stadium. The game also marked the first overtime in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry. Michigan's defense recorded a season-best eight sacks against Ohio State.

Darboh caught eight passes for 68 receiving yards, upping his career total to 2,026. Darboh has recorded a reception in 32 consecutive games, earning a share of the fourth spot among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category. He is tied with [[Marquise Walker]] (1998\u20132001).<ref name=OhioStateNotes/>\n\n[[Raekwon McMillan]] was named the conference Defensive Player of the Week for his performance.
