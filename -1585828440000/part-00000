A native of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Yorkshire]], he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] (1784\u20131812). In 1785, he became an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.\n\nIn 1787, he came into contact with [[Thomas Clarkson]] and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including [[Granville Sharp]], [[Hannah More]] and [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Charles Middleton]]. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]].\n\nWilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in [[Sierra Leone]], the foundation of the [[Church Mission Society]], and the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.<!-- Note: Per WP:LEDE, the lead paragraph needs to summarize the article; this point is well referenced and discussed in the body of the article. -->\n\nIn later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], which abolished slavery in most of the [[British Empire]]. Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], close to his friend [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWilberforce was born in a [[Wilberforce House|house]] on the High Street of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 24 August 1759, the only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728\u20131768), a wealthy merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Bird (1730\u20131798).

1833)<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> was a British politician, [[philanthropist]], and a leader of the movement to abolish the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]].  A native of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Yorkshire]], he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] (1784\u20131812). In 1785, he became an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.\n\nIn 1787, he came into contact with [[Thomas Clarkson]] and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including [[Granville Sharp]], [[Hannah More]] and [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Charles Middleton]]. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]].\n\nWilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in [[Sierra Leone]], the foundation of the [[Church Mission Society]], and the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.<!-- Note: Per WP:LEDE, the lead paragraph needs to summarize the article; this point is well referenced and discussed in the body of the article. -->\n\nIn later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], which abolished slavery in most of the [[British Empire]]. Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], close to his friend [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWilberforce was born in a [[Wilberforce House|house]] on the High Street of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 24 August 1759, the only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728\u20131768), a wealthy merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Bird (1730\u20131798).

The writer and socialite [[Anne Louise Germaine de Sta\u00ebl|Madame de Sta\u00ebl]] described him as the \"wittiest man in England\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hochschild|2005|pp=125\u201326}}</ref> and, according to [[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]], the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] said that he would go anywhere to hear Wilberforce sing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pollock|1977|p=15}}</ref><ref name =Life/>\n\nWilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches; the diarist and author [[James Boswell]] witnessed Wilberforce's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted, \"I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; but as I listened, he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale.\"<ref name=\"titleSickly shrimp of a man who sank the slave ships \u2013 Times Online\">{{citation|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article1563804.ece |title=Sickly shrimp of a man who sank the slave ships|accessdate=27 November 2007 |date= 25 March 2005 |work = [[The Sunday Times]] | location=London|publisher=The Times}}</ref> during the frequent government changes of 1781\u20131784, Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=44\u201352}}</ref>\n\nIn autumn 1783, Pitt, Wilberforce and [[Edward James Eliot|Edward Eliot]] (later to become Pitt's brother-in-law), travelled to France for a six-week holiday together.<ref name= ODNB/><ref name=\"Harvnb1\">{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=53\u201355}}</ref> After a difficult start in [[Rheims]], where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were English spies, they visited Paris, meeting [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], [[Marie Antoinette]] and [[Louis XVI]], and joined the French court at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]].<ref name=\"Harvnb1\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Pollock|1977|p=23}}</ref>\n\nPitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key supporter of his [[minority administration|minority government]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pollock|1977|pp=23\u201324}}</ref> Despite their close friendship, there is no record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a [[Minister (government)|ministerial position]] in this or future governments.

Wilberforce never sought office and was never offered one.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=52\u201353, 59}}</ref> When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] in the [[1784 British general election|1784 general election]].<ref name= ODNB/> On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pollock|1977|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==Conversion==\nIn October 1784, Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career. He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of [[Isaac Milner]], the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster, who had been [[Fellow]] of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], in the year when Wilberforce first went up. They visited the [[French Riviera]] and enjoyed the usual pastimes of dinners, cards, and gambling.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=70\u201372}}</ref> In February 1785, Wilberforce returned to London temporarily, to support Pitt's proposals for parliamentary reforms.

This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting family members and friends.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|p=494}}</ref> He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkins|2007|p=213}}</ref>\n\nWilberforce approved of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though he was concerned about the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the [[Reform Act 1832]] was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the [[Baptist War|1832 slave revolt]] in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|p=498}}</ref>\nIn 1833, Wilberforce's health declined further and he suffered a severe attack of [[influenza]] from which he never fully recovered.<ref name=ODNB/> He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in [[Maidstone]], Kent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkins|2007|p=217}}</ref> The following month, the Whig government introduced the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Bill for the Abolition of Slavery]], formally saluting Wilberforce in the process.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=498\u2013499}}</ref> On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|p=502}}</ref> The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin's house in [[Cadogan Place]], London.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pollock|1977|p=308}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref>\n\nOne month later, the House of Lords passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]], which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire from August 1834.<ref>The legislation specifically excluded the territories of the [[Honourable East India Company]] which were not then under direct Crown control.</ref> They voted plantation owners \u00a320&nbsp;million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of [[Indentured servant|apprenticeship]] requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, British Honduras and Canada.

However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The family agreed and, on 3 August 1833, Wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend [[William Pitt the Younger]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hague|2007|p=304}}</ref> The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament, as well as by members of the public.

The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of [[Thomas Clarkson]]. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement to write a book refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography.<ref>{{Citation| last = Clarkson  | first = Thomas  | author-link = Thomas Clarkson  | title = Strictures on a Life of William Wilberforce, by the Rev.

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers. [[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]] avoided relegation by winning the promotion/relegation play-off against [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen Lions]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne |caption=Locations of 2020 NPL Victoria clubs within metropolitan Melbourne\n| width = 380\n| places =\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Avondale FC|Avondale]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7626|S|144.8583|E}} }}\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Altona Magic SC|Altona]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|50|48|S|144|51|25|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Bentleigh Greens|Bentleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|58|7|S|145|5|27|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|43|27|S|144|49|8|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|44|23|S|145|2|3|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Hume City FC|Hume]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|39|55|S|144|54|58|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Melbourne Knights FC|Knights]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|45|44|S|144|50|43|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Oakleigh Cannons FC|Oakleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|54|22|S|145|5|55|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.8585318|S|145.0983669|E}} }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7330618|S|144.8119635|E}}  }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Port Melbourne SC|Port Melbourne]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|49|59.92|S|144|55|44.17|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|38.0023|S|145.2092|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong City SC|Dandenong City]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37.9599|S|145.2377|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|50|25|S|144|57|54|E}} }}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers.

R. Smith]]]]\n'''William Twaits''' (25 April 1781 &ndash; 22 August 1814) was a British singer, dancer and [[actor-manager]] whose career was mostly in the United States in the early 19th-century.<ref name=Biog>Philip H. Highfill, Kalman A. Burnim and Edward A. Langhans, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TGgS9VxWJ0oC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq ''A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stager Personnel in London 1660-1800''], Vol. 15 Tibbett to M. West, Southern Illinois University Press (1993) - Google Books pg. 62-63</ref>\n\n[[William Dunlap]], in his ''History of the American Theatre'' (1832) wrote of Twaits:\n<blockquote>\n'Mr. Twaits was born on the 25th of April 1781. His father died when he was very young, and he obtained admittance behind the scenes at Drury-lane, through the influence of a playmate, the son of Phillemore (John Phillemore), one of the performers. Having determined to be an actor, he stuck to the point, as ([[George Colman the Younger|George]]) Colman (the younger) says, \"like a rusty weather-cock\", and we suppose , like most of our heroes, ran away. He commenced acting at a place called [[Waltham Abbey]]\u2026 [he was] Short and thin, yet appearing broad; muscular yet meagre; a large head, with stiff, stubborn, carroty hair; long, colourless face, prominent hooked nose, projecting large hazel eyes, thin lips, and large mouth, which could be twisted into a variety of expression, and which, combining with his other features, eminently served the purposes of the comic muse - such was [his] physiognomy...'<ref name=Biog/>   \n</blockquote>\n\nDunlap does not mention whether Twaits had any experience of acting in London, but ''The London Stage'' mentions two performances, separated by a year, held at Wheatley's Riding School in [[Greenwich]]. On 8 June 1798 he was among nine provincial actors who appeared in a benefit for five of them. Twaits played Glenalvon in ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' and Tom Tug in ''The Waterman'' and also sang between the acts. On 17 May 1799 Twaits and some of the actors from June 1789 were back at Wheatley's in Greenwich where they performed ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (during which Twaits as [[Tony Lumpkin]] sang \"a song in character\") and ''[[The Agreeable Surprise]]''. Next Twaits appeared in the Midlands, where according to [[William Dunlap|Dunlap]]:<ref name=Biog/> \n<blockquote>\n'he had been the [[Richard III (play)|Richard]] and [[Romeo]] of many a barn, when he had the promise of the highest salary in the company, nine shillings per week, and was obliged to be content with two-and-sixpence; when he feasted upon a hog's heart and vegetables (cost ninepence, baking a penny} for a week...\"\n</blockquote>\n\nTwaits was not given the opportunity to appear at any of the regular London theatres even though [[William B.

West, Southern Illinois University Press (1993) - Google Books pg. 62-63</ref>\n\n[[William Dunlap]], in his ''History of the American Theatre'' (1832) wrote of Twaits:\n<blockquote>\n'Mr. Twaits was born on the 25th of April 1781. His father died when he was very young, and he obtained admittance behind the scenes at Drury-lane, through the influence of a playmate, the son of Phillemore (John Phillemore), one of the performers. Having determined to be an actor, he stuck to the point, as ([[George Colman the Younger|George]]) Colman (the younger) says, \"like a rusty weather-cock\", and we suppose , like most of our heroes, ran away. He commenced acting at a place called [[Waltham Abbey]]\u2026 [he was] Short and thin, yet appearing broad; muscular yet meagre; a large head, with stiff, stubborn, carroty hair; long, colourless face, prominent hooked nose, projecting large hazel eyes, thin lips, and large mouth, which could be twisted into a variety of expression, and which, combining with his other features, eminently served the purposes of the comic muse - such was [his] physiognomy...'<ref name=Biog/>   \n</blockquote>\n\nDunlap does not mention whether Twaits had any experience of acting in London, but ''The London Stage'' mentions two performances, separated by a year, held at Wheatley's Riding School in [[Greenwich]]. On 8 June 1798 he was among nine provincial actors who appeared in a benefit for five of them. Twaits played Glenalvon in ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' and Tom Tug in ''The Waterman'' and also sang between the acts. On 17 May 1799 Twaits and some of the actors from June 1789 were back at Wheatley's in Greenwich where they performed ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (during which Twaits as [[Tony Lumpkin]] sang \"a song in character\") and ''[[The Agreeable Surprise]]''. Next Twaits appeared in the Midlands, where according to [[William Dunlap|Dunlap]]:<ref name=Biog/> \n<blockquote>\n'he had been the [[Richard III (play)|Richard]] and [[Romeo]] of many a barn, when he had the promise of the highest salary in the company, nine shillings per week, and was obliged to be content with two-and-sixpence; when he feasted upon a hog's heart and vegetables (cost ninepence, baking a penny} for a week...\"\n</blockquote>\n\nTwaits was not given the opportunity to appear at any of the regular London theatres even though [[William B. Wood (actor)|William B. Wood]] 'considered [him] one of the the best [[burletta]] singers in England'. While performing for [[William Macready the Elder|Macready]] (the Elder) in [[Birmingham]] Wood persuaded Twaits to join his theatrical company in [[Philadelphia]] at a salary of four [[guinea]]s a week.
