[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center. Retrieved 2 July 2011</ref> During the follicular phase, [[estradiol]] suppresses release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}</ref>\n\nThe exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{vcite book |last=Lentz | first=Gretchen M |last2=Lobo | first2=Rogerio A. |last3=Gershenson | first3=David M |last4=Katz | first4=Vern L. |title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.<ref name=Lentz /> This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}</ref>\n\nThe exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{vcite book |last=Lentz | first=Gretchen M |last2=Lobo | first2=Rogerio A. |last3=Gershenson | first3=David M |last4=Katz | first4=Vern L. |title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.<ref name=Lentz /> This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\nFertilization by a [[spermatozoon]], when it occurs, usually takes place in the [[Ampulla of uterine tube|ampulla]], the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> It has usually reached the [[blastocyst]] stage at the time of implantation.\n\nIn some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called ''[[mittelschmerz]]'' (German term meaning ''middle pain'').<ref name=allmenses/> The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.65</ref>\n\n==== Luteal phase ====\n{{main|Luteal phase}}\nThe luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n=== Uterine cycle ===\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.<ref>{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editor=Guyton AC |editor2=Hall JE |publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}</ref>\n\n==== Menstruation ====\n{{main|Menstruation}}\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle.

Left an orphan at eighteen, with an estate heavily encumbered, he was by special decree of the grand duke of Tuscany declared of age and entrusted with the guardianship of his younger brothers. Interrupting his studies, he withdrew to [[Brolio]], and by careful management disencumbered the family possessions. In 1847 he founded the journal ''La Patria'', and addressed to the grand duke a memorial suggesting remedies for the difficulties of the state. In 1848 he was elected ''Gonfaloniere'' of [[Florence]], but resigned on account of the anti-Liberal tendencies of the grand duke.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Ricasoli, Bettino, Baron |volume=23 |pages=287\u2013288 |first=Henry Wickham |last=Steed |authorlink=Wickham Steed}} Endnotes:\n*Tabarrini and Gotti, ''Lettere e documenti del barone Bettino Ricasoli'', 10 vols.

Elected Italian deputy in 1861, he succeeded [[Camillo Benso conte di Cavour|Cavour]] in the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|premiership]]. As premier he admitted the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldian]] volunteers to the regular army, revoked the decree of exile against [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]], and attempted reconciliation with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]; but his efforts were rendered ineffectual by the ''[[non possumus]]'' of the pope.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDisdainful of the intrigues of his rival [[Urbano Rattazzi|Rattazzi]], he found himself obliged in 1862 to resign office, but returned to power in 1866. On this occasion he refused [[Napoleon III]]'s offer to cede [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to Italy, on condition that Italy should abandon the [[Prussia]]n alliance, and also refused the Prussian decoration of the Black Eagle because [[Alfonso Ferrero la Marmora|La Marmora]], author of the alliance, was not to receive it.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nUpon the departure of the French troops from Rome at the end of 1866 he again attempted to conciliate the Vatican with a convention, in virtue of which Italy would have restored to the Church the property of the suppressed religious orders in return for the gradual payment of 24,000,000. In order to mollify the Vatican he conceded the [[exequatur]] to forty-five bishops inimical to the Italian r\u00e9gime. The Vatican accepted his proposal, but the Italian Chamber proved refractory, and, though dissolved by Ricasoli, returned more hostile than before.

Left an orphan at eighteen, with an estate heavily encumbered, he was by special decree of the grand duke of Tuscany declared of age and entrusted with the guardianship of his younger brothers. Interrupting his studies, he withdrew to [[Brolio]], and by careful management disencumbered the family possessions. In 1847 he founded the journal ''La Patria'', and addressed to the grand duke a memorial suggesting remedies for the difficulties of the state. In 1848 he was elected ''Gonfaloniere'' of [[Florence]], but resigned on account of the anti-Liberal tendencies of the grand duke.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Ricasoli, Bettino, Baron |volume=23 |pages=287\u2013288 |first=Henry Wickham |last=Steed |authorlink=Wickham Steed}} Endnotes:\n*Tabarrini and Gotti, ''Lettere e documenti del barone Bettino Ricasoli'', 10 vols.

Elected Italian deputy in 1861, he succeeded [[Camillo Benso conte di Cavour|Cavour]] in the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|premiership]]. As premier he admitted the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldian]] volunteers to the regular army, revoked the decree of exile against [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]], and attempted reconciliation with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]; but his efforts were rendered ineffectual by the ''[[non possumus]]'' of the pope.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDisdainful of the intrigues of his rival [[Urbano Rattazzi|Rattazzi]], he found himself obliged in 1862 to resign office, but returned to power in 1866. On this occasion he refused [[Napoleon III]]'s offer to cede [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to Italy, on condition that Italy should abandon the [[Prussia]]n alliance, and also refused the Prussian decoration of the Black Eagle because [[Alfonso Ferrero la Marmora|La Marmora]], author of the alliance, was not to receive it.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nUpon the departure of the French troops from Rome at the end of 1866 he again attempted to conciliate the Vatican with a convention, in virtue of which Italy would have restored to the Church the property of the suppressed religious orders in return for the gradual payment of 24,000,000. In order to mollify the Vatican he conceded the [[exequatur]] to forty-five bishops inimical to the Italian r\u00e9gime. The Vatican accepted his proposal, but the Italian Chamber proved refractory, and, though dissolved by Ricasoli, returned more hostile than before. Without waiting for a vote, Ricasoli resigned office and thenceforward practically disappeared from political life, speaking in the Chamber only upon rare occasions.

Four playable character classes are available in the base game, each with their own unique abilities and [[skill tree]]s: Axton, \"the Commando\", can summon a [[turret]] to provide offensive support. Maya, \"the Siren\", can \"phaselock\" enemies by trapping them in a sphere of energy for a few seconds. Zer0, \"the [[Assassin]]\", can temporarily become invisible and spawn a hologram [[decoy]] to distract enemies; an attack delivered in this state provides bonus damage. Salvador, \"the Gunzerker\", can use his titular ability to temporarily dual-wield weapons.\n\nNew gameplay elements added to ''Borderlands 2'' include a trading system during multiplayer play; slag, a substance that increases damage to targets that are covered in it; new \"E-Tech\" weaponry; Eridium bars, a new currency for purchasing storage upgrades and other premium items; and the \"Secret Stash,\" a small storage area for [[Twinking|transferring items between characters]]. Increased character customization options are also made available, with collectable items unlocking different character head designs, color schemes, and vehicle paint schemes. A major addition to the game is the \"Badass Rank\" system; points are awarded for completing various in-game challenges, which in turn award tokens that can be redeemed to increase the player's base stats. These stat improvements apply to all of a single player's characters.\n\nSimilarly to the original, completing the main story campaign unlocks \"True Vault Hunter Mode\", a [[New Game Plus]] which increases the difficulty of the game by making enemies stronger, accordingly improves the probability of finding rare and higher-quality items, and allows the player's character to reach level 50. There is also an \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode\" that spawns more difficult enemies and further increases the probability of rare item drops. This mode also raises the level cap to level 61 (72 with an additional DLC pack, The Raid on Digistruct Peak).\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Characters===\nLike its predecessor, ''Borderlands 2'' features four playable characters: Axton the Commando, Maya the Siren, Salvador the Gunzerker, and Zer0 the Assassin. New to ''Borderlands 2'' are two additional characters available as [[downloadable content]]: Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho.\n\nThe four player characters from the first game, Roland, Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai, return in the form of [[non-player character]]s that the new characters will encounter on Pandora, or in various missions.<ref name=\"More information about Borderlands 2 revealed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/45003-more-information-about-borderlands-2-revealed.html|publisher=Tech Spot|author=Matthew DeCarlo|title=More information about Borderlands 2 revealed|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ajnsq5YM?url=http://www.techspot.com/news/45003-more-information-about-borderlands-2-revealed.html|archive-date=September 17, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other characters like the Guardian Angel and Claptrap return to aid the player during quests. Characters from the first game such as Scooter the mechanic, Dr. Zed, Marcus the guns and ammo merchant, Mad Moxxi, and the insane archaeologist Patricia Tannis join new faces such as the cyborg Sir Hammerlock and Scooter's sister Ellie as quest giving characters.\n\n===Setting===\nFive years have passed since the events of ''Borderlands'', when the four Vault Hunters, Roland, Mordecai, Lilith, and Brick were guided by a mysterious entity known as \"The Guardian Angel\" on the planet of Pandora to the Vault, a mysterious alien structure that was rumored to hold ancient and exotic technology and riches. Instead, these Vault Hunters were confronted by an alien abomination known as \"The Destroyer\" inside the Vault. After defeating The Destroyer, a valuable mineral called \"Eridium\" started flourishing through Pandora's crust. [[Handsome Jack]], president of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and makes use of it to attempt to \"bring peace\" to the planet. Now, Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive space station Helios, always visible in the sky in front of Pandora's moon. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.\n\n===Story===\nThe game opens with six Vault Hunters (Axton, Gaige, Krieg, Maya, Salvador, and Zer0) aboard a Hyperion train on Pandora. Jack, supposedly supporting them, suddenly sabotages the train and leaves the Vault Hunters for dead in a frozen wasteland. The Vault Hunters are found by the last remaining CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement made up of former Atlas soldiers and Pandoran citizens, in order to defeat Handsome Jack.\n\nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith, whose powers as a Siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary.\n\nRoland and Lilith learn that that the Vault Key stolen from Tannis is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and ask the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic, explosives-obsessed girl. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg and one of Handsome Jack's enforcers. The Vault Hunters kill Wilhelm and recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from Helios. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away to the sky.\n\nHandsome Jack's plan is to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash the \"Warrior\", a powerful Eridian monster controlled by whoever releases it; knowing that the Vault Key only charges itself once every 200 years, he is using Eridium to forcefully charge it. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a heavily guarded Hyperion facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome the facility's defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Jack; Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a Siren, and Jack's own daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from using her to charge the Vault Key and gaining control of the Warrior. Jack sends in waves of security forces to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland, Lilith and the Vault Hunters successfully kill Angel. An enraged Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he uses to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Before Jack can force Lilith to kill the Vault Hunters, she teleports them out of the facility and back to Sanctuary.\n\nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault to confront Handsome Jack. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtain the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling Hyperion forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters find and defeat Jack himself but are unable to prevent him from opening the Vault. Jack summons the Warrior, and the Vault Hunters manage to kill it and either execute Jack or leave the task to Lilith in the aftermath.\n\nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank within the Key, containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen cuts to black. During the credits, various scenes are shown of the Pandorans celebrating Handsome Jack's defeat and taking back their planet from the remaining Hyperion forces, Lilith becoming the new leader of the Crimson Raiders, the Vault Hunters being hailed as heroes for their deeds, Lilith, Brick and Mordecai mourning Roland, and Mordecai hatching and raising a new pet bird called Talon.\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the unexpected<ref name=\"Take Two 'grossly underestimated' by gamers, retailers-Analyst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6216340.html?tag=result;title;2|publisher=Gamespot|author=Brendan Sinclair|title=Take Two 'grossly underestimated' by gamers, retailers-Analyst|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> success of the first ''Borderlands'', which sold between three<ref name=\"Borderlands sells 3 million units; Pitchford discusses Gearbox hiring policy, Gamertag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/19/borderlands-sells-3-milion-units-pitchford-discusses-gearbox/|publisher=Joystiq|author=Alexander Sliwinski|title=Borderlands sells 3 million units; Pitchford discusses Gearbox hiring policy, Gamertag|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828174748/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/19/borderlands-sells-3-milion-units-pitchford-discusses-gearbox|archive-date=August 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to four-and-a-half million copies since release,<ref name=\"Take-Two sales sink 12% in June quarter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6327818/take-two-sales-sink-12-in-june-quarter|publisher=Gamespot|work=[[CBS Interactive|CBS Interactive Inc.]]|author=Tom Magrino and Eddie Makuch|title=Take-Two sales sink 12% in June quarter|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920141214/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6327818/take-two-sales-sink-12-in-june-quarter|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> creative director [[Mikey Neumann|Mike Neumann]] stated that there was a chance of a ''Borderlands 2'' being created, adding that the decision \"seems like a no-brainer.\"<ref name=\"Interview: Gearbox on Borderlands 2, Pitchford's Valve remarks and tons more\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2009/11/11/interview-gearbox-on-borderlands-2-pitchfords-valve-remarks-and-tons-more/|publisher=VG 24/7|author=Patrick Garratt|title=Interview: Gearbox on Borderlands 2, Pitchford's Valve remarks and tons more|date=November 9, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810192749/http://www.vg247.com/2009/11/11/interview-gearbox-on-borderlands-2-pitchfords-valve-remarks-and-tons-more/|archive-date=August 10, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 2, 2011, the game was confirmed and titled as ''Borderlands 2'', with [[Anthony Burch]] announced as the writer the next day.

IGN gave the port a 5.4 out of 10, concluding that \"its compromised visuals rob it of much of its bombastic charm, while its erratic performance and unreliable touch controls keep the gameplay from shining like it has in the past.\"<ref name=\"ign-b2vitareview\">{{cite web|title=Borderlands 2 Vita Review|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/05/12/borderlands-2-vita-review|work=IGN|accessdate=May 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027115749/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/05/12/borderlands-2-vita-review|archive-date=October 27, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"escapist-b2vitareview\">{{cite web|title=Borderlands 2 PS Vita Review - Handsome Slack|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/11436-Borderlands-2-PS-Vita-Review-Handsome-Slack|work=The Escapist|accessdate=May 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513050619/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/11436-Borderlands-2-PS-Vita-Review-Handsome-Slack|archive-date=May 13, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Four playable character classes are available in the base game, each with their own unique abilities and [[skill tree]]s: Axton, \"the Commando\", can summon a [[turret]] to provide offensive support. Maya, \"the Siren\", can \"phaselock\" enemies by trapping them in a sphere of energy for a few seconds. Zer0, \"the [[Assassin]]\", can temporarily become invisible and spawn a hologram [[decoy]] to distract enemies; an attack delivered in this state provides bonus damage. Salvador, \"the Gunzerker\", can use his titular ability to temporarily dual-wield weapons.\n\nNew gameplay elements added to ''Borderlands 2'' include a trading system during multiplayer play; slag, a substance that increases damage to targets that are covered in it; new \"E-Tech\" weaponry; Eridium bars, a new currency for purchasing storage upgrades and other premium items; and the \"Secret Stash,\" a small storage area for [[Twinking|transferring items between characters]]. Increased character customization options are also made available, with collectable items unlocking different character head designs, color schemes, and vehicle paint schemes. A major addition to the game is the \"Badass Rank\" system; points are awarded for completing various in-game challenges, which in turn award tokens that can be redeemed to increase the player's base stats. These stat improvements apply to all of a single player's characters.\n\nSimilarly to the original, completing the main story campaign unlocks \"True Vault Hunter Mode\", a [[New Game Plus]] which increases the difficulty of the game by making enemies stronger, accordingly improves the probability of finding rare and higher-quality items, and allows the player's character to reach level 50. There is also an \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode\" that spawns more difficult enemies and further increases the probability of rare item drops.

Characters from the first game such as Scooter the mechanic, Dr. Zed, Marcus the guns and ammo merchant, Mad Moxxi, and the insane archaeologist Patricia Tannis join new faces such as the cyborg Sir Hammerlock and Scooter's sister Ellie as quest giving characters.\n\n===Setting===\nFive years have passed since the events of ''Borderlands'', when the four Vault Hunters, Roland, Mordecai, Lilith, and Brick were guided by a mysterious entity known as \"The Guardian Angel\" on the planet of Pandora to the Vault, a mysterious alien structure that was rumored to hold ancient and exotic technology and riches. Instead, these Vault Hunters were confronted by an alien abomination known as \"The Destroyer\" inside the Vault. After defeating The Destroyer, a valuable mineral called \"Eridium\" started flourishing through Pandora's crust. [[Handsome Jack]], president of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and makes use of it to attempt to \"bring peace\" to the planet. Now, Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive space station Helios, always visible in the sky in front of Pandora's moon. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.\n\n===Story===\nThe game opens with six Vault Hunters (Axton, Gaige, Krieg, Maya, Salvador, and Zer0) aboard a Hyperion train on Pandora. Jack, supposedly supporting them, suddenly sabotages the train and leaves the Vault Hunters for dead in a frozen wasteland. The Vault Hunters are found by the last remaining CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement made up of former Atlas soldiers and Pandoran citizens, in order to defeat Handsome Jack.\n\nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith, whose powers as a Siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary.\n\nRoland and Lilith learn that that the Vault Key stolen from Tannis is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and ask the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic, explosives-obsessed girl. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg and one of Handsome Jack's enforcers. The Vault Hunters kill Wilhelm and recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from Helios. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away to the sky.\n\nHandsome Jack's plan is to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash the \"Warrior\", a powerful Eridian monster controlled by whoever releases it; knowing that the Vault Key only charges itself once every 200 years, he is using Eridium to forcefully charge it. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a heavily guarded Hyperion facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome the facility's defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Jack; Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a Siren, and Jack's own daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from using her to charge the Vault Key and gaining control of the Warrior. Jack sends in waves of security forces to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland, Lilith and the Vault Hunters successfully kill Angel. An enraged Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he uses to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Before Jack can force Lilith to kill the Vault Hunters, she teleports them out of the facility and back to Sanctuary.\n\nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault to confront Handsome Jack. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtain the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling Hyperion forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters find and defeat Jack himself but are unable to prevent him from opening the Vault. Jack summons the Warrior, and the Vault Hunters manage to kill it and either execute Jack or leave the task to Lilith in the aftermath.\n\nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank within the Key, containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen cuts to black. During the credits, various scenes are shown of the Pandorans celebrating Handsome Jack's defeat and taking back their planet from the remaining Hyperion forces, Lilith becoming the new leader of the Crimson Raiders, the Vault Hunters being hailed as heroes for their deeds, Lilith, Brick and Mordecai mourning Roland, and Mordecai hatching and raising a new pet bird called Talon.\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the unexpected<ref name=\"Take Two 'grossly underestimated' by gamers, retailers-Analyst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6216340.html?tag=result;title;2|publisher=Gamespot|author=Brendan Sinclair|title=Take Two 'grossly underestimated' by gamers, retailers-Analyst|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> success of the first ''Borderlands'', which sold between three<ref name=\"Borderlands sells 3 million units; Pitchford discusses Gearbox hiring policy, Gamertag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/19/borderlands-sells-3-milion-units-pitchford-discusses-gearbox/|publisher=Joystiq|author=Alexander Sliwinski|title=Borderlands sells 3 million units; Pitchford discusses Gearbox hiring policy, Gamertag|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828174748/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/19/borderlands-sells-3-milion-units-pitchford-discusses-gearbox|archive-date=August 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to four-and-a-half million copies since release,<ref name=\"Take-Two sales sink 12% in June quarter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6327818/take-two-sales-sink-12-in-june-quarter|publisher=Gamespot|work=[[CBS Interactive|CBS Interactive Inc.]]|author=Tom Magrino and Eddie Makuch|title=Take-Two sales sink 12% in June quarter|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920141214/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6327818/take-two-sales-sink-12-in-june-quarter|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> creative director [[Mikey Neumann|Mike Neumann]] stated that there was a chance of a ''Borderlands 2'' being created, adding that the decision \"seems like a no-brainer.\"<ref name=\"Interview: Gearbox on Borderlands 2, Pitchford's Valve remarks and tons more\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2009/11/11/interview-gearbox-on-borderlands-2-pitchfords-valve-remarks-and-tons-more/|publisher=VG 24/7|author=Patrick Garratt|title=Interview: Gearbox on Borderlands 2, Pitchford's Valve remarks and tons more|date=November 9, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810192749/http://www.vg247.com/2009/11/11/interview-gearbox-on-borderlands-2-pitchfords-valve-remarks-and-tons-more/|archive-date=August 10, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 2, 2011, the game was confirmed and titled as ''Borderlands 2'', with [[Anthony Burch]] announced as the writer the next day.

The film was a financial success and received generally good reviews (it also led to a further two sequels, neither of which Franklin was involved with). Franklin then directed the 1984 spy/adventure movie ''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', starring [[Henry Thomas]] and [[Dabney Coleman]]. The film was a remake of ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'' (1949), which was in turn based on the short story \"The Boy Who Cried Murder\" by [[Cornell Woolrich]] (Woolrich's short story \"It Had to Be Murder\" was adapted into Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'', which was the inspiration for Franklin's ''Road Games''). \n\nFranklin was going to make ''The Lost Boys'' at one stage<ref>http://www.avclub.com/article/tom-holland-his-seminal-vampire-flick-fright-night-223200</ref> but his next film was ''[[Link (film)|Link]]'' (1986) a British horror movie (starring [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Terence Stamp]]) about a super-intelligent, murderous [[orangutan]].

''Gruppe'' and II. ''Gruppe'' formed without a ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]''. The II. ''Gruppe'' was initially equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and was known as ''Jagdgruppe'' 176, while it retained its heavy fighter identity officially, then re-equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] over the winter, 1939/40. The organisation and equipment of the ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' units was typical at this time. [[ZG 26]] was operated and organised in a similar fashion.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|pp=170, 176-177, 205}}\n\nThe ''Geschwaderstab'' was created on 15 April 1940 in [[K\u00f6ln]]-Wahn. The III. ''Gruppe'' was raised on 26 June 1940 in [[Trier]]-Euren with the Messerschmitt Bf 110.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Invasion of Poland and Phoney War===\nOn 1 September 1939 the [[Invasion of Poland|German Wehrmacht invaded Poland]] beginning World War II in Europe. ZG 76 operated with one ''gruppe'' during the campaign. I./ZG 76 was based at [[Gablingen]] under the command of ''Fligerdivision'' 6. Approximately 100 Bf 110s were combat ready for action in Poland indicating a shortfall in production. A ratio of one ''rotte'' [flight] per ''kampfstaffel'' [bomber squadron] had to suffice.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}}\n\n[[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], commanding [[Luftflotte 4]], regarded the destruction of the [[Polish Air Force]] of such importance he ordered [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]]'s air command to attack airfields near [[Krakow]]. I./ZG 26 was ordered to provide [[fighter escort]] for bombers from I and III/[[KG 4]] and I and III/[[KG 77]]. The attacks on these airfields involved 150 [[sortie]]s. KG 4 dropped 200 tons of bombs on 1 September. The group claimed 19 Polish fighters destroyed. Future German fighter pilots Wolfgang Falcke, [[Helmut Lent]] and [[Gordon Gollob]] making claims in aerial combat.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}} I./ZG 76 provided effective protection to [[KG 27]] on its long-range bombing missions.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n\nOther heavy fighter units claimed victories as well; I(Z)/[[LG 1]] claimed wildly optimistic total of 34 Polish fighters shot down, while [[ZG 2]] claimed 78 in the air and 50 on the ground.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}} The true losses of Colonel Stefan Pawlikowski's Pursuit Brigade were 10 fighters destroyed and 24 \"unserviceable\" [presumably meaning damaged]; 62 percent of its strength. Total German losses across Poland was 25 aircraft.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=180}}  The percentage increased to 72 percent by the 5 September.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-011, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A ZG 76 Bf 110C with \"sharks mouth\" nose paint]]\nOn 2 September I./ZG 76, led by Lent, claimed 11 aircraft at [[D\u0119blin]] ,while KG 4 dropped 180 tonnes of bombs in 13 ''staffeln''-sized operations. The aircraft destroyed were not frontline aircraft, but were from training units. Later in the day the ''gruppe'' was credited with nine [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army]] fighters, attached to protect the Polish army on the approaches to [[Warsaw]]. Only three were actually lost. The survivors, however, lost five to [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s to JGr 102. The Pursuit Brigade was transferred to an unspecified sector giving Luftwaffe bombers a free-hand.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=180}} The cost of the air battle to ZG 76 was three Bf 110s.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n\nOn 3 September the ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' escorted bombers attacking the [[PZL P.11]] factory in Warsaw. They claimed three of the 40 defending fighters losing one. From 4 September Polish aerial resistance had been reduced, and consequently were ordered to conduct a larger number of [[close air support]] operations.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|pp=180-181}} I./ZG 76 was temporarily transferred to [[Ulrich Grauert]]'s I Fliegerdivision and fought in the [[Battle of I\u0142\u017ca]] from 9 September.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=185}}\n\nAfter the Polish capitulation following the [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, ZG 76 reorganised in the [[Phoney War]] period. II and III/ZG 76 finally were able to convert from the Bf 109 to Bf 110 and shed their ''Jadggruppe'' designations.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=205}} ZG 76 flew protection patrols ([[Defence of the Reich]]) over the German [[North Sea]] coast in late 1939. Elements of it took part in the [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] on 18 December 1939 and the wing claimed five [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers shot down.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=39}} RAF losses were 12 bombers destroyed, three damaged and 57 men  killed, though German claims were far higher.{{sfn|Holmes|2010|p=69}}\n\n===Norwegian campaign===\nOn 9 April 1940, German forces began [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], an invasion of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|X Fliegerkorps]] was allocated to the operation, which was conducted in cooperation with the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] and the [[Kriegsmarine]]. The air corps was commanded by ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Hans Ferdinand Geisler]]. Only I./ZG 76 from the wing participated based at airstrips near [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]]. 3./[[ZG 1]] was attached to it.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=288}} The immediate objective was to secure airfields in northern Denmark to secure the air space and communications links to the Norwegian capital [[Oslo]] from [[Royal Navy]] intervention.{{sfn|Claasen|2001|p=54}} The [[German invasion of Denmark]] was carried out in the space of 24 hours. 1./ZG 76 assisted in the seizure of [[Aalborg]] airport on the northern Danish coast granting air superiority over the [[Skagerrak]]. Signallers, ground crews, clerks and essential equipment was forwn in by [[Junkers Ju 52]]s from KGzbV 1. II./KGzbV 1 flew to [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]] to land soldiers and [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] battalions. Lent and 1./ZG 76 gave air cover. The ''staffel'' claimed one [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] in combat and two on the ground in exchange for one Ju 52. Commander Hansen and Helmut Lent maintained over claiming an [[RAF Coastal Command]] [[Short Sunderland]] probing Oslo fjord.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|pp=31-33}}\n\n[[File:Norwegian Gloster Gladiator - Kristian Fredrik Schye.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian Gladiator 427 downed by Lent on 9 April 1940{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|p=61}}]]\n\nThe ''Haerens Flygev\u00e5pen'' possessed only 24 combat aircraft (13 serviceable) and five [[Tiger Moth]] trainers. Most flew north to continue the fight against the invaders. Six aircraft, including four [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]]s, were destroyed by ZG 76.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=33}} The landing at [[Stavanger]] was successful, but 3./KG 4 and 3./ZG 76 failed to prevent eight [[Caproni Ca.135]] bombers escaping north.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=33}} From [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], on 12 April, Hauptmann G\u00fcnther Reinecke's I./ZG 76 claimed five Wellingtons on this date but the Luftwaffe could not stop the destruction of 12 aircraft and the damage to 31 others at [[Bergen]] and Stavanger-Sola to 2 May.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=36}} ZG 76 carried out strafing missions countering the [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings]] and [[Namsos campaign]].{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=37}} [[KG 26]] and [[KG 1]] destroyed the ammunition dumps and razed the wharves. [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] flew in Gladiator squadrons to [[Lesjaskogsvatnet]] on 24 April. In repsonse, LG 1, escorted by Bf 110s from ZG 76 and sometimes Z./[[KG 30]], destroyed the airfield in eight hours, eliminating 19 fighters. The survivors flew to the airstrip at [[Setnesmoen]], which was destroyed in further attacks while the last five Norwegian combat aircraft and five Moths flew north.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=38}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-399-0006-19, Norwegen, besch\u00e4digte Bf 110.jpg|thumb|right|Lent's Bf&nbsp;110C ran out of fuel during the [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Battle of Fornebu]] and was forced to land.{{sfn|Weal|1999|p=26}} A troop-carrying Ju&nbsp;52 flies over Lent's Bf&nbsp;110.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|p=62}}]]\n\nFurther south, I./ZG 76 was less successful. On 12 April it accounted for two [[No. 149 Squadron RAF|149 Squadron]] Wellingtons and [[Squadron Leader]] Nolan, [[No. 38 Squadron RAF|38 Squadron]]. All crews were killed.{{sfn|Bowyer|2015|p=65}} Nolan was probably shot down by the future night fighter ace [[Helmut Woltersdorf]].{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=259}} On 30 April [[RAF Bomber Command]] struck at Stavanger. ZG 76 lost their commanding officer, Hauptmann G\u00fcnther Reinecke killed in action with British bombers, along with other flying aces ''[[Leutnant]]'' Helmut Fahlbusch and ''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'' Georg Fleischmann. Reinecke was replaced by Hauptmann Werner Restermeyer.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=39}} The ''gruppe'' claimed four bombers between 20:40 and 21:00 in the last minutes of daylight preventing the action from being classified as [[night fighter]] interceptions.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=15}} \n\nZG 76 fought in the [[Battles of Narvik]] to counter the threat from RAF fighter units operating from [[Bardufoss Airport]]. The aerial battles were complicated for ZG 76 by the introduction of the Bf 110D-0 \"[[daschund]]\" belly which provided the aircraft with a 30-minute increase in endurance but at the cost of futher reductions in manoevrability in an already unmanoevrable aircraft in combat nimble single-seat fighters.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=41}}{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=338}} The wing supported I./[[StG 1]] and its bombing offensive against [[Bod\u00f8]], which damaged much of the town.{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=332}} Among the final known air combats over Norway during the campaign involved Lent. [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Caesar Hull]] was shot down by Lent on 27 May and on the 2 June [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]], aircraft serial number N5893 piloted by [[Pilot Officer]] J.L. Wilkie were downed.{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=338}} I/ZG 76 remained in Norway with JG 77 for air defence after the campaign. On 9 July 1940 they two units shot down seven from 12 Blenheim bombers (from [[No. 21 Squadron RAF|12 Squadron]]) sent to bomb Stavanger.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=28}}\n\nThe Luftwaffe considered a glider-borne assualt on the Allied-held airfield at Bardufoss but it had only nine gliders available. Further operations were precluded by the Allied withdrawal in view of the worsening situation in [[France]]. The cost of the campaign to the Luftwaffe was 260 aircraft, including 86 transports. 1,130 aircrew became casualties, including 341 killed, and 448 missing. They destroyed 93 of the 169 British aircraft lost including 43 in air combat, 24 by Luftwaffe-controlled anti-aircraft units. The most successful unit was ZG 76 which was credited with 16 enemy aircraft followed by JG 77 with 13.{{sfn|Hooton|2007b|p=43}}\n\n===Western Europe===\nStab and II/ZG 76 was assigned to the [[1st Air Corps (Germany)|Fliegerkorps I]] under the command of [[Generaloberst]] [[Ulrich Grauert]] near [[Cologne]]-Wahn. On 10 May 1940 the German offensive opened with [[Fall Gelb]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands]] and [[Battle of Belgium]] as a prelude to the larger [[Battle of France]]. During the first day of operations the heavy fighter wings flew 2,000 sorties with the Bf 109-equipped units.{{sfn|Hooton|2007|pp=46-47}} ZG 76 supported the southern flank of [[Army Group B]] and the northern flank of [[Army Group A]] during the [[Panzer Division]]s dash to the [[English Channel]] following the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|breakthrough at Sedan]] from 14 May. On 15 May it is known to have fought in combat with [[No. 87 Squadron RAF]] over [[Montcornet, Aisne|Montcornet]]\u2014the site of [[Battle of Montcornet|a major battle]] two days later\u2014II./ZG 76 reporting two losses. A 87 Squadron pilot was reported killed in this encounter.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|pp=147-148, 155}} Later in the day, a known success was reported in combat with [[No. 3 Squadron RAF]] which attempted to engage Dornier Do 17s of 8./KG 76. Two pilots are believed to have been lost to II./ZG 76.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|pp=151-152}} One as killed the other captured.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|p=155}} On 18 May, II./ZG 76 flew as escorts to III./KG 76 as the group made repeated bombing raids. Over Vitry airfield, a large [[dogfight]] broke out when all available [[Hawker Hurricane]] units were scrambled to intercept. [[No. 79 Squadron RAF|79]], [[No. 607 Squadron RAF|607]], [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615]] and [[No. 151 Squadron RAF|151 Squadron]] were involved. Over [[Merville, Nord]] and [[Lille]] one 4 and one 6./ZG 76 crew were killed. [[Geschwaderkommodore]] [[Walter Grabmann]], who flew with Stab./ZG 76 that evening was shot down and became a [[prisoner of war]]. His gunner, [[Feldwebel]] Richard Krone was [[killed in action]].{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|pp=221-224}} According to records, one Hurricane from B Flight, [[No. 111 Squadron RAF]], that arrived on the scene was shot down by a ZG 76 Bf 110. a [[No. 56 Squadron RAF]] Hurricane pilot from B Flight, [[Flight Lieutenant]] S Soden was killed in action with II./ZG 76.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|pp=234-235}} \n[[File:Walter Grabmann.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Grabmann, the first Geschwaderkommodore was shot down and captured on 18 May 1940]]\nOn 21 May, ZG 76 was in combat supporting German forces in the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]]. In combat with 229 and 253 Squadrons intercepting bombers from III./[[KG 1]], the ZG 76 Bf 110s managed to down two Hurricanes; one pilot was killed while Squadron Leader Elliot was captured. One of the 9./KG 1 bombers was shot down.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|pp=300-301}} On 23 May, according to Fighter Command records, four fighters were lost in action with Bf 110 units killing one pilot, wounding another while two were wounded.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=31}}\n\nII./ZG 76 fought over the [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk beaches]] during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. On 26 May the ''gruppe'' made a single claim against an unknown aircraft type and squadron.{{sfn|Franks|2006|p=187}} According to [[RAF Fighter Command]] records, two Hurricane pilots were shot down by Bf 110s this day\u2014the pilot from [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|17 Squadron]] was killed and the other from [[No. 605 Squadron RAF|605 Squadron]] returned to his unit.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=33}} Neither [[ZG 1]], ZG 2 or [[ZG 26]] filed any claims on 26 May.{{sfn|Franks|2006|p=187}} Dunkirk was a severe test for Fighter Command which had been designed as a defensive force. Fighter leaders were often forced to operate outside of British-based radar range, and thus RAF controllers in England were unable to assist in coordinating the squadrons. The Germans could dictate the terms of the battle; the when, where and height of the engagement, often in superior numbers.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=30}} On 27 May four fighters were reported lost in combat with Bf 110s [two credited to Bf 110s and [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers] by Fighter Command.{{sfn|Franks|1997|pp=31\u201334}}\n\nThe command staffel and II/ZG 76 continued operations with Fliegerkorps I for the duration of [[Fall Rot]]. Fliegerkorps I operated in the [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]] sectors in a bid to stop further evacuations. The air corps failed, and [[Operation Ariel]] succeeded.\n\nHans-Joachim Jabs surmised his experience with ZG 76 over Europe in the Bf 110 as follows;  \" I flew a 110 from 10 May 1940 over France, Belgium and during the Battle of Britain. In the Me 110 we were superior to the French and Belgians, whether Morane or Curtis. But we were inferior to the Spitfire, and Hurricane as well.\"{{sfn|Eriksson|2017|p=23}} By the end of May 1940 Jabs had claimed six aircraft.{{sfn|Weal|1999|p=102}}\n\n===Battle of Britain===\nIn August 1940 the Stabschwarme, II and III ''Gruppe'' based at [[Arrondissement of Laval|Laval]]. Hitler decided that air superiority of England was required if any invasion, codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]] proceeded. The Luftwaffe began probing attacks by day and night over England. [[Luftflotte 2]] and [[Luftflotte 3]] began bombing attacks on British convoys in the [[English Channel]] in the hopes of blocking the sea lanes to shipping and drawing out [[RAF Fighter Command]] and depleting its strength and a prelude to attacking airfields and aircraft factories. The Luftwaffe referred to this period as the [[Kanalkampf]]. \n\nOn 10 July the [[Battle of Britain]] opened with attacks on Channel convoy ''Bread''. [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]] ordered ''Fliegerkorps VIII'' to prepared for further operations at first light. [[Hugo Sperrle]], commanding ''Luftflotte'' 3, ordered more ''Stuka'' attack. ZG 76 from Fliegerkorps I was tasked with performing fighter escort duties for Ju 87s of III/[[StG 2]].{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=159\u2013160}} [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87]], [[No. 238 Squadron RAF|238]] and [[No. 601 Squadron RAF|601]] intercepted and ZG 76 lost four crews protecting the ''Stukas'' over the [[Isle of Portland]].

''Gruppe'' and II. ''Gruppe'' formed without a ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]''. The II. ''Gruppe'' was initially equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and was known as ''Jagdgruppe'' 176, while it retained its heavy fighter identity officially, then re-equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] over the winter, 1939/40. The organisation and equipment of the ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' units was typical at this time. [[ZG 26]] was operated and organised in a similar fashion.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|pp=170, 176-177, 205}}\n\nThe ''Geschwaderstab'' was created on 15 April 1940 in [[K\u00f6ln]]-Wahn. The III. ''Gruppe'' was raised on 26 June 1940 in [[Trier]]-Euren with the Messerschmitt Bf 110.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Invasion of Poland and Phoney War===\nOn 1 September 1939 the [[Invasion of Poland|German Wehrmacht invaded Poland]] beginning World War II in Europe. ZG 76 operated with one ''gruppe'' during the campaign. I./ZG 76 was based at [[Gablingen]] under the command of ''Fligerdivision'' 6. Approximately 100 Bf 110s were combat ready for action in Poland indicating a shortfall in production. A ratio of one ''rotte'' [flight] per ''kampfstaffel'' [bomber squadron] had to suffice.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}}\n\n[[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], commanding [[Luftflotte 4]], regarded the destruction of the [[Polish Air Force]] of such importance he ordered [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]]'s air command to attack airfields near [[Krakow]]. I./ZG 26 was ordered to provide [[fighter escort]] for bombers from I and III/[[KG 4]] and I and III/[[KG 77]]. The attacks on these airfields involved 150 [[sortie]]s. KG 4 dropped 200 tons of bombs on 1 September. The group claimed 19 Polish fighters destroyed. Future German fighter pilots Wolfgang Falcke, [[Helmut Lent]] and [[Gordon Gollob]] making claims in aerial combat.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}} I./ZG 76 provided effective protection to [[KG 27]] on its long-range bombing missions.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n\nOther heavy fighter units claimed victories as well; I(Z)/[[LG 1]] claimed wildly optimistic total of 34 Polish fighters shot down, while [[ZG 2]] claimed 78 in the air and 50 on the ground.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=179}} The true losses of Colonel Stefan Pawlikowski's Pursuit Brigade were 10 fighters destroyed and 24 \"unserviceable\" [presumably meaning damaged]; 62 percent of its strength. Total German losses across Poland was 25 aircraft.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=180}}  The percentage increased to 72 percent by the 5 September.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-011, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A ZG 76 Bf 110C with \"sharks mouth\" nose paint]]\nOn 2 September I./ZG 76, led by Lent, claimed 11 aircraft at [[D\u0119blin]] ,while KG 4 dropped 180 tonnes of bombs in 13 ''staffeln''-sized operations. The aircraft destroyed were not frontline aircraft, but were from training units. Later in the day the ''gruppe'' was credited with nine [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army]] fighters, attached to protect the Polish army on the approaches to [[Warsaw]]. Only three were actually lost. The survivors, however, lost five to [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s to JGr 102. The Pursuit Brigade was transferred to an unspecified sector giving Luftwaffe bombers a free-hand.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=180}} The cost of the air battle to ZG 76 was three Bf 110s.{{sfn|Hooton|2007a|p=86}}\n\nOn 3 September the ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' escorted bombers attacking the [[PZL P.11]] factory in Warsaw. They claimed three of the 40 defending fighters losing one. From 4 September Polish aerial resistance had been reduced, and consequently were ordered to conduct a larger number of [[close air support]] operations.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|pp=180-181}} I./ZG 76 was temporarily transferred to [[Ulrich Grauert]]'s I Fliegerdivision and fought in the [[Battle of I\u0142\u017ca]] from 9 September.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=185}}\n\nAfter the Polish capitulation following the [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, ZG 76 reorganised in the [[Phoney War]] period. II and III/ZG 76 finally were able to convert from the Bf 109 to Bf 110 and shed their ''Jadggruppe'' designations.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|p=205}} ZG 76 flew protection patrols ([[Defence of the Reich]]) over the German [[North Sea]] coast in late 1939. Elements of it took part in the [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] on 18 December 1939 and the wing claimed five [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers shot down.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=39}} RAF losses were 12 bombers destroyed, three damaged and 57 men  killed, though German claims were far higher.{{sfn|Holmes|2010|p=69}}\n\n===Norwegian campaign===\nOn 9 April 1940, German forces began [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], an invasion of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|X Fliegerkorps]] was allocated to the operation, which was conducted in cooperation with the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] and the [[Kriegsmarine]]. The air corps was commanded by ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Hans Ferdinand Geisler]].

III/ZG 76 moved to [[Bergen]], Norway while Stab/ZG 76 remained in Stavanger.{{sfn|Foreman|1993|pp=24, 27}} III/ZG 76 was exiled to Norway in October 1940 under the command of Rolf Kaldrack and disbanded in 24 April 1941 to become II/[[SKG 210]].{{sfn|Goss|2018}} It began reformation in 1943 but this was never completed and personnel were sent to the reformed I/ZG 76 in 1944.\n\nZG 76 was not recorded on [[Luftflotte 4]]'s order of battle for the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] or the [[Battle of Greece]] on 5 April 1941.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1992|pp=180\u2013181, 329}} II/ZG 76 moved to Argos where one of its aircraft was damaged in a surprise attack by [[No. 252 Squadron RAF]] on 14 May, during the build-up to the [[Battle of Crete]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1992|p=329}} II/ZG 76 was allocated to Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1992|p=338}} On 22 May, two days into the battle, ZG 76 reported its first two losses in action over [[Suda Bay]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1992|p=359}} A further crew was lost when the group attacked [[Motor Launch]] ML1011. The vessel was holed and one crewman killed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1992|p=368}} During the Crete operation a single ''staffel'', 4/ZG 76, flew to [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]], to fight the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], but the venture was a failure. Among the crews that travelled was [[Martin Drewes]] who became a successful night fighter pilot.{{sfn|Weal|1999|p=65}}{{sfn|Mackay|2000|p=125}} The aircraft wore [[Iraqi Air Force]] insignia.{{sfn|Mackay|2000|p=73}} The campaign in Crete ended in a [[pyrrhic victory]] for the Germans because of the paratrooper and aircraft losses.{{sfn|Mackay|2000|p=71}}\n\n===Defence of the Reich===\n\nIn mid-1943 the Zerst\u00f6rer wings experienced a brief revival. The [[Defence of the Reich]] (''Reischsverteidigung''\u2014RLV) was now a priority theatre, despite the defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. The [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] in [[Berlin]] decided their was merit in reforming the Bf 110 units for the firepower of the type was suitable for destroying [[heavy bombers]] over Germany.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=105}} The OKL foresaw their use while the Luftwaffe still retained a measure of control over German skies and in southern European theatres in the naval escort and [[close air support]] role. Scattered Zerst\u00f6rer units were recalled from [[Eastern Europe]] and Mediterranean for be reformed into wings. ZG 76 was ordered to reform in southern Germany from training and reconnaissance units. The wing was permitted two ''gruppen'' of Bf 110Gs.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=105}} The wing was partially equipped with [[Messerschmitt Me 410]]s and aircrew drawn from I/[[NJG 101]]. The reformed unit was assigned to the [[5th Fighter Division (Germany)|5th Jagddivision]].{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=170}} ZG 76 was still in southern Germany through the winter, 1943/44. 6./ZG 76 were photographed in formation over the [[German Alps]] with drop tanks, a double 20mm cannon pod under the fuselage and armed with [[Werfer-Granate 21]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=157}} All ''gruppen'' of ZG 76 had the Werfer-Granate 21 installed to break up American bomber formations.{{sfn|Forsyth|2019|p=89}}\n\n[[Theodor Rossiwall]] was given command of ZG 76. Initially formed with Bf 110s but converted to the Me 410 in full by April 1944. I/ZG 76 reformed at [[Ansbach]], II/ZG 76 at [[Wertheim]] under Major Herbert Kaminski. Huaptmann Johannes Keil was to command III/ZG 76 from [[Oettingen in Bayern]], but a shortage of aircraft forced the abandonment of this and the remnants were subsumed into I/ZG 76.{{sfn|Forsyth|2019|p=79}} Though faster than the Bf 110, the Me 410 was not liked by its crews. It was more difficult to bail out of, and was not as agile as the Bf 110. Some crews felt the Bf 110 could sustain much more combat damage than the Me 410.{{sfn|Forsyth|2019|p=79}}\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 410A-1 U2 Hornisse (32899934576).jpg|thumb|right|Me 410, operated by ZG 76 from April 1944]]\nOn 4 October 1943 the US [[Eighth Air Force]] attacked targets in [[Frankfurt]]. Some 130 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers were dispatched by the [[1st Bombardment Division]] while 168 from the [[3rd Bomb Division]] operated against targets in the [[Saarland]] and the [[Saint-Dizier \u2013 Robinson Air Base|Saint-Dizier airbase]], which had been made operational and housed II/[[JG 27]]. 14 B-17s were ultimately lost. II/ZG 76 engaged the [[bomber stream]] alone and claimed four. They then ran into the US [[56th Fighter Group]], without any escorting [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s or Bf 109s near [[D\u00fcren]]. The resulting dogfight was characterised by Caldwell and [[Richard R. Muller]] as a \"slaughter.\"{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=124}} Nine Bf 110s and 11 men were killed with seven wounded. The dead included both group commanders.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=124}} The introduction of long-range American fighter escorts in February 1944, signalled an increase in losses for the Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader. On 16 March 1944, 26 of 43 Bf 110s sent by ZG 76 into battle were shot down; a devastating loss rate.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=270}}\n\nBy August 1944, the [[Normandy Campaign|German front in Normandy]] was on the verge of [[Falaise Pocket|collapse at Falaise]]. The battles in Normandy had left the German fighter forces spread thinly; the resulting attrition having taken a toll of fighter units. II/ZG 76 was reforming and recuperating alone at [[Prague]]. Stab and I/ZG 76 were still operational but had to be used with extreme caution. They were based in [[Vienna]] under the command of the [[8th Fighter Division (Germany)|8th Jagddivision]] with II/ZG 1. Only I/[[JG 302]] was assigned to the division with single-engine fighters. II/ZG 26 remained isolated in [[East Prussia]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=209}} In the south ZG 76 formed the defences against the US [[Fifteenth Air Force]]. On 16 June 1944 the Americans attacked Vienna and [[Bratislava]]. I/[[JG 300]], I/JG 302, II/ZG 1 and I/ZG 76 flew interceptions. 20 [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers were claimed along with one [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] and two [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s. American losses totalled nine B-24s, two B-17s, seven P-38s and one P-51s. The majority of the P-38s fell to Hungarian-flown Bf 109s. US fighter pilot claimed 40; at least 16 Axis fighters were shot down.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=210}} On 20 June, the Eighth Air Force sent 1,378 bombers to targets in [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] and [[Hannover]]. The only interception attempted by ZG 76 was against the [[492nd Bombardment Group]] as the Germans flew north from Prague. They were hit by P-51s before they reached the bombers and lost three Me 410s and their crews.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=211}} An attack by 667 bombers of the US Fifteenth against Vienna unfolded on the 26 June 1944. I/ZG 76 claimed three B-24s but lost eight Bf 110s.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=212}} On 27 June the Fifteenth attacked [[Budapest]]. Over [[Lake Balaton]], II/ZG 1 and I/ZG 76 took advantaged of cloud cover to shoot down four B-24s from the [[460th Bombardment Group]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=213}} On 2 July the Americans struck at the city again. I/ZG 76 committed 20 Me 410s. I/ZG 76 reported to have found a gap in the escort and claimed 13 bombers for one Me 410. Only four bombers failed to return, however.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|pp=213-214}}\n\n===Disbandment===\n\n==Commanding officers==\n* Generalmajor [[Walter Grabmann]], 15 April 1940 \u2013 31 July 1941\n* Oberstleutnant [[Theodor Rossiwall]], August 1943 \u2013 24 January 1944\n* Oberstleutnant Robert Kowalewski, 25 January \u2013 24 July 1944\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Ansel\n  |first=Walter\n  |year=1972\n  |title=Hitler and the Middle Sea\n  |location=\n  |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]\n  |isbn=978-0-8223-0224-7\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Aders\n  |first=Gebhard\n  |year=1978\n  |title=History of the German Night Fighter Force, 1917\u20131945\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Janes \n  |isbn=0-354-01247-9\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Bergstr\u00f6m\n  |first1=Christer\n  |last2=Mikhailov\n  |first2=Andrey\n  |authorlink=\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Black Cross / Red Star: Air War Over the Eastern Front, Volume II, Resurgence January\u2013June 1942\n  |location=\n  |publisher=Pacifica Military History\n  |isbn=978-0-935553-51-2\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bergstr\u00f6m\n  |first=Christer\n  |authorlink=\n  |year=2007a\n  |title=Barbarossa - The Air Battle: July\u2013December 1941\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Chevron/Ian Allan\n  |isbn=978-1-85780-270-2\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bergstr\u00f6m\n  |first=Christer\n  |year=2007b\n  |title=Stalingrad&nbsp;\u2014 The Air Battle: November 1942&nbsp;\u2013 February 1943\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Chevron/Ian Allan\n  |isbn=978-1-85780-276-4\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bergstr\u00f6m\n  |first=Christer\n  |year=2015\n  |title=The Battle of Britain: An Epic Conflict Revisited\n  |location=Oxford, UK\n  |publisher=Casemate\n  |isbn=978-1612-00347-4\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bungay\n  |first=Stephen\n  |authorlink=Stephen Bungay\n  |year=2000\n  |title=The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain\n  |location=London, UK\n  |publisher=Aurum Press\n  |isbn=978-1-85410-721-3\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bowman\n  |first=Martin\n  |year=2015\n  |title=The Wellington Bomber\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |publisher=Pen and Sword\n  |isbn=9781473853508\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Caldwell\n  |first1=Donald L.\n  |last2=Muller\n  |first2=Richard R.\n  |authorlink2=Richard R.

They ranged in size from 30 to 300 men, depending on the size of the province and the need for their services by the provincial chiefs and the CIA. District Intelligence and Operation Coordinating Centers (DIOCC) would be staffed by representatives from the CIA\u2019s Census Grievance, PRU, Rural Development and Police Special Branch, along with the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police|National Police]] and Military Security Service. They would be run by the district chief\u2019s S-2 and advised by an American officer. Many of the early PRU units were organized along strictly military lines since they were often employed in military operations against main force VC units. In 1967, when [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support|Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) took over operation of the PRU program, the CIA decided to give the PRU a countrywide presence and a standard table of organization for a PRU team. It was decided that each PRU team would consist of 18 men broken down into three six-man squads. The senior squad leader in each team became the team leader. The idea was to assign an 18-man PRU team to each district so the team could react quickly to any targets identified by the DIOCC in that district. In theory, each province would be given enough PRU teams for one to be assigned to each DIOCC. This new organization went into effect in late 1967 and was maintained until the PRUs were integrated into the National Police in 1973. This new national-level PRU organization resulted in most districts receiving an 18-man PRU team, which meant that small provinces with only a few districts or no districts had fewer than 50 PRU members assigned while larger, more populous provinces with many districts had as many as 300 PRU members assigned. In total, 4,000 to 6,000 Vietnamese PRU personnel were assigned countrywide to the program during the years 1967 to 1973.<ref name=Finlayson>{{cite book|last=Finlayson|first=Andrew|title=Marine Advisors with the Vietnamese Provincial Reconnaissance Units, 1966-1970|publisher=United States Marine Corps History Division|year=2009|url= https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/VN%20Advisors%20Boards_Marine%20Advisors.pdf|isbn= 978-1470097868}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|8}}\n\nA typical post-1967 provincial PRU organization was the one found in [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province]] in [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]. In this organization, each of the four districts in T\u00e2y Ninh Province was assigned an 18-man PRU team and an additional 18-man team was assigned to the capital of the province as a \u201ccity team\u201d that could mount operations in the densely populated [[T\u00e2y Ninh]] or be used to reinforce one or more of the district teams. A very small headquarters cell consisting of the South Vietnamese PRU commander; his deputy, who was also the leader of the T\u00e2y Ninh PRU team; and an operations/intelligence officer provided the staff planning and interagency coordination for the province. According to the Marines assigned to the PRU, this form of organizational structure worked well despite the paucity of personnel assigned to staff duties.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9}}\n\nThe recruitment of PRU personnel varied from province to province. Many PRU members were former VC or former [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) soldiers. Some were former South Vietnamese Special Forces soldiers or former members of a [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group program|Citizen Irregular Defense Group]] (CIDG), while a few were simply local youths who did not want to join the regular ARVN and preferred to serve their country in their own home province. In a few provinces, some paroled criminals were allowed to join the PRU, but the number of such people was few and greatly reduced after 1968. Some had strong religious and community affiliations that made them natural enemies of the VC, such as Catholics, [[Cao Dai]], [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]] and [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] tribesmen. Most PRU members were strongly motivated by their hatred of the VC. Since there were many people in every province who had a grudge against the VC, there were many South Vietnamese who were eager to join the PRU and this made them a very formidable force and one that made it very difficult for the VC to infiltrate or proselytize. According to Colonel Terence M. Allen, the senior military advisor to the PRU Program in Saigon from 1968 to 1970, the most effective PRU teams were those who were recruited among the Cao Dai and Catholic religious communities and the Montagnard tribes since these groups had a visceral hatred of the VC and a vested interest in protecting their communities from the ravages inflicted on them by the VC.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9-10}}\n\nPRU teams were equipped with an assortment of uniforms, weapons, and equipment. Most PRU members dressed in the black pajamas worn by Vietnam\u2019s peasants or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms when they went to the field, but some units actually used VC/[[People\u2019s Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) grey or light green uniforms when such uniforms gave them a tactical advantage. In garrison, most PRU members wore either civilian clothes or the standard PRU tiger-striped camouflage uniform. This wide variety of uniforms made it difficult for both the enemy and friendly units to identify them. Therefore, it was essential that the U.S. PRU advisors coordinate closely with friendly units if the PRU were to operate in areas where U.S. and ARVN units were located. The Marine PRU advisors normally wore black pajamas or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms in the field and civilian clothes while in garrison. Some advisors even wore civilian clothes on PRU operations but this was rare.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|10-1}}\n\nWeapons consisted primarily of [[M16 rifle]]s, [[M1911 pistol|45-caliber pistols]], [[M79 grenade launcher]]s and [[M60 machine gun]]s. However, many PRU units maintained extensive armories of captured weapons, and they often used these in operations against the VC. The PRUs found it convenient to equip some of their men with [[AK-47]] rifles and [[RPG-2|RPG]] grenade launchers, so any VC encountered during an operation in enemy territory would initially think they were fellow VC. This gave the PRUs a distinct tactical advantage in any engagement. Other weapons that were employed by PRU members and their advisors were [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning 9mm]] automatic pistols, [[Colt Cobra]] revolvers, [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]s (BAR), [[M2 Carbine]]s, [[Carl Gustaf m/45|Swedish K submachine gun]]s and [[Bren machine gun]]s. This wide assortment of weapons posed a logistical challenge to some PRU teams, but in most cases there were never any serious shortages of ammunition. Captured enemy ammunition was readily available, and the CIA supply system was able to obtaining almost any ammunition required for operational use. Ammunition for the PRU was often stored within the CIA \u201cembassy house\u201d compounds or in the various PRU armories throughout the provinces so it could be rapidly issued.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|11-2}}\n\nFor communications, the PRUs were equipped with the [[AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver|PRC-25]] radio and its ancillary equipment. A few PRU units maintained some high frequency radios for long-range communications, but such radios were not standard issue, and most PRUs needed to establish temporary radio relay sites on mountaintops to support their long-range missions. This was especially true in the mountainous areas of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]]I Corps. The PRUs were given their own frequencies for tactical communications. They were wary of the enemy intercepting their radio communications, so they seldom used their radios for the transmission of operational details while they were in garrison, choosing instead to use their radios sparingly and primarily during field operations. The PRUs had neither encrypted communications equipment nor code pads, so communications security was often nonexistent, ad hoc, or rudimentary. One of many valuable assets an American PRU advisor brought with him whenever he accompanied a PRU team to the field was the ability to encode communications; however, the use of encoding materials was not frequently employed during most PRU operations, even those that were accompanied by U.S. PRU advisors. Some PRUs did not use radios on their operations, preferring to maintain complete silence until the mission was completed.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nPRU forces were equipped with ground transport in the form of commercial light trucks and motorcycles, which were purchased by the CIA. These trucks and motorcycles were typical of the trucks and motorcycles used by Vietnamese civilians, so their use did not arouse suspicion or draw unwanted attention to them when they were employed by the PRU. It also made repair of these transport assets easy since parts, automotive supplies and repairs could be readily obtained locally. When major repairs were needed, PRU vehicles were taken to the CIA\u2019s automotive repair facility in Saigon. The trucks and motorcycles were never provided in the numbers needed by the PRU. Often, only two to three trucks were given to each province, thus they had to be shared by each district team or kept at province level for use as needed. Most PRU teams suffered because of the lack of organic transport. As a result, the PRUs also used public transportation, such as cyclos and buses, or privately owned motorcycles or bicycles to insert themselves into operational areas. Dressed in civilian clothes and posing as civilian travelers, they were able to blend in with the locals using these modes of transportation until they were near their operational area and ready to engage their targets.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAlthough most PRU operations did not require U.S. military or ARVN transportation assets, the PRUs did avail themselves of such transport when it was provided to them, usually through the good offices of the Vietnamese province chief, a district U.S. military advisor, or the U.S.PRU advisor. For operations over long distances and in mountainous terrain, the PRUs would rely primarily on U.S. helicopters for insertion and extraction. Most U.S. PRU advisors felt the PRUs would have been even more effective had they possessed additional organic transportation assets, such as three-quarter-ton trucks and motorcycles, and a dedicated helicopter package in each military region. The U.S. PRU advisors stated that they often lost valuable time trying to obtain nonorganic transportation for deep or difficult PRU operations, and these delays often had an adverse impact on the success rate of such operations. Since most PRU targets were fleeting in nature, a timely response, often within 24 hours, was needed to achieve success. The lack of organic or rapidly available transportation assets often meant that the target was gone by the time the transportation had been arranged.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12-3}}\n\nThe PRUs were under the operational control of the CIA. However, under an agreement between the GVN and the CIA, the Vietnamese province chiefs were given some control over how and when the PRUs could be used. In some instances, this dual-command relationship caused friction between the local CIA leadership in the province and the province chiefs. The relationship was certainly a violation of the unity of command principle. Theoretically, all PRU operations in a province required both the approval of the provincial officer in charge (POIC), who was the senior CIA officer in the province, and the province chief. In many provinces, the PRUs followed this arrangement, but in some provinces, the CIA disregarded it. Some PRU advisors simply obtained the permission of the POIC and assumed the POIC would get the province chief\u2019s approval. As the program matured, the necessity to fully coordinate PRU arrest orders and operations with the province chiefs became institutionalized.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13}}\n\nThe PRU command and control authority on the Vietnamese side came down from the president through the minister of interior to the province chiefs and finally down to the district chiefs, but this was more administrative than operational since day-to-day operations of the PRUs were planned and executed under the direct supervision of the CIA. In a practical sense, the CIA POICs controlled the PRUs and used the American PRU advisors to ensure the PRU teams were properly employed on counter-VCI operations. A great deal of authority and independence of action was given to the PRU advisors, often amounting to outright autonomy. Since many POICs were busy with their primary duties, not the least of which was the collection of political and strategic intelligence on the enemy\u2019s Central Office South Vietnam (COSVN) and the North Vietnamese government, they simply did not have the time to micromanage the PRU advisor. Also, many POICs lacked military experience or their military experience was dated. This meant that they did not feel they had the technical expertise to plan and control the types of operations the PRUs were conducting and preferred to leave the operational details to the initiative of the American PRU advisors. Because the PRU advisors had a great deal of control over how and when their PRU teams were employed, the job required a level of maturity and sophistication not commonly found among the normal special operations soldier, sailor, or Marine. The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their recommendation that the best men for assignment to this form of duty should be in the age range of 25 to 30 years old and should have obtained at least the equivalent rank of sergeant (E-5) for enlisted and first lieutenant (O-2) for officers. Ideally, they felt the enlisted advisors should be the equivalent of gunnery sergeants (E-7) and the officers should be captains (0-3). The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their belief that immaturity and emotionalism were two of the most destructive and corrosive characteristics a PRU advisor could possess and, along with a lack of cultural sensitivity, the root causes of most serious problems. The number of U.S. military PRU advisors was small; perhaps no more than 400 were assigned to the program from 1967 to 1971.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13-4}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of South Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1973]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = Provincial Reconnaissance Unit\n| native_name = \n| image =\n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| dates = 1967 \u2013 1975\n| country = {{flagicon|South Vietnam}} [[South Vietnam]]\n| allegiance = \n| branch =\n| type = Paramilitary police\n| role = \n| size =\n| command_structure = \n| garrison = \n| garrison_label = \n| nickname =\n| patron = \n| motto = \n| colors = <!-- or | colours = -->\n| colors_label = <!-- or | colours_label = -->\n| equipment = \n| equipment_label = \n| battles = [[Vietnam War]]<br>*[[Phoenix Program]]\n| decorations = \n| battle_honours = \n| battle_honours_label = \n| disbanded = 1973\n| commander1 = \n| commander1_label = \n| commander2 = \n| commander2_label = \n| notable_commanders = <!-- Insignia -->\n| identification_symbol = \n| identification_symbol_label = \n}}\n\nThe '''Provincial Reconnaissance Unit'''s (PRUs) were [[South Vietnam]]ese special police, led by U.S. military and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) personnel, who fought against the political leadership of the [[Vietcong]] (VC) insurgency under the [[Phoenix Program]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==History==\nBefore 1967 the PRUs existed at the provincial level and less than half of the provinces in South Vietnam had such units.

Therefore, it was essential that the U.S. PRU advisors coordinate closely with friendly units if the PRU were to operate in areas where U.S. and ARVN units were located. The Marine PRU advisors normally wore black pajamas or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms in the field and civilian clothes while in garrison. Some advisors even wore civilian clothes on PRU operations but this was rare.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|10-1}}\n\nWeapons consisted primarily of [[M16 rifle]]s, [[M1911 pistol|45-caliber pistols]], [[M79 grenade launcher]]s and [[M60 machine gun]]s. However, many PRU units maintained extensive armories of captured weapons, and they often used these in operations against the VC. The PRUs found it convenient to equip some of their men with [[AK-47]] rifles and [[RPG-2|RPG]] grenade launchers, so any VC encountered during an operation in enemy territory would initially think they were fellow VC. This gave the PRUs a distinct tactical advantage in any engagement. Other weapons that were employed by PRU members and their advisors were [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning 9mm]] automatic pistols, [[Colt Cobra]] revolvers, [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]s (BAR), [[M2 Carbine]]s, [[Carl Gustaf m/45|Swedish K submachine gun]]s and [[Bren machine gun]]s. This wide assortment of weapons posed a logistical challenge to some PRU teams, but in most cases there were never any serious shortages of ammunition. Captured enemy ammunition was readily available, and the CIA supply system was able to obtaining almost any ammunition required for operational use. Ammunition for the PRU was often stored within the CIA \u201cembassy house\u201d compounds or in the various PRU armories throughout the provinces so it could be rapidly issued.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|11-2}}\n\nFor communications, the PRUs were equipped with the [[AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver|PRC-25]] radio and its ancillary equipment. A few PRU units maintained some high frequency radios for long-range communications, but such radios were not standard issue, and most PRUs needed to establish temporary radio relay sites on mountaintops to support their long-range missions. This was especially true in the mountainous areas of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]]I Corps. The PRUs were given their own frequencies for tactical communications. They were wary of the enemy intercepting their radio communications, so they seldom used their radios for the transmission of operational details while they were in garrison, choosing instead to use their radios sparingly and primarily during field operations. The PRUs had neither encrypted communications equipment nor code pads, so communications security was often nonexistent, ad hoc, or rudimentary. One of many valuable assets an American PRU advisor brought with him whenever he accompanied a PRU team to the field was the ability to encode communications; however, the use of encoding materials was not frequently employed during most PRU operations, even those that were accompanied by U.S. PRU advisors. Some PRUs did not use radios on their operations, preferring to maintain complete silence until the mission was completed.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nPRU forces were equipped with ground transport in the form of commercial light trucks and motorcycles, which were purchased by the CIA. These trucks and motorcycles were typical of the trucks and motorcycles used by Vietnamese civilians, so their use did not arouse suspicion or draw unwanted attention to them when they were employed by the PRU. It also made repair of these transport assets easy since parts, automotive supplies and repairs could be readily obtained locally. When major repairs were needed, PRU vehicles were taken to the CIA\u2019s automotive repair facility in Saigon. The trucks and motorcycles were never provided in the numbers needed by the PRU. Often, only two to three trucks were given to each province, thus they had to be shared by each district team or kept at province level for use as needed. Most PRU teams suffered because of the lack of organic transport. As a result, the PRUs also used public transportation, such as cyclos and buses, or privately owned motorcycles or bicycles to insert themselves into operational areas. Dressed in civilian clothes and posing as civilian travelers, they were able to blend in with the locals using these modes of transportation until they were near their operational area and ready to engage their targets.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAlthough most PRU operations did not require U.S. military or ARVN transportation assets, the PRUs did avail themselves of such transport when it was provided to them, usually through the good offices of the Vietnamese province chief, a district U.S. military advisor, or the U.S.PRU advisor. For operations over long distances and in mountainous terrain, the PRUs would rely primarily on U.S. helicopters for insertion and extraction. Most U.S. PRU advisors felt the PRUs would have been even more effective had they possessed additional organic transportation assets, such as three-quarter-ton trucks and motorcycles, and a dedicated helicopter package in each military region. The U.S. PRU advisors stated that they often lost valuable time trying to obtain nonorganic transportation for deep or difficult PRU operations, and these delays often had an adverse impact on the success rate of such operations. Since most PRU targets were fleeting in nature, a timely response, often within 24 hours, was needed to achieve success. The lack of organic or rapidly available transportation assets often meant that the target was gone by the time the transportation had been arranged.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12-3}}\n\nThe PRUs were under the operational control of the CIA. However, under an agreement between the GVN and the CIA, the Vietnamese province chiefs were given some control over how and when the PRUs could be used. In some instances, this dual-command relationship caused friction between the local CIA leadership in the province and the province chiefs. The relationship was certainly a violation of the unity of command principle. Theoretically, all PRU operations in a province required both the approval of the provincial officer in charge (POIC), who was the senior CIA officer in the province, and the province chief. In many provinces, the PRUs followed this arrangement, but in some provinces, the CIA disregarded it. Some PRU advisors simply obtained the permission of the POIC and assumed the POIC would get the province chief\u2019s approval. As the program matured, the necessity to fully coordinate PRU arrest orders and operations with the province chiefs became institutionalized.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13}}\n\nThe PRU command and control authority on the Vietnamese side came down from the president through the minister of interior to the province chiefs and finally down to the district chiefs, but this was more administrative than operational since day-to-day operations of the PRUs were planned and executed under the direct supervision of the CIA. In a practical sense, the CIA POICs controlled the PRUs and used the American PRU advisors to ensure the PRU teams were properly employed on counter-VCI operations. A great deal of authority and independence of action was given to the PRU advisors, often amounting to outright autonomy. Since many POICs were busy with their primary duties, not the least of which was the collection of political and strategic intelligence on the enemy\u2019s Central Office South Vietnam (COSVN) and the North Vietnamese government, they simply did not have the time to micromanage the PRU advisor. Also, many POICs lacked military experience or their military experience was dated. This meant that they did not feel they had the technical expertise to plan and control the types of operations the PRUs were conducting and preferred to leave the operational details to the initiative of the American PRU advisors. Because the PRU advisors had a great deal of control over how and when their PRU teams were employed, the job required a level of maturity and sophistication not commonly found among the normal special operations soldier, sailor, or Marine. The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their recommendation that the best men for assignment to this form of duty should be in the age range of 25 to 30 years old and should have obtained at least the equivalent rank of sergeant (E-5) for enlisted and first lieutenant (O-2) for officers. Ideally, they felt the enlisted advisors should be the equivalent of gunnery sergeants (E-7) and the officers should be captains (0-3). The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their belief that immaturity and emotionalism were two of the most destructive and corrosive characteristics a PRU advisor could possess and, along with a lack of cultural sensitivity, the root causes of most serious problems. The number of U.S. military PRU advisors was small; perhaps no more than 400 were assigned to the program from 1967 to 1971.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13-4}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of South Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1973]]\n", "name_user": "Mztourist", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_Reconnaissance_Unit"}
