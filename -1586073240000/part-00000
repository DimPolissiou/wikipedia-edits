A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.\n\nThe term is often associated with a sudden traumatic [[loss of consciousness]] caused by a physical blow. Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a [[cerebral concussion]] or a [[carotid sinus reflex]] with [[Syncope (medicine)#Blood pressure|syncope]] and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. Body blows, particularly the [[liver punch]], can cause progressive, debilitating pain that can also result in a KO.\n\nIn boxing and kickboxing, a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time, typically because of exhaustion, pain, disorientation, or [[unconsciousness]].

In fighting games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'', a draw is counted as a loss for both players.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:SingletonBox-knockout.jpg|thumb|275px|A knockout can be characterized by unconsciousness.]]\nLittle is known about what exactly causes one to be knocked unconscious, but many agree it is related to trauma to the brain stem. This usually happens when the head rotates sharply, often as a result of a strike. There are three general manifestations of such trauma:\n* a typical knockout, which results in a sustained (three seconds or more) loss of consciousness (comparable to general anesthesia, when the recipient emerges and has lost memory of the event).\n* a \"flash\" knockout, when a very transient (less than three seconds) loss of consciousness occurs (in the context of a knock-down), and the recipient often maintains awareness and memory of the combat.\n* a \"stunning,\" a \"dazing\" or a fighter being \"KO'ed on his feet\", is when basic consciousness is maintained (and the fighter never leaves his feet) despite a general loss of [[awareness]] and extreme distortions in [[proprioception]], balance, visual fields, and auditory processing. Referees are taught specifically to watch for this state, as it cannot be improved by sheer willpower and usually means the fighter is already [[concussion|concussed]] and unable to safely defend themselves.\n\nA basic principle of boxing and other combat sports is to defend against this vulnerability by keeping both hands raised about the face and the chin tucked in. That could still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the [[Celiac_plexus|solar plexus]].\n\nA fighter who becomes unconscious from a [[strike (attack)|strike]] with sufficient [[knockout power]] is referred to as having been ''knocked out'' or ''KO'd'' (''kay-ohd''). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being ''knocked down'' (\"down but not out\"). Repeated blows to the head, regardless whether they cause loss of consciousness, are known to gradually cause permanent [[brain damage]]. In severe cases this may cause [[stroke]]s or [[paralysis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|title=Boxer gets record $22 million settlement from New York in brain injury case|website=mmafighting.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064225/https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|archivedate=2017-09-18}}</ref> This loss of consciousness is commonly known as becoming \"[[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|punch drunk]]\" or \"shot\".

That could still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the [[Celiac_plexus|solar plexus]].\n\nA fighter who becomes unconscious from a [[strike (attack)|strike]] with sufficient [[knockout power]] is referred to as having been ''knocked out'' or ''KO'd'' (''kay-ohd''). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being ''knocked down'' (\"down but not out\"). Repeated blows to the head, regardless whether they cause loss of consciousness, are known to gradually cause permanent [[brain damage]]. In severe cases this may cause [[stroke]]s or [[paralysis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|title=Boxer gets record $22 million settlement from New York in brain injury case|website=mmafighting.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064225/https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|archivedate=2017-09-18}}</ref> This loss of consciousness is commonly known as becoming \"[[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|punch drunk]]\" or \"shot\".

The reason is that Stoney used the approximated value of 10<sup>18</sup> for the number of molecules presented in one cubic millimetre of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]]. Using the modern values for the [[Avogadro constant]] {{physconst|NA|round=5|ref=no}} and for the volume of a [[Mole (unit)|gram-molecule]] (at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|s.t.p.]]) of {{val|22.4146|e=6|u=mm<sup>3</sup>}}, the modern value is {{val|2.687|e=16}}, instead of Stoney's 10<sup>18</sup>.\n\n==Stoney units and Planck units==\n\nThe Stoney length and the Stoney energy, collectively called the ''Stoney scale'', are not far from the Planck length and the Planck energy, the ''Planck scale''. The Stoney scale and the [[Planck scale]] are the length and energy scales at which quantum processes and gravity occur together. At these scales, a [[unified theory]] of physics is thus required. The only notable attempt to construct such a theory from the Stoney scale was that of [[Hermann Weyl|H.

Each party must have resided in the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|British jurisdiction]] in which they intend to register, ([[England and Wales]] or [[Northern Ireland]]) for at least seven days immediately preceding the giving of notice and there will, in most cases, be a fifteen-day waiting period after notice is given. A civil partnership in [[Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Partneriaeth Sifil}}) may be conducted either in English or, provided that both registering parties, the registrar and witnesses are able to understand and write in the [[Welsh language]], in Welsh.  Civil Partnership documents issued in Wales (regardless of the registering language) follow a standardised bilingual English and Welsh format.\n\nIn [[Scotland]] there is no minimum residence requirement to contract a valid partnership. During the waiting period, the proposed partnership is publicised and anyone may make a formal objection. If there is such an objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent the formation of the civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration of the waiting period. The civil partnership must then be registered within twelve months of the notice first being given.\n\nSpecific registration procedures apply to certain special circumstances, e.g. concerning the housebound, detained persons and those seriously ill and in danger of death.\n\n==== Eligibility ====\nEach party to the civil partnership must be at least 16 years of age. Anyone below 18 years of age will usually need parental consent, except in Scotland where such consent is not required. Furthermore, the parties to the proposed partnership must not be within the prohibited degrees of relationship specified in part 1 of schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Act (paragraph 3 was not brought into force <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20053175.htm |title=The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2005 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-11-05}}</ref> following a ruling from the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against similar provisions for marriage).<ref>{{cite news | date=13 September 2005 | url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2005/Sept/ChamberjudgmentBandLvUK130905.htm | title=Chamber Judgment B. and L. v.

Alternatively they can stay married if the spouse signs a statutory declaration that they agree to the gender change changing the opposite sex marriage into a same sex marriage or vice versa. Couple in a civil partnership must convert to marriage or dissolve the partnership before one can obtain legal gender recognition as to avoid an opposite sex civil partnership.\n\n==== Overseas relationships ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nWhere a same-sex couple has registered an overseas relationship which is specified in [[Civil Partnership Act 2004#Schedule 20|Schedule 20]] of the Civil Partnership Act, or meet certain general conditions, they are treated as having formed a civil partnership. The requirements can be found in section 212 and sections 215 to 218 of the Act.\n\nFor an overseas relationship to meet the general conditions it must, under the law of the country or territory in which it was formed:\n\n* be exclusive in nature (i.e., the law must not permit a person to be in a civil or marital relationship with more than one person);\n* be indeterminate in duration (this would exclude an arrangement whereby the parties agreed to live together for a fixed period of time); and\n* result in the parties being treated as a couple (thus excluding local registers which have no legal effects under state/provincial or national law).\n\n=== Legal effect ===\n\n==== Property and financial arrangements ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe position of civil partners in relation to financial arrangements mirrors that of spouses. For instance, Section 11 of the Married Women's Property Act 1882 applies to civil partnerships; thus, money payable to a surviving partner under a policy of life assurance no longer forms part of the deceased partner's estate.\n\nThe laws governing wills, administration of estates and family provisions also applies to civil partners as to spouses; thus, provisions governing financial relief under Part 2 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] (MCA) and the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates' Court Act 1978 also apply to civil partnerships.  Tax exemptions available to spouses under s.18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 are available to civil partners under the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]].  In Scotland the centuries-old system of minimum legal rights to a deceased estate for a widowed spouse were expressly extended to civil partners by section 131 of Act.\n\nIn any dispute between civil partners as to title or possession of property, either partner may apply to the Court, which can then make any order in relation to the property, including an order to sell such property. Contributions by either partner to property improvement are recognised if the contributions are substantial and in actual money or money's worth.\n\n==== Children ====\nWhen dealing with an application for dissolution, nullity or separation where there is a child in the family, the Court must consider if it should exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989. Section 75 amends the definition of 'a child of the family' accordingly.\n\nOther amendments were also made to equalise the position of civil partners with that of spouses. Civil partners are able to acquire parental responsibilities as a stepparent under Section 75 of the Act. They may also apply for residence or contact orders. Further, the right to apply for financial provision for children under schedule 1 of the 1989 act was extended to civil partners. Adoption provisions were amended to treat civil partners the same as married couples in Britain, although this does not apply to Northern Ireland at 18 November 2011.  The Northern Ireland Adoption law is due to go to the judicial review in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15792101 | work=BBC News | title=Law stopping NI gay couples adopting is challenged | date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Other provisions ====\nThe  Act also amended other areas to equalise the position of civil partners. Such areas included matters relating to housing, tenancies and the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. Applicable parts of the Family Law Act 1996 were also amended.\n\n==== Name changing ====\nThere is no requirement that either party must change their surname upon entering a civil partnership. However, many couples wish to follow marital traditions and seek to change their surname to that of either partner, or combine their names to make a [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled surname]]. This change can be made after the civil partnership is registered, and authorities will accept a certificate of civil partnership as evidence of name change, e.g. when applying for a passport or a driving licence. In Scotland, names need not be changed to be considered valid ([[deed poll|deeds poll]] do not exist under Scots law), though some English-based companies may still ask for proof from an official such as a [[Justice of the Peace]]. Civil partners of male [[peerage|peers]] or knights do not receive a [[courtesy title]] to which the spouse of a peer or knight would be entitled.<ref name=\"cnnquote\">{{cite web |quote=The Queen herself knighted Sir Elton John, so his new bride would normally be called a lady.

These provisions broadly mirror those governing marriage.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nNo applications for dissolution may be made within one year of the formation of the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.\n\nAs with the breakdown of a marriage, the court will have powers to provide financial relief upon dissolution of a Civil Partnership.  The court may make Maintenance and lump sum orders, Orders for Sale, Pension Sharing Orders or Property Adjustment Orders.<ref name=\"Civil Partnerships Formation and Dissolution\">{{cite web |url= http://www.furleypage.co.uk/services-for-individuals/civil-partnerships/ |title= Civil Partnerships Formation and Dissolution |publisher= Furley Page |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130420050443/http://www.furleypage.co.uk/services-for-individuals/civil-partnerships/ |archivedate= 2013-04-20 }}</ref>\n\n==== Nullity, separation and presumption of death orders ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nA nullity order is one which annuls a void or voidable civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as to the formation of the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.\n\nA presumption of death order dissolves the partnership on the grounds that one of the partners is presumed to be dead, while a separation order provides for the separation of the parties. These orders are governed by Sections 55 and 56 of the Act and they largely mirror the position for married couples.\n\n==Differences from marriage==\n\nThe contracts of marriage and civil partnerships are very similar though there are some technical differences: [[Venereal disease]] is a grounds for annulment of marriage, but not civil partnership; adultery is a grounds for divorce, but not dissolution of civil union; titles may not be inherited or passed to partners of a civil partnership. Where laws differ for wife and husband, both partners are generally treated like the husband would be. Otherwise, the rules for pensions, survivor benefits, annulment and dissolution are very similar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/264844/131210___1625_SSM_and_civil_partnership_diff_table_1_.doc|title=COMPARISON OF CIVIL PARTNERSHIP AND MARRIAGE FOR SAME SEX COUPLES|publisher=Department of Culture, Media and Sport|date=2013-12-10|access-date=2016-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==The first civil partnerships==\nThe first civil partnership formed under the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] took place at 11:00 GMT 5 December 2005 between Matthew Roche and Christopher Cramp at St Barnabas Hospice, [[Worthing]], [[West Sussex]].

Each party must have resided in the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|British jurisdiction]] in which they intend to register, ([[England and Wales]] or [[Northern Ireland]]) for at least seven days immediately preceding the giving of notice and there will, in most cases, be a fifteen-day waiting period after notice is given. A civil partnership in [[Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Partneriaeth Sifil}}) may be conducted either in English or, provided that both registering parties, the registrar and witnesses are able to understand and write in the [[Welsh language]], in Welsh.  Civil Partnership documents issued in Wales (regardless of the registering language) follow a standardised bilingual English and Welsh format.\n\nIn [[Scotland]] there is no minimum residence requirement to contract a valid partnership. During the waiting period, the proposed partnership is publicised and anyone may make a formal objection. If there is such an objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent the formation of the civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration of the waiting period. The civil partnership must then be registered within twelve months of the notice first being given.\n\nSpecific registration procedures apply to certain special circumstances, e.g. concerning the housebound, detained persons and those seriously ill and in danger of death.\n\n==== Eligibility ====\nEach party to the civil partnership must be at least 16 years of age. Anyone below 18 years of age will usually need parental consent, except in Scotland where such consent is not required. Furthermore, the parties to the proposed partnership must not be within the prohibited degrees of relationship specified in part 1 of schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Act (paragraph 3 was not brought into force <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20053175.htm |title=The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2005 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-11-05}}</ref> following a ruling from the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against similar provisions for marriage).<ref>{{cite news | date=13 September 2005 | url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2005/Sept/ChamberjudgmentBandLvUK130905.htm | title=Chamber Judgment B. and L. v.

Alternatively they can stay married if the spouse signs a statutory declaration that they agree to the gender change changing the opposite sex marriage into a same sex marriage or vice versa. Couple in a civil partnership must convert to marriage or dissolve the partnership before one can obtain legal gender recognition as to avoid an opposite sex civil partnership.\n\n==== Overseas relationships ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nWhere a same-sex couple has registered an overseas relationship which is specified in [[Civil Partnership Act 2004#Schedule 20|Schedule 20]] of the Civil Partnership Act, or meet certain general conditions, they are treated as having formed a civil partnership. The requirements can be found in section 212 and sections 215 to 218 of the Act.\n\nFor an overseas relationship to meet the general conditions it must, under the law of the country or territory in which it was formed:\n\n* be exclusive in nature (i.e., the law must not permit a person to be in a civil or marital relationship with more than one person);\n* be indeterminate in duration (this would exclude an arrangement whereby the parties agreed to live together for a fixed period of time); and\n* result in the parties being treated as a couple (thus excluding local registers which have no legal effects under state/provincial or national law).\n\n=== Legal effect ===\n\n==== Property and financial arrangements ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe position of civil partners in relation to financial arrangements mirrors that of spouses. For instance, Section 11 of the Married Women's Property Act 1882 applies to civil partnerships; thus, money payable to a surviving partner under a policy of life assurance no longer forms part of the deceased partner's estate.\n\nThe laws governing wills, administration of estates and family provisions also applies to civil partners as to spouses; thus, provisions governing financial relief under Part 2 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] (MCA) and the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates' Court Act 1978 also apply to civil partnerships.  Tax exemptions available to spouses under s.18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 are available to civil partners under the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]].  In Scotland the centuries-old system of minimum legal rights to a deceased estate for a widowed spouse were expressly extended to civil partners by section 131 of Act.\n\nIn any dispute between civil partners as to title or possession of property, either partner may apply to the Court, which can then make any order in relation to the property, including an order to sell such property. Contributions by either partner to property improvement are recognised if the contributions are substantial and in actual money or money's worth.\n\n==== Children ====\nWhen dealing with an application for dissolution, nullity or separation where there is a child in the family, the Court must consider if it should exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989. Section 75 amends the definition of 'a child of the family' accordingly.\n\nOther amendments were also made to equalise the position of civil partners with that of spouses. Civil partners are able to acquire parental responsibilities as a stepparent under Section 75 of the Act. They may also apply for residence or contact orders. Further, the right to apply for financial provision for children under schedule 1 of the 1989 act was extended to civil partners. Adoption provisions were amended to treat civil partners the same as married couples in Britain, although this does not apply to Northern Ireland at 18 November 2011.  The Northern Ireland Adoption law is due to go to the judicial review in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15792101 | work=BBC News | title=Law stopping NI gay couples adopting is challenged | date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Other provisions ====\nThe  Act also amended other areas to equalise the position of civil partners. Such areas included matters relating to housing, tenancies and the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. Applicable parts of the Family Law Act 1996 were also amended.\n\n==== Name changing ====\nThere is no requirement that either party must change their surname upon entering a civil partnership. However, many couples wish to follow marital traditions and seek to change their surname to that of either partner, or combine their names to make a [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled surname]]. This change can be made after the civil partnership is registered, and authorities will accept a certificate of civil partnership as evidence of name change, e.g. when applying for a passport or a driving licence. In Scotland, names need not be changed to be considered valid ([[deed poll|deeds poll]] do not exist under Scots law), though some English-based companies may still ask for proof from an official such as a [[Justice of the Peace]]. Civil partners of male [[peerage|peers]] or knights do not receive a [[courtesy title]] to which the spouse of a peer or knight would be entitled.<ref name=\"cnnquote\">{{cite web |quote=The Queen herself knighted Sir Elton John, so his new bride would normally be called a lady.

These provisions broadly mirror those governing marriage.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nNo applications for dissolution may be made within one year of the formation of the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.\n\nAs with the breakdown of a marriage, the court will have powers to provide financial relief upon dissolution of a Civil Partnership.  The court may make Maintenance and lump sum orders, Orders for Sale, Pension Sharing Orders or Property Adjustment Orders.<ref name=\"Civil Partnerships Formation and Dissolution\">{{cite web |url= http://www.furleypage.co.uk/services-for-individuals/civil-partnerships/ |title= Civil Partnerships Formation and Dissolution |publisher= Furley Page |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130420050443/http://www.furleypage.co.uk/services-for-individuals/civil-partnerships/ |archivedate= 2013-04-20 }}</ref>\n\n==== Nullity, separation and presumption of death orders ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nA nullity order is one which annuls a void or voidable civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as to the formation of the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.\n\nA presumption of death order dissolves the partnership on the grounds that one of the partners is presumed to be dead, while a separation order provides for the separation of the parties. These orders are governed by Sections 55 and 56 of the Act and they largely mirror the position for married couples.\n\n==Differences from marriage==\n\nThe contracts of marriage and civil partnerships are very similar though there are some technical differences: [[Venereal disease]] is a grounds for annulment of marriage, but not civil partnership; adultery is a grounds for divorce, but not dissolution of civil union; titles may not be inherited or passed to partners of a civil partnership. Where laws differ for wife and husband, both partners are generally treated like the husband would be. Otherwise, the rules for pensions, survivor benefits, annulment and dissolution are very similar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/264844/131210___1625_SSM_and_civil_partnership_diff_table_1_.doc|title=COMPARISON OF CIVIL PARTNERSHIP AND MARRIAGE FOR SAME SEX COUPLES|publisher=Department of Culture, Media and Sport|date=2013-12-10|access-date=2016-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==The first civil partnerships==\nThe first civil partnership formed under the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] took place at 11:00 GMT 5 December 2005 between Matthew Roche and Christopher Cramp at St Barnabas Hospice, [[Worthing]], [[West Sussex]].
