{"title_page": "Shaking the dust from the feet", "text_new": "'''Shaking the dust from the feet''' was a practice of pious Jews during [[New Testament]] times.  When Jesus called his [[Twelve Apostles|twelve disciples]], he told them to perform the same act against the non-believing Jews.\nDIe \n\n\nIn the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] of the 19th century, it was practiced much as recorded in the New Testament, but later fell out of use. Other Christian groups and organizations typically do not see this as a practice that should be followed, or as something not to be taken literally.\n\n==New Testament==\nIn Biblical times, when leaving [[Gentile]] cities, pious Jews often shook the dust from their feet to show their separation from Gentile practices.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}If the disciples shook the dust of a Jewish town from their feet, it would show their separation from Jews who rejected their Messiah. The gesture was to show the people that they were making a wrong choice. The opportunity to choose Christ might not present itself again. According to the [[New Testament]], when [[Jesus]] called his [[Twelve Apostles|twelve disciples]], he sent them into Jewish lands and told them, in a reversal, to perform the same act against the non-believing Jews ({{lds|Matthew|matt|10|14}}), and \"it shall be more tolerable for the land of [[Sodom and Gomorrha]] in the day of judgment, than for that city\" ({{lds|Matthew|matt|10|15}}). The only recorded instance of this practice in the New Testament was when [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Barnabas]] were expelled from [[Antioch, Pisidia]] by Jews who disapproved of them teaching to [[Gentile]]s ({{lds|Acts|acts|13|50|51}}).\n\n==Latter Day Saint movement==\n===Reintroduction===\nIn July 1830, [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], dictated his first [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] referencing the practice, said to be the words of Jesus directed to Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]], directing them as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|p=57}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>And in whatsoever place ye shall enter, and they receive you not, in my name ye shall leave a cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the dust of your feet against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1831, a revelation clarified that when leaving a cursing upon a person in this way, the shaking of dust and washing of feet should be performed \"not in their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|p=144}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1832, one of Smith's revelations directed several missionaries to use the practice, and indicated that when performed against a house, the missionaries:<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=222}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>shall be filled with joy and gladness and know this, that in the day of judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them, and it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for that house.</blockquote>\n\nAfter referring again to the practice in an August 29, 1832, revelation,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=206}}</ref> Smith gave his final revelation on the subject on September 22\u201323, 1832. This revelation, directed to those ordained to the newly established [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priesthood]], indicated that when a person does not receive a traveling high priest, or give them food, clothing, or money, they should<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=93}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>go away from him alone by yourselves, and cleanse your feet, even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father, and return not again unto that man. And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise.</blockquote>\n\n===Early practice===\nThe first recorded practice of shaking the dust from the feet was by Smith's brother [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.

Most notably, it was performed on January 19, 1881, by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] against a list of 400 people considered \"Enemies of the Kingdom of God\" because of their activism against Mormon [[polygamy]].<ref>Susan Staker, \"Waiting for World's End\" p. XVII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> In 1899, however, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued a direction to [[mission president]]s to stop using it as a routine practice, but only where there is just cause and when moved by the [[Holy Spirit]].\n\nIn 1915, the influential [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[James E. Talmage]] provided his opinion that the practice should occur only in \"unusual and extreme conditions\":<ref>{{Citation |last= Talmage |first= James E. |authorlink= James E. Talmage |title= [[Jesus the Christ (book)|Jesus the Christ: A Study of the Messiah and His Mission According to the Holy Scriptures Both Ancient and Modern]] |year= 1915 |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= Deseret News |lccn= 52056531 |oclc= 3257868 |page= 345}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nTo ceremonially shake the dust from one's feet as a testimony against another was understood by the Jews to symbolize a cessation of fellowship and a renunciation of all responsibility for consequences that might follow. It became an ordinance of accusation and testimony by the Lord's instructions to His apostles as cited in the text [of the New Testament]. In the current dispensation, the Lord has similarly directed His authorized servants to so testify against those who wilfully and maliciously oppose the truth when authoritatively presented (see Doctrine and Covenants 24:15; 60:15; 75:20; 84:92; 99:4). The responsibility of testifying before the Lord by this accusing symbol is so great that the means may be employed only under unusual and extreme conditions, as the Spirit of the Lord may direct.\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the early-20th century, the practice has been rare. Nevertheless, there have been further doctrinal developments by LDS Church leaders and scholars. According to [[J.

When Jesus called his [[Twelve Apostles|twelve disciples]], he told them to perform the same act against the non-believing Jews.\n\nIn the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] of the 19th century, it was practiced much as recorded in the New Testament, but later fell out of use. Other Christian groups and organizations typically do not see this as a practice that should be followed, or as something not to be taken literally.\n\n==New Testament==\nIn Biblical times, when leaving [[Gentile]] cities, pious Jews often shook the dust from their feet to show their separation from Gentile practices.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}If the disciples shook the dust of a Jewish town from their feet, it would show their separation from Jews who rejected their Messiah. The gesture was to show the people that they were making a wrong choice. The opportunity to choose Christ might not present itself again. According to the [[New Testament]], when [[Jesus]] called his [[Twelve Apostles|twelve disciples]], he sent them into Jewish lands and told them, in a reversal, to perform the same act against the non-believing Jews ({{lds|Matthew|matt|10|14}}), and \"it shall be more tolerable for the land of [[Sodom and Gomorrha]] in the day of judgment, than for that city\" ({{lds|Matthew|matt|10|15}}). The only recorded instance of this practice in the New Testament was when [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Barnabas]] were expelled from [[Antioch, Pisidia]] by Jews who disapproved of them teaching to [[Gentile]]s ({{lds|Acts|acts|13|50|51}}).\n\n==Latter Day Saint movement==\n===Reintroduction===\nIn July 1830, [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], dictated his first [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] referencing the practice, said to be the words of Jesus directed to Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]], directing them as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|p=57}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>And in whatsoever place ye shall enter, and they receive you not, in my name ye shall leave a cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the dust of your feet against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1831, a revelation clarified that when leaving a cursing upon a person in this way, the shaking of dust and washing of feet should be performed \"not in their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|p=144}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1832, one of Smith's revelations directed several missionaries to use the practice, and indicated that when performed against a house, the missionaries:<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=222}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>shall be filled with joy and gladness and know this, that in the day of judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them, and it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for that house.</blockquote>\n\nAfter referring again to the practice in an August 29, 1832, revelation,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=206}}</ref> Smith gave his final revelation on the subject on September 22\u201323, 1832. This revelation, directed to those ordained to the newly established [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priesthood]], indicated that when a person does not receive a traveling high priest, or give them food, clothing, or money, they should<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=93}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>go away from him alone by yourselves, and cleanse your feet, even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father, and return not again unto that man. And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise.</blockquote>\n\n===Early practice===\nThe first recorded practice of shaking the dust from the feet was by Smith's brother [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.

Most notably, it was performed on January 19, 1881, by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] against a list of 400 people considered \"Enemies of the Kingdom of God\" because of their activism against Mormon [[polygamy]].<ref>Susan Staker, \"Waiting for World's End\" p. XVII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> In 1899, however, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued a direction to [[mission president]]s to stop using it as a routine practice, but only where there is just cause and when moved by the [[Holy Spirit]].\n\nIn 1915, the influential [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[James E. Talmage]] provided his opinion that the practice should occur only in \"unusual and extreme conditions\":<ref>{{Citation |last= Talmage |first= James E. |authorlink= James E.

It became an ordinance of accusation and testimony by the Lord's instructions to His apostles as cited in the text [of the New Testament]. In the current dispensation, the Lord has similarly directed His authorized servants to so testify against those who wilfully and maliciously oppose the truth when authoritatively presented (see Doctrine and Covenants 24:15; 60:15; 75:20; 84:92; 99:4). The responsibility of testifying before the Lord by this accusing symbol is so great that the means may be employed only under unusual and extreme conditions, as the Spirit of the Lord may direct.\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the early-20th century, the practice has been rare. Nevertheless, there have been further doctrinal developments by LDS Church leaders and scholars. According to [[J. Reuben Clark]], a mid-century member of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the ritual of shaking the dust off one's feet is a manifestation of a priesthood holder's \"power to determine whether sins should be forgiven, or retained\"<ref>[[J.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series was produced by [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] and continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers. Favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] were also featured.\n\nHer ''Carol Burnett Show'' co-stars Tim Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] were back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series was produced by [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] and continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers, including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] were also featured.\n\nHer ''Carol Burnett Show'' co-stars Tim Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] were back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!

One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his [[Newspaper delivery|paper round]] and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\nJeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then [[Luton Sixth Form College]].<ref name=\"UofL 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |title=The Gene Genius |date=September 2004 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=17 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109215809/http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> He won a scholarship to study at [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1972 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in [[biochemistry]].<ref name=CV-AJ/> Jeffreys completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree on the [[mitochondria]] of cultured mammalian cells, as a postgraduate student at the Genetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford.<ref name=jeffreysphd>{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Alec|last=Jeffreys |title=Studies on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1975 |url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph019879695|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.460797}}|oclc=500483911}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\n[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|Alec Jeffreys]]\nAfter finishing his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow,<ref name = \"UofL 2004\"/> and then to the [[University of Leicester]] in 1977, where in 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing [[genetic fingerprinting]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/>\n\n===Genetic fingerprinting===\nJeffreys says he had a \"[[eureka moment]]\" in his lab in Leicester after looking at the [[X-ray]] film image of a [[DNA]] experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/> Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has become important in [[forensic science]] to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife [[population genetics]] studies.<ref name=\"DNA Fingerprinting Zoology 2014\" /> Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name=\"welcome 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nJeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s 1989 best selling book ''The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders'' and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 1 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series ''[[Forensic Files|Medical Detectives]]'' in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, [[Code of a Killer]]. In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a [[femur]] bone of his exhumed skeleton,<ref name = \"nature med 2005\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = J. | title = Ten years of biotech gaffes|doi = 10.1038/nbt0306-270|journal = Nature Biotechnology|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 270\u2013273|year = 2006|pmid =  16525384|pmc =}}</ref> with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\n===DNA profiling===\n[[DNA profiling]], based on typing individual highly variable [[minisatellite]]s in the [[human genome]], was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985,<ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 314 \n|issue = 6006 \n|pages = 67\u201373 \n|year = 1985 \n|pmid = 3856104\n|doi=10.1038/314067a0\n| bibcode = 1985Natur.314...67J \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 316 \n|issue = 6023 \n|pages = 76\u201379 \n|year = 1975\n|pmid = 2989708\n|doi=10.1038/316076a0\n}}</ref> with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many [[minisatellite]]s simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and [[paternity testing]] worldwide.\n\nThe development of DNA amplification by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable [[microsatellite]]s, also known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the [[Joseph Mengele|Mengele]] case.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Allen | first2 = M. \n| last3 = Hagelberg | first3 = E. |authorlink3=Erika Hagelberg\n| last4 = Sonnberg | first4 = A. \n| title = Identification of the skeletal remains of Josef Mengele by DNA analysis \n| journal = Forensic Science International \n| volume = 56 \n| issue = 1 \n| pages = 65\u201376 \n| year = 1992 \n| pmid = 1398379 | doi=10.1016/0379-0738(92)90148-P\n}}</ref> STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD) in 1995.{{fact|date=March 2018}} With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland).<ref name=\"DNA and Crime Investigation: Scotland and the UK National DNA Database\"/> The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database,<ref name=\"The informer in your blood\"/> and has instead proposed a database of all people's

One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his [[Newspaper delivery|paper round]] and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\nJeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then [[Luton Sixth Form College]].<ref name=\"UofL 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |title=The Gene Genius |date=September 2004 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=17 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109215809/http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> He won a scholarship to study at [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1972 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in [[biochemistry]].<ref name=CV-AJ/> Jeffreys completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree on the [[mitochondria]] of cultured mammalian cells, as a postgraduate student at the Genetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford.<ref name=jeffreysphd>{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Alec|last=Jeffreys |title=Studies on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1975 |url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph019879695|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.460797}}|oclc=500483911}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\n[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|Alec Jeffreys]]\nAfter finishing his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow,<ref name = \"UofL 2004\"/> and then to the [[University of Leicester]] in 1977, where in 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing [[genetic fingerprinting]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/>\n\n===Genetic fingerprinting===\nJeffreys says he had a \"[[eureka moment]]\" in his lab in Leicester after looking at the [[X-ray]] film image of a [[DNA]] experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/> Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has become important in [[forensic science]] to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife [[population genetics]] studies.<ref name=\"DNA Fingerprinting Zoology 2014\" /> Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name=\"welcome 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nJeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s 1989 best selling book ''The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders'' and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 1 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series ''[[Forensic Files|Medical Detectives]]'' in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, [[Code of a Killer]]. In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a [[femur]] bone of his exhumed skeleton,<ref name = \"nature med 2005\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = J. | title = Ten years of biotech gaffes|doi = 10.1038/nbt0306-270|journal = Nature Biotechnology|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 270\u2013273|year = 2006|pmid =  16525384|pmc =}}</ref> with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\n===DNA profiling===\n[[DNA profiling]], based on typing individual highly variable [[minisatellite]]s in the [[human genome]], was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985,<ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 314 \n|issue = 6006 \n|pages = 67\u201373 \n|year = 1985 \n|pmid = 3856104\n|doi=10.1038/314067a0\n| bibcode = 1985Natur.314...67J \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 316 \n|issue = 6023 \n|pages = 76\u201379 \n|year = 1975\n|pmid = 2989708\n|doi=10.1038/316076a0\n}}</ref> with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many [[minisatellite]]s simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and [[paternity testing]] worldwide.\n\nThe development of DNA amplification by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable [[microsatellite]]s, also known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the [[Joseph Mengele|Mengele]] case.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Allen | first2 = M. \n| last3 = Hagelberg | first3 = E. |authorlink3=Erika Hagelberg\n| last4 = Sonnberg | first4 = A. \n| title = Identification of the skeletal remains of Josef Mengele by DNA analysis \n| journal = Forensic Science International \n| volume = 56 \n| issue = 1 \n| pages = 65\u201376 \n| year = 1992 \n| pmid = 1398379 | doi=10.1016/0379-0738(92)90148-P\n}}</ref> STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD) in 1995.{{fact|date=March 2018}} With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland).<ref name=\"DNA and Crime Investigation: Scotland and the UK National DNA Database\"/> The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database,<ref name=\"The informer in your blood\"/> and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.<ref name=\"Privacy fears over DNA database\"/>\n\n===Awards and honours===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* 1986 \u2013 Elected a
