Sources differ.--> is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is noted for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[melisma]]tic singing style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]]. She rose to fame in 1990 after signing to [[Columbia Records]] and releasing her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]], which topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for eleven consecutive weeks. Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from \"[[Vision of Love]]\" to \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\".\n\nIn 1993, Carey married [[Sony Music]] head [[Tommy Mottola]], the man who signed her to Columbia. She achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\", \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\", as well as \"[[One Sweet Day]]\", which later became Billboard's Song Of The Decade (1990s). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the country's most successful artist of the 1990s, while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s, and the best-selling female artist of the millennium.\n\nAfter eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $100&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]]. However, following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]], as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its accompanying [[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], her contract was bought out for $50 million by Virgin and she signed with [[Island Records]] the next year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), which became the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, \"[[We Belong Together]]\", became the U.S. best-performing single of the 2000s. In 2009, she was cast in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', which won her Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]].\n\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time. With a total of 19 songs topping the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, Carey holds the record for the most number-one singles by [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|a solo artist]], [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Songwriters with the most number-one singles|a female songwriter]], and a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Producers with the most number-one singles|female producer]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one|title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait|first=Gary|last=Trust|magazine=Billboard|date=December 16, 2019|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), she is the [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|second highest-certified female artist]] in the United States, with 66.5 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[album-equivalent units|album units]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=RIAA|title=2 #Diamond albums, 7 #multiPlatinum albums, 4 #Platinum albums, 2 #Gold albums.

Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at the age of three, often imitating her mother's take on [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian.

Though a classically trained opera singer, Patricia never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom.

Sources differ.--> is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is noted for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[melisma]]tic singing style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]]. She rose to fame in 1990 after signing to [[Columbia Records]] and releasing her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]], which topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for eleven consecutive weeks. Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from \"[[Vision of Love]]\" to \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\".\n\nIn 1993, Carey married [[Sony Music]] head [[Tommy Mottola]], the man who signed her to Columbia. She achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\", \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\", as well as \"[[One Sweet Day]]\", which later became Billboard's Song Of The Decade (1990s). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the country's most successful artist of the 1990s, while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s, and the best-selling female artist of the millennium.\n\nAfter eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $100&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]]. However, following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]], as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its accompanying [[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], her contract was bought out for $50 million by Virgin and she signed with [[Island Records]] the next year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), which became the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, \"[[We Belong Together]]\", became the U.S. best-performing single of the 2000s. In 2009, she was cast in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', which won her Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]].\n\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time. With a total of 19 songs topping the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, Carey holds the record for the most number-one singles by [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|a solo artist]], [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Songwriters with the most number-one singles|a female songwriter]], and a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Producers with the most number-one singles|female producer]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one|title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait|first=Gary|last=Trust|magazine=Billboard|date=December 16, 2019|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), she is the [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|second highest-certified female artist]] in the United States, with 66.5 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[album-equivalent units|album units]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=RIAA|title=2 #Diamond albums, 7 #multiPlatinum albums, 4 #Platinum albums, 2 #Gold albums.

Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at the age of three, often imitating her mother's take on [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian.

Though a classically trained opera singer, Patricia never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom.

The City of Ammon experienced a 123.3% growth rate from 2000 to 2010 based on the 2010 US Census. Ammon is currently the 15th largest city in [[Idaho]].\n\nThe City's rapid growth is due to the comfortable residential lifestyle, availability of affordable housing, and proximity to strong local job market.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Monument in Ammon Idaho.JPG|thumb|left|A monument erected in 1937 by local [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] honors the early settlers of Ammon]]Ammon was founded by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1888.<ref>[[Andrew Jenson]].

The area was made a ward in the church in 1889 with Arthur M. Rawson as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]], who renamed the town in honor of [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]], a figure in the LDS book of scripture, the [[Book of Mormon]].  Since it was now independent of the Iona Ward, a new name seemed appropriate. On February 9, 1893, the name of the town was changed from South Iona Ward to Ammon.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Jenson\n| first     = Andrew\n| title     = Church chronology: a record of important events pertaining to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n| publisher = BiblioBazaar\n| isbn      = 1-115-24708-5\n| year      = 2009\n| page      = 201\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 1930 the village of Ammon had 270 inhabitants, but the total district of Ammon, which is how the name is usually used and is closer to the modern borders, had a population of about 1100.<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 22</ref>\n\nAmmon was an early agricultural center and later was home to several general stores, a grain elevator and a brickyard. The city was officially incorporated on October 10, 1905. It became a Second Class City under Idaho law in 1963. In the early 1900s a spur line was built by the Union Pacific Railroad to the Ammon Elevator. Beginning in the 1940s housing divisions have aided the city's growth and it has become a [[suburb]] for the adjacent city of [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]]. Building boomed in the 1990s in both the business and housing sectors, and the city was one of the fastest growing in Idaho from 2000 to 2010.\n\n==Education==\nAmmon is served by the [[Bonneville Joint School District #93]]. District #93 serves about 10,758 students in 19 schools, making it the fifth-largest by enrollment in the state of [[Idaho]].

The City of Ammon experienced a 123.3% growth rate from 2000 to 2010 based on the 2010 US Census. Ammon is currently the 15th largest city in [[Idaho]].\n\nThe City's rapid growth is due to the comfortable residential lifestyle, availability of affordable housing, and proximity to strong local job market.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Monument in Ammon Idaho.JPG|thumb|left|A monument erected in 1937 by local [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] honors the early settlers of Ammon]]Ammon was founded by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1888.<ref>[[Andrew Jenson]].

(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 22</ref><ref>Old Ammon: ''The First Fifty Years''. by Miranda Stringham, Ricks College Press, Rexburg, Idaho, 1984</ref> It was originally called South Iona because it was the dependent branch in the south end of the [[Iona, Idaho]] ward. The area was made a ward in the church in 1889 with Arthur M. Rawson as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]], who renamed the town in honor of [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]], a figure in the LDS book of scripture, the [[Book of Mormon]].  Since it was now independent of the Iona Ward, a new name seemed appropriate. On February 9, 1893, the name of the town was changed from South Iona Ward to Ammon.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Jenson\n| first     = Andrew\n| title     = Church chronology: a record of important events pertaining to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n| publisher = BiblioBazaar\n| isbn      = 1-115-24708-5\n| year      = 2009\n| page      = 201\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 1930 the village of Ammon had 270 inhabitants, but the total district of Ammon, which is how the name is usually used and is closer to the modern borders, had a population of about 1100.<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 22</ref>\n\nAmmon was an early agricultural center and later was home to several general stores, a grain elevator and a brickyard. The city was officially incorporated on October 10, 1905. It became a Second Class City under Idaho law in 1963. In the early 1900s a spur line was built by the Union Pacific Railroad to the Ammon Elevator. Beginning in the 1940s housing divisions have aided the city's growth and it has become a [[suburb]] for the adjacent city of [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]]. Building boomed in the 1990s in both the business and housing sectors, and the city was one of the fastest growing in Idaho from 2000 to 2010.\n\n==Education==\nAmmon is served by the [[Bonneville Joint School District #93]]. District #93 serves about 10,758 students in 19 schools, making it the fifth-largest by enrollment in the state of [[Idaho]]. The district has: 13 elementary schools serving students in K-6, two middle schools serving students in grades 7-8, and three high schools serving students in grades 9-12, along with an alternative high school.\n \n===High schools=== \n* [[Bonnevile Online High School (Idaho)|Bonnevile Online High School]]\n* [[Bonneville High School (Idaho)|Bonneville High School]]\n[[Image:Bonneville High School Idaho.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Southeast Entrance of Bonneville High School]]\n* [[Hillcrest High School (Idaho)|Hillcrest High School]]\n[[Image:Hillcrest High School in Ammon Idaho.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The west entrance to Hillcrest High School]]\n*[http://www.d93schools.org/28/home Thunder Ridge High School]\n\n===Alternative high schools===\n* Lincoln Alternative High School\n \n===Middle schools===\n* Rocky Mountain Middle School\n* Sandcreek Middle School\n \n===Elementary schools===\n* Ammon Elementary School\n* Bridgewater Elementary School\n* Cloverdale Elementary School\n* Discovery Elementary School\n* Fairview Elementary School\n* Falls Valley Elementary School\n* Hillview Elementary School\n* Iona Elementary School\n* Mountain Valley Elementary School\n* Rimrock Elementary School\n* Summit Hills Elementary School\n* Tiebreaker Elementary School\n* Ucon Elementary School\n* Woodland Hills Elementary School\n\n==Geography==\nAmmon is located at {{coord|43|28|35|N|111|58|5|W|type:city}} (43.476268, -111.967964).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|7.26|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 214\n|1920= 378\n|1930= 270\n|1940= 363\n|1950= 447\n|1960= 1882\n|1970= 2545\n|1980= 4669\n|1990= 5002\n|2000= 6187\n|2010= 13816\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16475\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Ammon City Building.JPG|thumb|left|The Ammon City Building]]\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> of 2010, there were 13,816 people, 4,476 households, and 3,352 families residing in the city.

In 1807 as population increased, the county was reduced in size in order to form [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]].  Tobacco was the major [[cash crop]] of the county during its early years. The labor-intensive crop was worked and processed by enslaved Africans and African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the rural county was 32,353, a small increase from the 31,894 people reported in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51009.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Amherst.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]], called the \"Conqueror of Canada\", for whom the county was named]]\nBeginning thousands of years in the past, Native Americans were the first humans to populate the area. They hunted and fished mainly along the countless rivers and streams in the county. With the establishment of the Virginia Colony in 1607, English emigrants arrived in North America. By the late 17th century English explorers and traders had traveled up the James River to this area. Early trading posts were established between 1710 and 1720. By 1730, many new English colonial families moved into the area currently known as Amherst County, drawn by the desire for land and the good tobacco-growing soil.\n\nAmherst County was formed in 1761, from part of southwestern [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]].  The original county seat had been in Cabelsville, now [[Colleen, Virginia|Colleen]], in what would later become Nelson County. The county was named for [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Amherst]], known as the \"Conqueror of [[Canada]]\", who commanded the British forces that successfully secured Canada from the French during the Seven Years' War. Jeffery Amherst had previously been named as [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]], although he never came to this colony.\n\nIn 1806 the county took its present proportions, when Nelson County was formed from its northern half. At that point, the county seat was moved to the village of Five Oaks, later renamed Amherst. The present county courthouse was built in 1870 and has served the county ever since. Amherst County produced more Confederate soldiers per capita than anywhere else in the Confederate States of America{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\nIn the early days, the major crop raised in Amherst County was tobacco.  Apple orchards were part of mixed farming that replaced tobacco, especially in the late 19th century. Timber, mining and milling were also important industries. The introduction of the railroad in the late 19th century greatly influenced the county's growth. The county contains many good examples of 18th, 19th and early 20th century rural and small town architecture. The downtown area of Amherst is a classic example of early 20th century commercial architecture.\n\n==Recreation and attractions==\n\nRecreational attractions are located throughout the county. There are four recreational and public lakes, namely Mill Creek, Thrashers Lake, Otter Lake and Stonehouse Lake, which offer opportunities to fish, canoe or kayak.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lakes |url=https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/lakes/ |publisher=Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries |accessdate=5 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  There are many parks and trails in the county, including about 25 miles of the [[Appalachian Trail]], which runs through the [[George Washington National Forest]].<ref name=\"Trails\">{{cite web |title=Trails |url=https://www.countyofamherst.com/department/division.php?fDD=23-94 |website=www.countyofamherst.com |publisher=Amherst County, Virginia |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> Offshoot trails lead to peaks in Amherst, such at Mount Pleasant, Cole Mountain, and Tar Jacket Ridge.<ref name=\"Trails\"/>\n\n==Festivals in the area==\n* Rebec Vineyard's Garlic Festival\n* Lazy Days Vineyard's Summer Solstice Festival\n* Amherst County Sorghum Festival\n* The Batteau Festival\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:U.S. Route 29 in Madison Heights.jpg|thumbnail|right|Looking toward U.S. 29 in Madison Heights]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|479|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|474|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties / Independent city===\n* [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Nelson County, Virginia]] \u2013 northeast\n* [[Appomattox County, Virginia]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[Campbell County, Virginia]] \u2013 south\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] \u2013 south (independent city)\n* [[Bedford County, Virginia]] \u2013 southwest\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)\n* [[George Washington National Forest]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|29}} (N & S Amherst Hwy, S.

In 1807 as population increased, the county was reduced in size in order to form [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]].  Tobacco was the major [[cash crop]] of the county during its early years. The labor-intensive crop was worked and processed by enslaved Africans and African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the rural county was 32,353, a small increase from the 31,894 people reported in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51009.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Amherst.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]], called the \"Conqueror of Canada\", for whom the county was named]]\nBeginning thousands of years in the past, Native Americans were the first humans to populate the area. They hunted and fished mainly along the countless rivers and streams in the county. With the establishment of the Virginia Colony in 1607, English emigrants arrived in North America. By the late 17th century English explorers and traders had traveled up the James River to this area. Early trading posts were established between 1710 and 1720. By 1730, many new English colonial families moved into the area currently known as Amherst County, drawn by the desire for land and the good tobacco-growing soil.\n\nAmherst County was formed in 1761, from part of southwestern [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]].  The original county seat had been in Cabelsville, now [[Colleen, Virginia|Colleen]], in what would later become Nelson County. The county was named for [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Amherst]], known as the \"Conqueror of [[Canada]]\", who commanded the British forces that successfully secured Canada from the French during the Seven Years War. Jeffery Amherst had previously been named as [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]], although he never came to this colony.\n\nIn 1806 the county took its present proportions, when Nelson County was formed from its northern half. At that point, the county seat was moved to the village of Five Oaks, later renamed Amherst. The present county courthouse was built in 1870 and has served the county ever since. Amherst County produced more Confederate soldiers per capita than anywhere else in the Confederate States of America{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\nIn the early days, the major crop raised in Amherst County was tobacco.  Apple orchards were part of mixed farming that replaced tobacco, especially in the late 19th century. Timber, mining and milling were also important industries. The introduction of the railroad in the late 19th century greatly influenced the county's growth. The county contains many good examples of 18th, 19th and early 20th century rural and small town architecture. The downtown area of Amherst is a classic example of early 20th century commercial architecture.\n\n==Recreation and attractions==\n\nRecreational attractions are located throughout the county. There are four recreational and public lakes, namely Mill Creek, Thrashers Lake, Otter Lake and Stonehouse Lake, which offer opportunities to fish, canoe or kayak.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lakes |url=https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/lakes/ |publisher=Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries |accessdate=5 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  There are many parks and trails in the county, including about 25 miles of the [[Appalachian Trail]], which runs through the [[George Washington National Forest]].<ref name=\"Trails\">{{cite web |title=Trails |url=https://www.countyofamherst.com/department/division.php?fDD=23-94 |website=www.countyofamherst.com |publisher=Amherst County, Virginia |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> Offshoot trails lead to peaks in Amherst, such at Mount Pleasant, Cole Mountain, and Tar Jacket Ridge.<ref name=\"Trails\"/>\n\n==Festivals in the area==\n* Rebec Vineyard's Garlic Festival\n* Lazy Days Vineyard's Summer Solstice Festival\n* Amherst County Sorghum Festival\n* The Batteau Festival\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:U.S. Route 29 in Madison Heights.jpg|thumbnail|right|Looking toward U.S. 29 in Madison Heights]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|479|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|474|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties / Independent city===\n* [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Nelson County, Virginia]] \u2013 northeast\n* [[Appomattox County, Virginia]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[Campbell County, Virginia]] \u2013 south\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] \u2013 south (independent city)\n* [[Bedford County, Virginia]] \u2013 southwest\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)\n* [[George Washington National Forest]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|29}} (N & S Amherst Hwy, S.
