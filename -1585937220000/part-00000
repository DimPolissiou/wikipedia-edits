The municipality lies in the valley of the [[Leie River]], between [[Kortrijk]] and [[Ghent]].  It is part of the arrondissement of Kortrijk and comprises the towns of [[Beveren, Waregem|Beveren]], [[Desselgem]], [[Sint-Eloois-Vijve]] and Waregem proper.  On January 1, 2019, Waregem had a total population of 38,260. The total area is 44.34&nbsp;km\u00b2 which gives a [[population density]] of 863 inhabitants per km\u00b2.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe first inhabitants of this forested region settled along the [[Leie River]] well before [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.  Bronze coins and artifacts associated with the [[Gallo-Roman culture]] show extensive activity in this area in the first centuries of our era.  This is not surprising given the fact that Sint-Eloois-Vijve stood at the intersection of two important Roman roads: [[Cassel, France|Cassel]]-[[Tongeren]] and [[Bavai]]-[[Oudenburg]].  The name of the current municipality refers to a certain \u201cWaro\u201d clan or tribe, possibly dating from the [[Franks|Frankish]] period.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Image:Sint-Eloois-Vijve Sint-Eligius kerk-1.JPG|thumb|left|St-Eloois-Vijve Church]]\n\nIn the 10th century, most of Waregem's territory was given as a grant to the St Peter Abbey in [[Ghent]].  The local administrative center used by the [[Benedictines]] along the [[Leie River]] can still be seen today and is still known as the ''Munkenhof.''  At the end of the century, [[Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders]], made this area the base from which he could advance against [[Kortrijk]].  During the following centuries, the medieval feudal system allowed the land to be progressively parceled out to landowners from places as far as [[Dendermonde]] and [[Tournai]].  At that time, like in the rest of Flanders, most of the population consisted of farmers, spinners and weavers.  Tax documents from the 13th century attest to the strong economic activity of the time.  Waregem's attempt in 1635 at obtaining rights to hold its own market was opposed by the neighbouring towns.  A Saturday market was finally approved by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] in 1784.\n\n===From the 18th century until today===\nMuch of the medieval land ownership structure remained unchanged until the end of the 18th century, when the town counted some 4,500 inhabitants. The construction of the main roadway between Kortrijk and Ghent made possible the building of an important coaching inn on the territory of Waregem, where horses could be hired. The [[French Revolution]] brought severe religious restrictions in its wake; it also gave the region a modern administrative system and more political autonomy. During the 19th century, the old textile economy went into decline. The proximity of the Leie River, however, was a boon for Waregem, as its [[flax]] industry drove the local economy until well into the 20th century. Waregem earned its official city title on January 1, 2000.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[Image:Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial.jpg|thumb|Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial]]\n\n*The [[Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial]] is the smallest [[World War I]] American cemetery in Europe and the only one in Belgium.

For example, an [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction using the conventional two-operand form ''a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'' can now use a non-destructive three-operand form ''c&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'', preserving both source operands. AVX's three-operand format is limited to the instructions with SIMD operands (YMM), and does not include instructions with general purpose registers (e.g. EAX). Such support will first appear in AVX2.<ref name=\"avx2\"/>\n\nThe [[Data structure alignment|alignment]] requirement of SIMD memory operands is relaxed.<ref name=\"intel_vol1\">{{cite book|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture|publisher=Intel Corporation|page=349|edition=-051US|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-1-manual.pdf|accessdate=August 23, 2014|chapter=14.9|quote=Memory arguments for most instructions with VEX prefix operate normally without causing #GP(0) on any byte-granularity alignment (unlike Legacy SSE instructions).}}</ref>\n\nThe new [[VEX coding scheme]] introduces a new set of code prefixes that extends the [[opcode]] space, allows instructions to have more than two operands, and allows SIMD vector registers to be longer than 128 bits. The VEX prefix can also be used on the legacy SSE instructions giving them a three-operand form, and making them interact more efficiently with AVX instructions without the need for VZEROUPPER and VZEROALL.\n\nThe AVX instructions support both 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD. The 128-bit versions can be useful to improve old code without needing to widen the vectorization, and avoid the penalty of going from SSE to AVX, they are also faster on some early AMD implementations of AVX. This mode is sometimes known as AVX-128.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html#i386-and-x86-64-Options|title=i386 and x86-64 Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== New instructions ===\nThese AVX instructions are in addition to the ones that are 256-bit extensions of the legacy 128-bit SSE instructions; most are usable on both 128-bit and 256-bit operands.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, an [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction using the conventional two-operand form ''a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'' can now use a non-destructive three-operand form ''c&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'', preserving both source operands. AVX's three-operand format is limited to the instructions with SIMD operands (YMM), and does not include instructions with general purpose registers (e.g. EAX). Such support will first appear in AVX2.<ref name=\"avx2\"/>\n\nThe [[Data structure alignment|alignment]] requirement of SIMD memory operands is relaxed.<ref name=\"intel_vol1\">{{cite book|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture|publisher=Intel Corporation|page=349|edition=-051US|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-1-manual.pdf|accessdate=August 23, 2014|chapter=14.9|quote=Memory arguments for most instructions with VEX prefix operate normally without causing #GP(0) on any byte-granularity alignment (unlike Legacy SSE instructions).}}</ref>\n\nThe new [[VEX coding scheme]] introduces a new set of code prefixes that extends the [[opcode]] space, allows instructions to have more than two operands, and allows SIMD vector registers to be longer than 128 bits. The VEX prefix can also be used on the legacy SSE instructions giving them a three-operand form, and making them interact more efficiently with AVX instructions without the need for VZEROUPPER and VZEROALL.\n\nThe AVX instructions support both 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD. The 128-bit versions can be useful to improve old code without needing to widen the vectorization, and avoid the penalty of going from SSE to AVX, they are also faster on some early AMD implementations of AVX. This mode is sometimes known as AVX-128.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html#i386-and-x86-64-Options|title=i386 and x86-64 Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== New instructions ===\nThese AVX instructions are in addition to the ones that are 256-bit extensions of the legacy 128-bit SSE instructions; most are usable on both 128-bit and 256-bit operands.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The other half of the destination is unchanged.\n|-\n| <code>VEXTRACTF128</code>\n| Extracts either the lower half or the upper half of a 256-bit YMM register and copies the value to a 128-bit destination operand.\n|-\n| <code>VMASKMOVPS</code>, <code>VMASKMOVPD</code>\n| Conditionally reads any number of elements from a SIMD vector memory operand into a destination register, leaving the remaining vector elements unread and setting the corresponding elements in the destination register to zero. Alternatively, conditionally writes any number of elements from a SIMD vector register operand to a vector memory operand, leaving the remaining elements of the memory operand unchanged. On the AMD Jaguar processor architecture, this instruction with a memory source operand takes more than 300 clock cycles when the mask is zero, in which case the instruction should do nothing. This appears to be a design flaw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf |title=The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs: An optimization guide for assembly programmers and compiler makers |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| <code>VPERMILPS</code>, <code>VPERMILPD</code>\n| Permute In-Lane.

Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy [[balloon]]s to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry numerous [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[strike aircraft]], [[military helicopter|helicopters]], and other types of aircraft. While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing [[gunship]]s and [[bomber]]s have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them. By its diplomatic and tactical power, its mobility, its autonomy and the variety of its means, the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets. Tactically or even strategically, it replaced the [[battleship]] in the role of flagship of a fleet. One of its great advantages is that, by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries, reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone.\n\n[[File:World Navy Aircraft carries chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Chart comparing a range of aircraft carriers, from longest (top left) to shortest]]\nThere is no single definition of an \"aircraft carrier\",<ref name=\"gscarrier\">{{Citation|title=Military|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|contribution=World Wide Aircraft Carriers|access-date=8 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206024907/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|archive-date=6 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and modern navies use several variants of the type.

The United Kingdom and China each operate two aircraft carriers. France, India, and Russia each operate a single medium-size carrier with a capacity of 30 to 60 fighter jets. Italy operates two light fleet carriers and Spain operates one. [[Helicopter carriers]] are operated by Japan (4), France (3), Australia (2), Egypt (2), Brazil (1), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1). Future aircraft carriers are under construction or in planning by Brazil, China, India, Russia and the US.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Types of carrier==\n[[File:US Navy 060427-N-5961C-009 USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76),FS Charles De Gaulle (R-92),FS Cassard (D-614), guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG 69), USS McCampbell (DDG 85) conduct joint operations in the Persian Gulf.jpg|thumb|French aircraft carrier {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}} (rear), and U.S. Navy carrier {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6}}, conducting joint operations in the Persian Gulf, both of which have the [[CATOBAR]] configuration.]]\n\n=== General features===\n* Speed is an important asset for aircraft carriers, as they need to be deployed anywhere in the world quickly, and must be fast enough to evade detection and targeting by enemy forces. To avoid nuclear submarines, they should be faster than 30 knots.\n* Aircraft carriers are among the largest warships, as they need a lot of deck room.\n* Aircraft carrier must be able to perform an increasingly diverse mission sets. Diplomacy, power projection, quick crisis response force, land attack from the sea, sea base for helicopter and amphibious assault forces, Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Defensive Counter Air (DCA), and Humanitarian Aid Disaster Relief (HADR) are some of the missions the aircraft carrier is expected to accomplish. Traditionally an aircraft carrier is supposed to be one ship that can perform at least power projection and sea control missions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.japcc.org/will-the-aircraft-carrier-survive/ |title = Will the Aircraft Carrier Survive?|date = 13 December 2018}}</ref>\n* Aircraft carrier must be able to efficiently operate an air combat group. This means it should handle fixed-wing jets as well as helicopters. This includes ships designed to support operations of short-takeoff/vertical-landing (STOVL) jets.\n\n===Basic types===\n* [[Amphibious assault ship]]\n* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]\n* [[Balloon carrier]] and balloon tenders\n* [[Escort carrier]]\n* [[Fleet carrier]]\n* [[Flight deck cruiser]]\n* [[Helicopter carrier]]\n* [[Light aircraft carrier]]\n* [[Sea Control Ship]]\n* [[Seaplane tender]] and seaplane carriers\n* [[Aircraft cruiser]]\n<small>''(Note: Some of the types listed here are not strictly defined as aircraft carriers by some sources.)''</small>\n\n===By role===\n[[File:INS Vikramaditya (R33) close shot.jpg|thumb|{{INS|Vikramaditya}} of the [[Indian Navy]] has the [[STOBAR]] configuration.]]\n\nA ''[[fleet carrier]]'' is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, ''[[escort carrier]]s'' were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. ''[[Light aircraft carrier]]s'' were fast enough to operate with the main fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity.\n\nThe Soviet aircraft carrier ''[[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|Admiral Kusnetsov]]'' was termed a ''heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser''. This was primarily a legal construct to avoid the limitations of the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits#Aircraft carriers|Montreux Convention]] preventing 'aircraft carriers' transiting the [[Turkish Straits]] between the Soviet Black Sea bases and the Mediterranean. These ships, while sized in the range of large fleet carriers, were designed to deploy alone or with escorts. In addition to supporting fighter aircraft and helicopters, they provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser.\n\n===By configuration===\nAircraft carriers today are usually divided into the following four categories based on the way that aircraft take off and land:\n* ''Catapult-assisted take-off barrier arrested-recovery'' (''[[CATOBAR]]''): these carriers generally carry the largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). All CATOBAR carriers in service today are nuclear powered. Two nations currently operate carriers of this type: ten ''Nimitz'' class and one ''Gerald R. Ford'' class fleet carriers by the United States, and one medium-sized carrier by France, for a world total of twelve in service.\n* ''Short take-off barrier-arrested recovery'' (''[[STOBAR]]''): these carriers are generally limited to carrying lighter fixed-wing aircraft with more limited payloads. STOBAR carrier air wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-33]] and future [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] wings of {{Ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} are often geared primarily towards air superiority and fleet defense roles rather than strike/power projection tasks,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which require heavier payloads (bombs and air-to-ground missiles). Today China operate two STOBAR carriers and India and Russia each operate one carrier of this type \u2013 a total of four in service currently.\n[[File:Cavour (550) - Civitavecchia harbour, Italy - June 2011.jpg|thumb|right|{{Ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|550|2}}, a [[light aircraft carrier]] of the [[Italian Navy]]]]\n* ''Short take-off vertical-landing'' (''[[STOVL]]''): limited to carrying STOVL aircraft. STOVL aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family and [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] generally have limited payloads, lower performance, and high fuel consumption when compared with conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however, a new generation of STOVL aircraft, currently consisting of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]B, has much improved performance.

There are currently fourteen helicopter carriers (that solely operate helicopters and not fixed-wing aircraft), operated by seven navies, in commission today. Japan has four of this type, France three, Australia two, Egypt two, and South Korea, Thailand, and Brazil have one each. In the past, some conventional carriers were converted and called [[Amphibious assault ship|commando carriers]] by the Royal Navy.

These conversions gave rise to the US {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s (1927), Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, and British {{sclass-|Courageous|aircraft carrier|4}}. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s. This resulted in the commissioning of ships such as the Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H\u014dsh\u014d||2}} (1922),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese-inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html|title=Japanese inventions that changed the world|website=CNN|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103173202/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese-inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html|archive-date=3 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> followed by {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} (1924, although laid down before ''H\u014dsh\u014d'' in 1918) and {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} (1927). During [[World War II]], these ships would become known as [[fleet carrier]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{See also|List of aircraft carriers of the Second World War}}\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Navy's [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] in 1939, with Swordfish biplane bombers passing overhead. The British aircraft carrier was involved in the crippling of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CV-6) in Puget Sound, September 1945.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, the [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|most decorated U.S. warship of World War II]]]]\n\nThe aircraft carrier dramatically changed [[naval warfare]] in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had greater range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940, when {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched a long-range [[Battle of Taranto|strike on the Italian fleet]] at their base in [[Taranto]], signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation in the shallow water harbor incapacitated three of the anchored six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers.\n\n[[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|World War II in the Pacific Ocean]] involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The Japanese surprise attack on the American Pacific fleet at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] naval and air bases on Sunday, 7 December 1941, was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. Further versatility was demonstrated during the \"[[Doolittle Raid]]\", on 18 April 1942, when US Navy carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} sailed to within {{convert|650|nmi|km}} of Japan and launched 16 [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] from her deck in a retaliatory strike on the mainland, including the capital, [[Tokyo]]. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of {{HMS|Glorious}} by German battleships during the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian campaign in 1940]].\n\nThis new-found importance of [[naval aviation]] forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage led to the development and construction of 'light' carriers. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were sometimes purpose-built but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, [[light aircraft carrier]]s built by the U.S., such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more \"militarized\" version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]] was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robbins |first=Guy |title=The Aircraft Carrier Story: 1908\u20131945 |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Cassel |page=[https://archive.org/details/aircraftcarriers0000robb/page/91 91] |isbn=978-0-30435-308-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/aircraftcarriers0000robb/page/91 }}</ref> They served the Royal Navy during the war, and the hull design was chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war, until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range land-based German aircraft.\n\n===Postwar era===\n[[File:Arromanches (R95) with Hellcat landing c1953.jpg|alt=|thumb|An [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F-5]] landing on the French ''[[French aircraft carrier Arromanches (R95)|Arromanches]]'' in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], 1953.]]\n[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tripoli'', a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CVN-65).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}, \"The Big E\", the world's first nuclear-powered carrier, commissioned in 1961]]\n\nBefore World War II, international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]], and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers. Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of U.S.N. carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II\u2013era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same\u2014a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of individual military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that some nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, social and military impact if a carrier is lost, or is even sent to a potential crisis zone or used in conflict.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nSome changes were made after 1945 in carriers:\n* The '''angled flight deck''' was invented by [[Royal Navy]] Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Dennis Cambell]], as naval aviation jets higher speeds required carriers be modified to \"fit\" their needs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denniscambell.org.uk/4663/4690.html |title=The Angled Deck Story |work=denniscambell.org.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=9 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070012/http://www.denniscambell.org.uk/4663/4690.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/fleet-air-arm-oa-history |title=History of Fleet Air Arm Officers Association |work=FAAOA.org |year=2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Innovation in Carrier Aviation |first1=Thomas C. |last1=Hone |first2=Norman |last2=Friedman |first3=Mark D. |last3=Mandeles |journal=Newport Paper 37 |publisher=Naval War College Press |year=2011}}; abridged findings published as {{cite journal |title=The Development of the Angled-Deck Aircraft Carrier |journal=Naval War College Review |date=Spring 2011 |volume=64 |number=2 |pages=63\u201378}}</ref> Additionally, the angled flight deck allows for simultaneous launch and recovery. \n* Aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate continuous increase in aircraft size. The 1950s saw U.S. Navy's commission of \"supercarriers\", designed to operate naval jets, which offered better performance at the expense of bigger size and demanded more ordnance to be carried on-board (fuel, spare parts, electronics, etc.).\n* Increase in size and requirements of being capable of more than 30 knots and to be at sea for long periods meant nuclear reactors are now used by aboard aircraft carriers to generate the steam used to produce power for propulsion, electric power, catapulting airplanes in aircraft carriers, and a few more minor uses.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-powered-ships.aspx | title=Nuclear-Powered Ships &#124; Nuclear Submarines - World Nuclear Association}}</ref>\n\nModern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously held by the sailing galleons, frigates and ships-of-the-line and later steam or diesel powered [[battleship]]. This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance, and along with, carrier designs also increased in size and ability. Some of these larger carriers, dubbed by the media as \"supercarriers\", displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as the {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|5}} and {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|5}} classes, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as \"commando carriers\"<ref>A number of British conversions of light fleet carriers to helicopter operations were known as commando carriers, though they did not operate landing craft</ref> or \"helicopter carriers\", many have the capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.\n\nLacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, an aircraft carrier is generally accompanied by a number of other ships to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies and perform other support services, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. The resulting group of ships is often termed a battle group, carrier group, [[carrier battle group]] or [[carrier strike group]].\n\nThere is a view among some military pundits that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, or even ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads have made aircraft carriers and carrier groups obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-05/twilight-uperfluous-carrier |first1=Henry J. |last1=Hendrix |first2=J.

Roosevelt|CV-42|6}}]]\n\nCarriers are large and long ships, although there is a high degree of variation depending on their intended role and [[air wing|aircraft complement]]. The size of the carrier has varied over history and among [[navy|navies]], to cater to the various roles that global climates have demanded from [[naval aviation]].\n\nRegardless of size, the ship itself must house their complement of aircraft, with space for launching, storing, and maintaining them. Space is also required for the large crew, supplies (food, munitions, fuel, engineering parts), and propulsion. US aircraft carriers are notable for having [[nuclear reactor]]s powering their systems and propulsion. This makes the carrier reasonably tall.\n\nThe top of the carrier is the flight deck, where aircraft are launched and recovered. On the starboard side of this is the island, where the [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]], air-traffic control and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] are located.\n\nThe constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly, as they influence the weight, type, and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched. For example, assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft, especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons. CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN fleet carriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full load-outs, especially on ground-attack missions. STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for [[fighter aircraft]].\n\n[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68|6}} in 1945]]\nDue to the busy nature of the flight deck, only 20 or so aircraft may be on it at any one time. A hangar storage several decks below the flight deck is where most aircraft are kept, and aircraft are taken from the lower storage decks to the flight deck through the use of an elevator. The hangar is usually quite large and can take up several decks of vertical space.<ref>How Aircraft Carriers Work, ''How Stuff Works'', by Tom Harris \u2013 http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006205343/http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm |date=6 October 2013}} Accessed 5 October 2013</ref>\n\nMunitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive. Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency.\n\n===Flight deck===\n{{Main|Flight deck}}\n[[File:US Navy 081124-N-3659B-305 F-A-18C Hornets launch from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft catapult|Catapult]] launches aboard {{USS|Ronald Reagan}}]]\n[[File:Vikramaditya 5.jpg|thumb|Expansive flight deck of {{INS|Vikramaditya}} at night showing the [[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump ramp]] used for [[STOBAR]] configuration]]\n\nAs \"runways at sea\", aircraft carriers have a flat-top [[flight deck]], which [[Takeoff|launches]] and [[landing|recovers]] aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier. For example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft [[accelerate]] more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.\n\nThere are two main philosophies in order to keep the deck short: add thrust to the aircraft, such as using a Catapult Assisted Take-Off (CATO-); and changing the direction of the airplanes' thrust, as in Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own:\n* [[CATOBAR|Catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery]] (CATOBAR): A steam- or electric-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is connected to the aircraft, and is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed. By the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. This is the most expensive method as it requires complex machinery to be installed under the flight deck, but allows for even heavily loaded aircraft to take off.\n* [[STOBAR|Short take-off but arrested recovery]] (STOBAR) depends on increasing the net lift on the aircraft. Aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off; instead on nearly all ships of this type an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck, often combined with thrust vectoring by the aircraft. Alternatively, by reducing the fuel and weapon load, an aircraft is able to reach faster speeds and generate more upwards lift and launch without a ski-jump or catapult.\n* [[STOVL|Short take-off vertical-landing]] (STOVL): On aircraft carriers, non-catapult-assisted, fixed-wing short takeoffs are accomplished with the use of [[thrust vectoring]], which may also be used in conjunction with a runway \"[[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump]]\". Use of STOVL tends to allow aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while still only requiring a short runway. The most famous examples are the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] and the [[Sea Harrier]]. Although technically VTOL aircraft, they are operationally STOVL aircraft due to the extra weight carried at take-off for fuel and armaments. The same is true of the [[F-35B Lightning II]], which demonstrated VTOL capability in test flights but is operationally STOVL.\n* [[VTOL|Vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL): Aircraft are specifically designed for the purpose of using very high degrees of thrust vectoring (e.g. if the thrust to weight-force ratio is greater than 1, it can take off vertically), but are usually slower than conventionally propelled aircraft.\n\nOn the recovery side of the flight deck, the adaptation to the aircraft load-out is mirrored. Non-VTOL or conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATO''BAR'' or STO''BAR'') to recover their aircraft. Aircraft that are landing extend a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance. Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to \"bolt\" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.\n\nIf the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area. [[Helicopter]]s and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ([[V/STOL]]) usually recover by coming abreast of the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.\n\n====Staff and deck operations====\n[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|left|F/A-18 Hornet aircraft landing video]]\n\nCarriers steam at speed, up to {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}} into the wind during flight deck operations to increase wind speed over the deck to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.\n\nSince the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two \"waist\" catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves [[launch and recovery cycle]] flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.\n\nConventional (\"tailhook\") aircraft rely upon a [[Landing Signal Officer|landing signal officer]] (LSO, radio call sign ''paddles'') to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as the [[optical landing system]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.\n\n[[File:USS John C. Stennis flight operations 121229-N-OY799-239.jpg|thumb|{{USS|John C. Stennis}} shooter launching F/A-18]]\nKey personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters, the handler, and the air boss. Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[naval flight officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The \"air boss\" (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called ''primary'' or ''the tower'') and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and \"those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=30 January 2009 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |archivedate= 21 February 2009}}</ref> The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.\n\nTo facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]]. Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.\n\n====Deck structures====\n[[File:US Navy 100512-N-8446A-004 An F-A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the Fighting Checkmates of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 211 lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65).jpg|thumb|Island control structure of {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}]]\n[[File:FS CDG bridge3.jpg|alt=|thumb|The command bridge of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle||2}}]]\n\nThe superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated in a relatively small area called an ''island'', a feature pioneered on {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} in 1923. While the island is usually built on the [[starboard]] side of the flight deck, the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} had their islands built on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The ''flush deck'' configuration proved to have significant drawbacks, primary of which was management of the exhaust from the power plant. Fumes coming across the deck were a major issue in {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}. In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|pp=241\u2013243}}\n\nAnother deck structure that can be seen is a [[ski-jump ramp]] at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[STOVL]] aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump, launching fully-loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]] or crashing directly into the sea.\n\n[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}]]\nAlthough STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment. Vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.\n\nThe disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket. For example, the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} with a minimal armament and fuel load. Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present, such as on a US [[landing helicopter dock]] or [[landing helicopter assault]] amphibious assault ship.  A ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas; this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.\n\n==National fleets==\n{{See also|List of aircraft carriers by country|List of aircraft carriers in service}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy has the largest carriers in the world, and currently has eleven in service. The UK has two 65,000-tonne STOVL carriers in active service. China has two STOBAR carriers in service. The navies of France, India, and Russia each operate a single medium-sized fleet carrier. The US has nine similarly sized Amphibious Warfare Ships. There are three small light carriers in use capable of operating both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, Italy operates two, and Spain one.\n\nAdditionally there are fourteen small carriers which only operate helicopters serving the navies of Australia (2), Brazil (1), Egypt (2), France (3), Japan (4), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1).\n\n===Australia===\n====Current====\n[[File:HMAS Canberra (LHD 02) at berth prior to commissioning.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|L02|6}}, a {{sclass-|Canberra|landing helicopter dock|1}}]]\n\nThe [[Royal Australian Navy]] operates two {{sclass-|Canberra|landing helicopter dock|1}}s.

Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy [[balloon]]s to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry numerous [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[strike aircraft]], [[military helicopter|helicopters]], and other types of aircraft. While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing [[gunship]]s and [[bomber]]s have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them. By its diplomatic and tactical power, its mobility, its autonomy and the variety of its means, the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets. Tactically or even strategically, it replaced the [[battleship]] in the role of flagship of a fleet. One of its great advantages is that, by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries, reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone.\n\n[[File:World Navy Aircraft carries chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Chart comparing a range of aircraft carriers, from longest (top left) to shortest]]\nThere is no single definition of an \"aircraft carrier\",<ref name=\"gscarrier\">{{Citation|title=Military|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|contribution=World Wide Aircraft Carriers|access-date=8 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206024907/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|archive-date=6 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and modern navies use several variants of the type.

The United Kingdom and China each operate two aircraft carriers. France, India, and Russia each operate a single medium-size carrier with a capacity of 30 to 60 fighter jets. Italy operates two light fleet carriers and Spain operates one. [[Helicopter carriers]] are operated by Japan (4), France (3), Australia (2), Egypt (2), Brazil (1), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1). Future aircraft carriers are under construction or in planning by Brazil, China, India, Russia and the US.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Types of carrier==\n[[File:US Navy 060427-N-5961C-009 USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76),FS Charles De Gaulle (R-92),FS Cassard (D-614), guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG 69), USS McCampbell (DDG 85) conduct joint operations in the Persian Gulf.jpg|thumb|French aircraft carrier {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}} (rear), and U.S. Navy carrier {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6}}, conducting joint operations in the Persian Gulf, both of which have the [[CATOBAR]] configuration.]]\n\n=== General features===\n* Speed is an important asset for aircraft carriers, as they need to be deployed anywhere in the world quickly, and must be fast enough to evade detection and targeting by enemy forces. To avoid nuclear submarines, they should be faster than 30 knots.\n* Aircraft carriers are among the largest warships, as they need a lot of deck room.\n* Aircraft carrier must be able to perform an increasingly diverse mission sets. Diplomacy, power projection, quick crisis response force, land attack from the sea, sea base for helicopter and amphibious assault forces, Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Defensive Counter Air (DCA), and Humanitarian Aid Disaster Relief (HADR) are some of the missions the aircraft carrier is expected to accomplish. Traditionally an aircraft carrier is supposed to be one ship that can perform at least power projection and sea control missions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.japcc.org/will-the-aircraft-carrier-survive/ |title = Will the Aircraft Carrier Survive?|date = 13 December 2018}}</ref>\n* Aircraft carrier must be able to efficiently operate an air combat group. This means it should handle fixed-wing jets as well as helicopters. This includes ships designed to support operations of short-takeoff/vertical-landing (STOVL) jets.\n\n===Basic types===\n* [[Amphibious assault ship]]\n* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]\n* [[Balloon carrier]] and balloon tenders\n* [[Escort carrier]]\n* [[Fleet carrier]]\n* [[Flight deck cruiser]]\n* [[Helicopter carrier]]\n* [[Light aircraft carrier]]\n* [[Sea Control Ship]]\n* [[Seaplane tender]] and seaplane carriers\n* [[Aircraft cruiser]]\n<small>''(Note: Some of the types listed here are not strictly defined as aircraft carriers by some sources.)''</small>\n\n===By role===\n[[File:INS Vikramaditya (R33) close shot.jpg|thumb|{{INS|Vikramaditya}} of the [[Indian Navy]] has the [[STOBAR]] configuration.]]\n\nA ''[[fleet carrier]]'' is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, ''[[escort carrier]]s'' were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. ''[[Light aircraft carrier]]s'' were fast enough to operate with the main fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity.\n\nThe Soviet aircraft carrier ''[[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|Admiral Kusnetsov]]'' was termed a ''heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser''. This was primarily a legal construct to avoid the limitations of the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits#Aircraft carriers|Montreux Convention]] preventing 'aircraft carriers' transiting the [[Turkish Straits]] between the Soviet Black Sea bases and the Mediterranean. These ships, while sized in the range of large fleet carriers, were designed to deploy alone or with escorts. In addition to supporting fighter aircraft and helicopters, they provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser.\n\n===By configuration===\nAircraft carriers today are usually divided into the following four categories based on the way that aircraft take off and land:\n* ''Catapult-assisted take-off barrier arrested-recovery'' (''[[CATOBAR]]''): these carriers generally carry the largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). All CATOBAR carriers in service today are nuclear powered. Two nations currently operate carriers of this type: ten ''Nimitz'' class and one ''Gerald R. Ford'' class fleet carriers by the United States, and one medium-sized carrier by France, for a world total of twelve in service.\n* ''Short take-off barrier-arrested recovery'' (''[[STOBAR]]''): these carriers are generally limited to carrying lighter fixed-wing aircraft with more limited payloads. STOBAR carrier air wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-33]] and future [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] wings of {{Ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} are often geared primarily towards air superiority and fleet defense roles rather than strike/power projection tasks,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which require heavier payloads (bombs and air-to-ground missiles). Today China operate two STOBAR carriers and India and Russia each operate one carrier of this type \u2013 a total of four in service currently.\n[[File:Cavour (550) - Civitavecchia harbour, Italy - June 2011.jpg|thumb|right|{{Ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|550|2}}, a [[light aircraft carrier]] of the [[Italian Navy]]]]\n* ''Short take-off vertical-landing'' (''[[STOVL]]''): limited to carrying STOVL aircraft. STOVL aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family and [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] generally have limited payloads, lower performance, and high fuel consumption when compared with conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however, a new generation of STOVL aircraft, currently consisting of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]B, has much improved performance. The US has nine STOVL amphibious assault ships. The UK has a class of two 65,000-tonne<ref name=\"HMSQE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/surface-fleet/aircraft-carriers/hms-queen-elizabeth|title=HMS ''Queen Elizabeth''|publisher=royalnavy.mod.uk|accessdate=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093058/https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/surface-fleet/aircraft-carriers/hms-queen-elizabeth|archive-date=13 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> STOVL aircraft carriers, [[List of aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'' and HMS ''Prince of Wales'']], the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy; with one in service and the other being fitted out.

There are currently fourteen helicopter carriers (that solely operate helicopters and not fixed-wing aircraft), operated by seven navies, in commission today. Japan has four of this type, France three, Australia two, Egypt two, and South Korea, Thailand, and Brazil have one each. In the past, some conventional carriers were converted and called [[Amphibious assault ship|commando carriers]] by the Royal Navy. Some helicopter carriers, but not all, are classified as [[amphibious assault ships]], tasked with landing and supporting ground forces on enemy territory.\n\n===By size===\n* [[Fleet carrier]]\n* [[Light aircraft carrier]]\n* [[Escort carrier]]\n\n===Supercarrier===\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano.jpg|thumb|right|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']] was the biggest carrier in World War II, and the largest ship destroyed by a submarine.<ref>Enright & Ryan, p. xiv</ref>]]\n{{other uses|super carrier (disambiguation)}}\n\nThe appellation \"supercarrier\" is not an official designation with any national navy, but a term used predominantly by the media and typically when reporting on new and upcoming aircraft carrier types.

These conversions gave rise to the US {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s (1927), Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, and British {{sclass-|Courageous|aircraft carrier|4}}. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s. This resulted in the commissioning of ships such as the Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H\u014dsh\u014d||2}} (1922),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese-inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html|title=Japanese inventions that changed the world|website=CNN|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103173202/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese-inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html|archive-date=3 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> followed by {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} (1924, although laid down before ''H\u014dsh\u014d'' in 1918) and {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} (1927). During [[World War II]], these ships would become known as [[fleet carrier]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{See also|List of aircraft carriers of the Second World War}}\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Navy's [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] in 1939, with Swordfish biplane bombers passing overhead. The British aircraft carrier was involved in the crippling of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CV-6) in Puget Sound, September 1945.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, the [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|most decorated U.S. warship of World War II]]]]\n\nThe aircraft carrier dramatically changed [[naval warfare]] in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had greater range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940, when {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched a long-range [[Battle of Taranto|strike on the Italian fleet]] at their base in [[Taranto]], signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation in the shallow water harbor incapacitated three of the anchored six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers.\n\n[[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|World War II in the Pacific Ocean]] involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The Japanese surprise attack on the American Pacific fleet at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] naval and air bases on Sunday, 7 December 1941, was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. Further versatility was demonstrated during the \"[[Doolittle Raid]]\", on 18 April 1942, when US Navy carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} sailed to within {{convert|650|nmi|km}} of Japan and launched 16 [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] from her deck in a retaliatory strike on the mainland, including the capital, [[Tokyo]]. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of {{HMS|Glorious}} by German battleships during the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian campaign in 1940]].\n\nThis new-found importance of [[naval aviation]] forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage led to the development and construction of 'light' carriers. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were sometimes purpose-built but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, [[light aircraft carrier]]s built by the U.S., such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more \"militarized\" version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]] was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robbins |first=Guy |title=The Aircraft Carrier Story: 1908\u20131945 |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Cassel |page=[https://archive.org/details/aircraftcarriers0000robb/page/91 91] |isbn=978-0-30435-308-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/aircraftcarriers0000robb/page/91 }}</ref> They served the Royal Navy during the war, and the hull design was chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war, until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range land-based German aircraft.\n\n===Postwar era===\n[[File:Arromanches (R95) with Hellcat landing c1953.jpg|alt=|thumb|An [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F-5]] landing on the French ''[[French aircraft carrier Arromanches (R95)|Arromanches]]'' in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], 1953.]]\n[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tripoli'', a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CVN-65).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}, \"The Big E\", the world's first nuclear-powered carrier, commissioned in 1961]]\n\nBefore World War II, international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]], and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers. Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of U.S.N. carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II\u2013era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same\u2014a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of individual military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that some nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, social and military impact if a carrier is lost, or is even sent to a potential crisis zone or used in conflict.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nSome changes were made after 1945 in carriers:\n* The '''angled flight deck''' was invented by [[Royal Navy]] Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Dennis Cambell]], as naval aviation jets higher speeds required carriers be modified to \"fit\" their needs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denniscambell.org.uk/4663/4690.html |title=The Angled Deck Story |work=denniscambell.org.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=9 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070012/http://www.denniscambell.org.uk/4663/4690.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/fleet-air-arm-oa-history |title=History of Fleet Air Arm Officers Association |work=FAAOA.org |year=2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Innovation in Carrier Aviation |first1=Thomas C. |last1=Hone |first2=Norman |last2=Friedman |first3=Mark D. |last3=Mandeles |journal=Newport Paper 37 |publisher=Naval War College Press |year=2011}}; abridged findings published as {{cite journal |title=The Development of the Angled-Deck Aircraft Carrier |journal=Naval War College Review |date=Spring 2011 |volume=64 |number=2 |pages=63\u201378}}</ref> Additionally, the angled flight deck allows for simultaneous launch and recovery. \n* Aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate continuous increase in aircraft size. The 1950s saw U.S. Navy's commission of \"supercarriers\", designed to operate naval jets, which offered better performance at the expense of bigger size and demanded more ordnance to be carried on-board (fuel, spare parts, electronics, etc.).\n* Increase in size and requirements of being capable of more than 30 knots and to be at sea for long periods meant nuclear reactors are now used by aboard aircraft carriers to generate the steam used to produce power for propulsion, electric power, catapulting airplanes in aircraft carriers, and a few more minor uses.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-powered-ships.aspx | title=Nuclear-Powered Ships &#124; Nuclear Submarines - World Nuclear Association}}</ref>\n\nModern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously held by the sailing galleons, frigates and ships-of-the-line and later steam or diesel powered [[battleship]]. This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance, and along with, carrier designs also increased in size and ability. Some of these larger carriers, dubbed by the media as \"supercarriers\", displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as the {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|5}} and {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|5}} classes, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as \"commando carriers\"<ref>A number of British conversions of light fleet carriers to helicopter operations were known as commando carriers, though they did not operate landing craft</ref> or \"helicopter carriers\", many have the capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.\n\nLacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, an aircraft carrier is generally accompanied by a number of other ships to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies and perform other support services, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. The resulting group of ships is often termed a battle group, carrier group, [[carrier battle group]] or [[carrier strike group]].\n\nThere is a view among some military pundits that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, or even ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads have made aircraft carriers and carrier groups obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-05/twilight-uperfluous-carrier |first1=Henry J. |last1=Hendrix |first2=J.

Roosevelt|CV-42|6}}]]\n\nCarriers are large and long ships, although there is a high degree of variation depending on their intended role and [[air wing|aircraft complement]]. The size of the carrier has varied over history and among [[navy|navies]], to cater to the various roles that global climates have demanded from [[naval aviation]].\n\nRegardless of size, the ship itself must house their complement of aircraft, with space for launching, storing, and maintaining them. Space is also required for the large crew, supplies (food, munitions, fuel, engineering parts), and propulsion. US aircraft carriers are notable for having [[nuclear reactor]]s powering their systems and propulsion. This makes the carrier reasonably tall.\n\nThe top of the carrier is the flight deck, where aircraft are launched and recovered. On the starboard side of this is the island, where the [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]], air-traffic control and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] are located.\n\nThe constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly, as they influence the weight, type, and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched. For example, assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft, especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons. CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN fleet carriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full load-outs, especially on ground-attack missions. STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for [[fighter aircraft]].\n\n[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68|6}} in 1945]]\nDue to the busy nature of the flight deck, only 20 or so aircraft may be on it at any one time. A hangar storage several decks below the flight deck is where most aircraft are kept, and aircraft are taken from the lower storage decks to the flight deck through the use of an elevator. The hangar is usually quite large and can take up several decks of vertical space.<ref>How Aircraft Carriers Work, ''How Stuff Works'', by Tom Harris \u2013 http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006205343/http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm |date=6 October 2013}} Accessed 5 October 2013</ref>\n\nMunitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive. Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency.\n\n===Flight deck===\n{{Main|Flight deck}}\n[[File:US Navy 081124-N-3659B-305 F-A-18C Hornets launch from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft catapult|Catapult]] launches aboard {{USS|Ronald Reagan}}]]\n[[File:Vikramaditya 5.jpg|thumb|Expansive flight deck of {{INS|Vikramaditya}} at night showing the [[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump ramp]] used for [[STOBAR]] configuration]]\n\nAs \"runways at sea\", aircraft carriers have a flat-top [[flight deck]], which [[Takeoff|launches]] and [[landing|recovers]] aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier. For example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft [[accelerate]] more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.\n\nThere are two main philosophies in order to keep the deck short: add thrust to the aircraft, such as using a Catapult Assisted Take-Off (CATO-); and changing the direction of the airplanes' thrust, as in Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own:\n* [[CATOBAR|Catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery]] (CATOBAR): A steam- or electric-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is connected to the aircraft, and is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed. By the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. This is the most expensive method as it requires complex machinery to be installed under the flight deck, but allows for even heavily loaded aircraft to take off.\n* [[STOBAR|Short take-off but arrested recovery]] (STOBAR) depends on increasing the net lift on the aircraft. Aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off; instead on nearly all ships of this type an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck, often combined with thrust vectoring by the aircraft. Alternatively, by reducing the fuel and weapon load, an aircraft is able to reach faster speeds and generate more upwards lift and launch without a ski-jump or catapult.\n* [[STOVL|Short take-off vertical-landing]] (STOVL): On aircraft carriers, non-catapult-assisted, fixed-wing short takeoffs are accomplished with the use of [[thrust vectoring]], which may also be used in conjunction with a runway \"[[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump]]\". Use of STOVL tends to allow aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while still only requiring a short runway. The most famous examples are the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] and the [[Sea Harrier]]. Although technically VTOL aircraft, they are operationally STOVL aircraft due to the extra weight carried at take-off for fuel and armaments. The same is true of the [[F-35B Lightning II]], which demonstrated VTOL capability in test flights but is operationally STOVL.\n* [[VTOL|Vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL): Aircraft are specifically designed for the purpose of using very high degrees of thrust vectoring (e.g. if the thrust to weight-force ratio is greater than 1, it can take off vertically), but are usually slower than conventionally propelled aircraft.\n\nOn the recovery side of the flight deck, the adaptation to the aircraft load-out is mirrored. Non-VTOL or conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATO''BAR'' or STO''BAR'') to recover their aircraft. Aircraft that are landing extend a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance. Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to \"bolt\" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.\n\nIf the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area. [[Helicopter]]s and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ([[V/STOL]]) usually recover by coming abreast of the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.\n\n====Staff and deck operations====\n[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|left|F/A-18 Hornet aircraft landing video]]\n\nCarriers steam at speed, up to {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}} into the wind during flight deck operations to increase wind speed over the deck to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.\n\nSince the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two \"waist\" catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves [[launch and recovery cycle]] flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.\n\nConventional (\"tailhook\") aircraft rely upon a [[Landing Signal Officer|landing signal officer]] (LSO, radio call sign ''paddles'') to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as the [[optical landing system]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.\n\n[[File:USS John C. Stennis flight operations 121229-N-OY799-239.jpg|thumb|{{USS|John C. Stennis}} shooter launching F/A-18]]\nKey personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters, the handler, and the air boss. Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[naval flight officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The \"air boss\" (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called ''primary'' or ''the tower'') and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and \"those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=30 January 2009 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |archivedate= 21 February 2009}}</ref> The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.\n\nTo facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]]. Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.\n\n====Deck structures====\n[[File:US Navy 100512-N-8446A-004 An F-A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the Fighting Checkmates of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 211 lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65).jpg|thumb|Island control structure of {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}]]\n[[File:FS CDG bridge3.jpg|alt=|thumb|The command bridge of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle||2}}]]\n\nThe superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated in a relatively small area called an ''island'', a feature pioneered on {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} in 1923. While the island is usually built on the [[starboard]] side of the flight deck, the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} had their islands built on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The ''flush deck'' configuration proved to have significant drawbacks, primary of which was management of the exhaust from the power plant. Fumes coming across the deck were a major issue in {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}. In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|pp=241\u2013243}}\n\nAnother deck structure that can be seen is a [[ski-jump ramp]] at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[STOVL]] aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump, launching fully-loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]] or crashing directly into the sea.\n\n[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}]]\nAlthough STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment. Vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.\n\nThe disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket. For example, the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} with a minimal armament and fuel load. Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present, such as on a US [[landing helicopter dock]] or [[landing helicopter assault]] amphibious assault ship.  A ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas; this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.\n\n==National fleets==\n{{See also|List of aircraft carriers by country|List of aircraft carriers in service}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy has the largest carriers in the world, and currently has eleven in service. The UK has two 65,000-tonne STOVL carriers in active service. China has two STOBAR carriers in service. The navies of France, India, and Russia each operate a single medium-sized fleet carrier. The US has nine similarly sized Amphibious Warfare Ships. There are three small light carriers in use capable of operating both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, Italy operates two, and Spain one.\n\nAdditionally there are fourteen small carriers which only operate helicopters serving the navies of Australia (2), Brazil (1), Egypt (2), France (3), Japan (4), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1).\n\n===Australia===\n====Current====\n[[File:HMAS Canberra (LHD 02) at berth prior to commissioning.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|L02|6}}, a {{sclass-|Canberra|landing helicopter dock|1}}]]\n\nThe [[Royal Australian Navy]] operates two {{sclass-|Canberra|landing helicopter dock|1}}s.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.
