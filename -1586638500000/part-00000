Scores for each shot were in increments of 1, with a maximum score of 10.\n\nThe top 8 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired an additional 10 shots, all from the standing position. These shots scored in increments of .1, with a maximum score of 10.9. The total score from all 70 shots was used to determine final ranking.\n\nRussia's [[Lioubov Galkina]] bounced back from her bitter final-shot defeat in air rifle shooting on the first day to fire an outstanding 101.4 for the gold in the rifle three positions finale, demolishing a new Olympic record score of 689.4.<ref>{{cite news|title=Galkina takes shooting gold|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/shooting/3582978.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 August 2004|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> Italy's [[Valentina Turisini]] took the silver with a score of 685.9, while China's [[Wang Chengyi]] rounded out the podium with a bronze at 685.4.

Even common actions like [[handshake|hand-shaking]] and saying \"[[hello]]\" may be termed as ''rituals''.\n\nThe field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or \"[[Emic and etic|etic]]\" category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. The term can be used also by the insider or \"[[Emic and etic|emic]]\" performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kyriakidis|first=E., ed.|title=The archaeology of ritual.|year=2007|publisher=Cotsen Institute of Archaeology UCLA publications}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Psychology}}\nIn [[psychology]], the term ''ritual'' is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''ritual'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''ritualis,'' \"that which pertains to [[wikt:rite|rite]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus|ritus]]'')\". In Roman [[Roman law|juridical]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]] usage, ''ritus'' was the proven way ''([[mos maiorum|mos]])'' of doing something,<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], entry on ''ritus'', p. 364 (edition of Lindsay).</ref> or \"correct performance, custom\".<ref>Barbara Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" in ''Religion in the Making: The Emergence of the Sciences of Religion'' (Brill, 1998), p. 278.</ref> The original concept of ''ritus'' may be related to the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Rta|\u1e5bt\u00e1]]'' (\"visible order)\" in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], \"the lawful and regular order of the normal, and therefore proper, natural and true structure of cosmic, worldly, human and ritual events\".<ref>Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" p. 278.</ref> The word \"ritual\" is first recorded in English in 1570, and came into use in the 1600s to mean \"the prescribed order of performing religious services\" or more particularly a book of these prescriptions.<ref>Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" p. 278, citing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|actions}}Characteristics ==\n\nThere are hardly any limits to the kind of actions that may be incorporated into a ritual. The rites of past and present societies have typically involved special gestures and words, recitation of fixed texts, performance of special [[music]], [[singing|songs]] or [[dance]]s, processions, manipulation of certain objects, use of special dresses, consumption of special [[food]], [[drink]], or [[entheogen|drugs]], and much more.<ref>(Tolbert 1990a, 1990b; Wilce 2006)</ref>\n\n[[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] argues that rituals can be characterized by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism and performance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=138\u201369}}</ref>\n\n=== Formalism ===\n\n[[File:IteMissaEst.jpg|thumb|The use of Latin in a Tridentine Catholic Mass is an example of a \"restricted code\".]]\n\nRitual utilizes a limited and rigidly organized set of expressions which [[anthropologist]]s call a \"restricted code\" (in opposition to a more open \"elaborated code\"). Maurice Bloch argues that ritual obliges participants to use this formal oratorical style, which is limited in intonation, syntax, vocabulary, loudness, and fixity of order. In adopting this style, ritual leaders' speech becomes more style than content. Because this formal speech limits what can be said, it induces \"acceptance, compliance, or at least forbearance with regard to any overt challenge\". Bloch argues that this form of ritual communication makes rebellion impossible and revolution the only feasible alternative. Ritual tends to support traditional forms of social hierarchy and authority, and maintains the assumptions on which the authority is based from challenge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=139\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Traditionalism===\n[[File:The First Thanksgiving cph.3g04961.jpg|thumb|''The First Thanksgiving 1621'', oil on canvas by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]] (1863\u20131930).

Traditionalism varies from formalism in that the ritual may not be formal yet still makes an appeal to the historical trend. An example is the American Thanksgiving dinner, which may not be formal, yet is ostensibly based on an event from the early Puritan settlement of America. Historians [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Terrence Ranger]] have argued that many of these are ''[[invented traditions]]'', such as the rituals of the British monarchy, which invoke \"thousand year-old tradition\" but whose actual form originate in the late nineteenth century, to some extent reviving earlier forms, in this case medieval, that had been discontinued in the meantime. Thus, the appeal to history is important rather than accurate historical transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=145\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Invariance===\n[[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] states that ritual is also invariant, implying careful choreography. This is less an appeal to traditionalism than a striving for timeless repetition. The key to invariance is bodily discipline, as in monastic prayer and meditation meant to mold dispositions and moods. This bodily discipline is frequently performed in unison, by groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=152\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Rule-governance===\nRituals tend to be governed by rules, a feature somewhat like formalism. Rules impose norms on the chaos of behavior, either defining the outer limits of what is acceptable or choreographing each move. Individuals are held to communally approved customs that evoke a legitimate communal authority that can constrain the possible outcomes. Historically, War in most societies has been bound by highly ritualized constraints that limit the legitimate means by which war was waged.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=155}}</ref>\n\n===Sacrifice===\nActivities appealing to supernatural beings are easily considered rituals, although the appeal may be quite indirect, expressing only a generalized belief in the existence of the sacred demanding a human response.

Rituals may be seasonal, hallowing a culturally defined moment of change in the climatic cycle or the inauguration of an activity such as planting, harvesting, or moving from winter to summer pasture; or they may be contingent, held in response to an individual or collective crisis. Contingent rituals may be further subdivided into life-crisis ceremonies, which are performed at birth, puberty, marriage, death, and so on, to demarcate the passage from one phase to another in the individual's life-cycle, and rituals of affliction, which are performed to placate or exorcise preternatural beings or forces believed to have afflicted villagers with illness, bad luck, gynecological troubles, severe physical injuries, and the like. Other classes of rituals include divinatory rituals; ceremonies performed by political authorities to ensure the health and fertility of human beings, animals, and crops in their territories; initiation into priesthoods devoted to certain deities, into religious associations, or into secret societies; and those accompanying the daily offering of food and libations to deities or ancestral spirits or both.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Symbols in African Ritual (16 March 1973)|journal=Science|volume=179|issue=4078|pages=1100\u20131105|doi=10.1126/science.179.4078.1100|pmid=17788268|year=1973|last1=Turner|first1=V. W.|bibcode=1973Sci...179.1100T}}</ref>|[[Victor Turner]]}}\n\nFor simplicity's sake, the range of diverse rituals can be divided into categories with common characteristics. Rituals can fall in more than one genre.\n\n===Rites of passage===\n{{main|Rites of passage|Initiation}}\n\nA rite of passage is a ritual event that marks a person's transition from one [[social status|status]] to another, including birth, coming-of-age,  marriage, death as well as initiation into groups not tied to a formal stage of life such as a fraternity. Arnold van Gennep stated that rites of passage are marked by three stages: separation, transition and incorporation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=94}}</ref> In the first stage, the initiates are separated from their old identities through physical and symbolic means. In the transition phase, they are \"betwixt and between\". [[Victor Turner]] argued that this stage is marked by [[liminality]], a condition of ambiguity or disorientation in which initiates have been stripped of their old identities, but have not yet acquired their new one. Turner states \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=95}}</ref>  In this stage of liminality or \"anti-structure\" (see below), the initiates' role ambiguity creates a sense of [[communitas]] or emotional bond of community between them. This stage may be marked by ritual ordeals or ritual training. In the final stage of incorporation, the initiates are symbolically confirmed in their new identity and community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}</ref>\n\n===Calendrical and commemorative rites===\nCalendrical and commemorative rites are ritual events marking particular times of year, or a fixed period since an important event. Calendrical rituals give social meaning to the passage of time, creating repetitive weekly, monthly or yearly cycles. Some rites are oriented towards seasonal changes, and may be fixed by the [[Solar calendar|solar]] or [[lunar calendar]]. Those fixed by the solar calendar fall on the same day (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as [[New Year's Day]] on the first of January) while those calculated by the lunar calendar fall on different dates (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as [[Chinese New Year|Chinese lunar New Year]]). Calendrical rites impose a cultural order on nature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=102\u201303}}</ref> Mircea Eliade states that the calendrical rituals of many religious traditions recall and commemorate the basic beliefs of a community, and their yearly celebration establishes a link between past and present, as if the original events are happening over again: \"Thus the gods did; thus men do.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Eliade|first=Mircea|title=The Myth of Eternal Return or, Cosmos and History|year=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=21}}</ref>\n\n===Rites of exchange and communion===\nThis genre of ritual encompasses forms of sacrifice and offering meant to praise, please or placate divine powers. According to early anthropologist Edward Tylor, such sacrifices are [[Gift economy|gifts]] given in hope of a return. [[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]], however, points out that sacrifice covers a range of practices from those that are manipulative and \"magical\" to those of pure devotion. Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]], for example, appear to have no other purpose than to please the deity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=109}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Marcel Mauss]], sacrifice is distinguished from other forms of offering by being consecrated, and hence sanctified. As a consequence, the offering is usually destroyed in the ritual to transfer it to the deities.\n\n===Rites of affliction===\n{{main|Shamanism|Divination}}\nAnthropologist Victor Turner defines rites of affliction actions that seek to mitigate spirits that inflict humans with misfortune. These rites may include forms of spirit [[divination]] (consulting [[oracles]]) to establish causes\u2014and rituals that heal, purify, exorcise, and protect. The misfortune experienced may include individual health, but also broader climate-related issues such as drought or plagues of insects. Healing rites performed by [[shamans]] frequently identify social disorder as the cause, and make the restoration of social relationships the cure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=9ff}}</ref>\n\nTurner uses the example of the Isoma ritual among the Ndembu of northwestern [[Zambia]] to illustrate. The Isoma rite of affliction is used to cure a childless woman of infertility. Infertility is the result of a \"structural tension between [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent and [[Virilocality|virilocal]] marriage\" (i.e., the tension a woman feels between her mother's family, to whom she owes allegiance, and her husband's family among whom she must live). \"It is because the woman has come too closely in touch with the 'man's side' in her marriage that her dead matrikin have impaired her fertility.\" To correct the balance of matrilinial descent and marriage, the Isoma ritual dramatically placates the deceased spirits by requiring the woman to reside with her mother's kin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n[[File:Carnaval Venecia 14feb2009.jpg|thumb|Masquerade at the [[Carnival of Venice]].]]\nShamanic and other ritual may effect a psychotherapeutic cure, leading anthropologists such as Jane Atkinson to theorize how. Atkinson argues that the effectiveness of a shamanic ritual for an individual may depend upon a wider audiences acknowledging the shaman's power, which may lead to the shaman placing greater emphasis on engaging the audience than in the healing of the patient.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Jane|title=The Effectiveness of Shamans in an Indonesian Ritual|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1987|volume=89|issue=2|page=342|doi=10.1525/aa.1987.89.2.02a00040}}</ref>\n\n===Rites of feasting, fasting and festivals===\nRites of feasting and fasting are those through which a community publicly expresses an adherence to basic, shared religious values, rather than to the overt presence of deities as is found in rites of affliction where feasting or fasting may also take place. It encompasses a range of performances such as communal fasting during [[Ramadan]] by Muslims; the [[Moka exchange|slaughter of pigs]] in New Guinea; [[Carnival]] festivities; or penitential processions in Catholicism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=121}}</ref> Victor Turner described this \"cultural performance\" of basic values a \"social drama\". Such dramas allow the social stresses that are inherent in a particular culture to be expressed and worked out symbolically in a ritual catharsis; as the social tensions continue to persist outside the ritual, pressure mounts for the ritual's cyclical performance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society|url=https://archive.org/details/dramasfieldsmeta00turn|url-access=registration|year=1974|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dramasfieldsmeta00turn/page/23 23\u201335]}}</ref> In Carnival, for example, the practice of masking allows people to be what they are not, and acts as a general social leveller, erasing otherwise tense social hierarchies in a festival that emphasizes play outside the bounds of normal social limits. Yet outside carnival, social tensions of race, class and gender persist, hence requiring the repeated periodic release found in the festival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinser|first=Samuel|title=Carnival, American Style; Mardi Gras at New Orleans and Mobile|year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=282}}</ref>\n\n===Political rituals===\nAccording to anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], political rituals actually construct power; that is, in his analysis of the [[Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|Balinese state]], he argued that rituals are not an ornament of political power, but that the power of political actors depends upon their ability to create rituals and the cosmic framework within which the social hierarchy headed by the king is perceived as natural and sacred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|url=https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=[https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1/page/13 13]\u201317, 21}}</ref> As a \"dramaturgy of power\" comprehensive ritual systems may create a cosmological order that [[Sacred king|sets a ruler apart as a divine being]], as in \"the divine right\" of European kings, or the divine Japanese Emperor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=130}}</ref>  Political rituals also emerge in the form of uncodified or codified conventions practiced by political officials that cement respect for the arrangements of an institution or role against the individual temporarily assuming it, as can be seen in the many rituals still observed within the procedure of [[parliament]]ary bodies.\n\nRitual can be used as a form of resistance, as for example, in the various [[Cargo cults|Cargo Cults]] that developed against colonial powers in the South Pacific. In such religio-political movements, Islanders would use ritual imitations of western practices (such as the building of landing strips) as a means of summoning cargo (manufactured goods) from the ancestors. Leaders of these groups characterized the present state (often imposed by colonial capitalist regimes) as a dismantling of the old social order, which they sought to restore.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worsley|first=Peter|title=The Trumpet Shall Sound: A Study of 'Cargo Cults' in Melanesia|year=1957|publisher=Schocken books|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==Anthropological theories==\n===Functionalism===\n{{main|Structural functionalism}}\n\nNineteenth century \"[[History of anthropology|armchair anthropologists]]\" were concerned with the basic question of how religion originated in human history. In the twentieth century their conjectural histories were replaced with new concerns around the question of what these beliefs and practices did for societies, regardless of their origin. In this view, religion was a universal, and while its content might vary enormously, it served certain basic functions such as the provision of prescribed solutions to basic human psychological and social problems, as well as expressing the central values of a society. [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] used the concept of function to address questions of individual psychological needs; [[A.R. Radcliffe-Brown]], in contrast, looked for the function (purpose) of the institution or custom in preserving or maintaining society as a whole. They thus disagreed about the relationship of anxiety to ritual.<ref>{{cite book|last=William A. Lessa|first=Evon Z.

Homans]] sought to resolve these opposing theories by differentiating between \"primary anxieties\" felt by people who lack the techniques to secure results, and \"secondary (or displaced) anxiety\" felt by those who have not performed the rites meant to allay primary anxiety correctly. Homans argued that purification rituals may then be conducted to dispel secondary anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=George C.|title=Anxiety and Ritual: The Theories of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1941|volume=43|issue=2|pages=164\u201372|doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.2.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nA.R. Radcliffe-Brown argued that ritual should be distinguished from technical action, viewing it as a structured event: \"ritual acts differ from technical acts in having in all instances some expressive or symbolic element in them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=A.R.|title=Structure and Function in Primitive Society|year=1939|publisher=Cohen and West|location=London|page=143}}</ref> [[Edmund Leach]], in contrast, saw ritual and technical action less as separate structural types of activity and more as a spectrum: \"Actions fall into place on a continuous scale. At one extreme we have actions which are entirely profane, entirely functional, technique pure and simple; at the other we have actions which are entirely sacred, strictly aesthetic, technically non-functional. Between these two extremes we have the great majority of social actions which partake partly of the one sphere and partly of the other. From this point of view technique and ritual, profane and sacred, do not denote ''types'' of action but ''aspects'' of almost any kind of action.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Edmund|title=Political Systems of Highland Burma|year=1954|publisher=Bell|location=London|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n====As social control====\n[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|Balinese rice terraces regulated through ritual.]]\n{{see also|social control}}\nThe [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] model viewed ritual as a [[homeostatic]] mechanism to regulate and stabilize social institutions by adjusting [[social interaction]]s, maintaining a [[social group|group]] [[ethos]], and restoring harmony after disputes.\n\nAlthough the functionalist model was soon superseded, later \"neofunctional\" theorists adopted its approach by examining the ways that ritual regulated larger ecological systems. [[Roy Rappaport]], for example, examined the way [[Moka exchange|gift exchanges of pigs]] between tribal groups in [[Papua New Guinea]] maintained environmental balance between humans, available food (with pigs sharing the same foodstuffs as humans) and resource base. Rappaport concluded that ritual, \"...helps to maintain an undegraded environment, limits fighting to frequencies which do not endanger the existence of regional population, adjusts man-land ratios, facilitates trade, distributes local surpluses of pig throughout the regional population in the form of pork, and assures people of high quality protein when they are most in need of it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Roy|title=Ecology, Meaning and Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/ecologymeaningre00roya|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Richmond, CA|page=[https://archive.org/details/ecologymeaningre00roya/page/41 41]}}</ref> Similarly, [[J. Stephen Lansing]] traced how the [[Pawukon|intricate calendar]] of [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu Balinese]] rituals served to regulate the vast [[irrigation system]]s of Bali, ensuring the optimum distribution of water over the system while limiting disputes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lansing|first=Stephen|title=Priests and Programmers: technologies of power in the engineered landscape of Bali|url=https://archive.org/details/priestsprogramme0000lans|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref>\n\n====Rebellion====\nWhile most Functionalists sought to link ritual to the maintenance of social order, South African [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]] coined the phrase \"rituals of rebellion\" to describe a type of ritual in which the accepted social order was symbolically turned on its head. Gluckman argued that the ritual was an expression of underlying social tensions (an idea taken up by [[Victor W. Turner|Victor Turner]]), and that it functioned as an institutional pressure valve, relieving those tensions through these cyclical performances. The rites ultimately functioned to reinforce social order, insofar as they allowed those tensions to be expressed without leading to actual rebellion. [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival]] is viewed in the same light. He observed, for example, how the first-fruits festival (''[[incwala]]'') of the South African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] kingdom of [[Swaziland]] symbolically inverted the normal social order, so that the king was publicly insulted, women asserted their domination over men, and the established authority of elders over the young was turned upside down.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gluckman|first=Max|title=Order and Rebellion in South East Africa: Collected Essays|year=1963|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Structuralism===\n{{main|Structuralism}}\n\n[[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], the French anthropologist, regarded all social and cultural organization as symbolic systems of communication shaped by the inherent structure of the human brain. He therefore argued that the symbol systems are not reflections of social structure as the Functionalists believed, but are imposed on social relations to organize them. L\u00e9vi-Strauss thus viewed myth and ritual as complementary symbol systems, one verbal, one non-verbal. L\u00e9vi-Strauss was not concerned to develop a theory of ritual (although he did produce a four-volume analysis of myth) but was influential to later scholars of ritual such as [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Edmund Leach]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=42\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Structure and anti-structure===\n[[Victor Turner]] combined [[Arnold van Gennep]]'s model of the structure of initiation rites, and Gluckman's functionalist emphasis on the ritualization of social conflict to maintain social equilibrium, with a more structural model of symbols in ritual. Running counter to this emphasis on structured symbolic oppositions within a ritual was his exploration of the liminal phase of rites of passage, a phase in which \"anti-structure\" appears. In this phase, opposed states such as birth and death may be encompassed by a single act, object or phrase. The dynamic nature of symbols experienced in ritual provides a compelling personal experience; ritual is a \"mechanism that periodically converts the obligatory into the desirable\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=30}}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Douglas]], a British Functionalist, extended Turner's theory of ritual structure and anti-structure with her own contrasting set of terms \"grid\" and \"group\" in the book ''Natural Symbols''. Drawing on Levi-Strauss' Structuralist approach, she saw ritual as symbolic communication that constrained social behaviour. Grid is a scale referring to the degree to which a symbolic system is a shared frame of reference. Group refers to the degree people are tied into a tightly knit community. When graphed on two intersecting axes, four quadrants are possible: strong group/strong grid, strong group/weak grid, weak group/weak grid, weak group/strong grid. Douglas argued that societies with strong group or strong grid were marked by more ritual activity than those weak in either group or grid (see also, section \"Ritual as a Methodological Measure of Religiosity\" below).<ref>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Natural Symbols: Explorations in Cosmology|year=1973|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-structure and communitas====\n{{main|Communitas}}\nIn his analysis of [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], Victor Turner argued that the liminal phase - that period 'betwixt and between' - was marked by \"two models of human interrelatedness, juxtaposed and alternating\": structure and anti-structure (or ''communitas'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=96}}</ref> While the ritual clearly articulated the cultural ideals of a society through ritual symbolism, the unrestrained festivities of the liminal period served to break down social barriers and to join the group into an undifferentiated unity with \"no status, property, insignia, secular clothing, rank, kinship position, nothing to demarcate themselves from their fellows\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=96\u201397}}</ref> These periods of symbolic inversion have been studied in a diverse range of rituals such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[Yom Kippur]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=128}}</ref>\n\n====Social dramas====\nBeginning with Max Gluckman's concept of \"rituals of rebellion\", Victor Turner argued that many types of ritual also served as \"social dramas\" through which structural social tensions could be expressed, and temporarily resolved. Drawing on Van Gennep's model of initiation rites, Turner viewed these social dramas as a dynamic process through which the community renewed itself through the ritual creation of communitas during the \"liminal phase\". Turner analyzed the ritual events in 4 stages: breach in relations, crisis, redressive actions, and acts of reintegration. Like Gluckman, he argued these rituals maintain social order while facilitating disordered inversions, thereby moving people to a new status, just as in an initiation rite.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Anthropology and Anthropologists: The Modern British School|url=https://archive.org/details/anthropologyanth0000kupe|url-access=registration|year=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthropologyanth0000kupe/page/156 156\u201357]}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolic approaches to ritual===\n{{rquote|right|Arguments, melodies, formulas, maps and pictures are not idealities to be stared at but texts to be read; so are rituals, palaces, technologies, and social formations|Clifford Geertz (1980)<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: the Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|url=https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=[https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1/page/135 135]}}</ref> }}\n\n[[Clifford Geertz]] also expanded on the symbolic approach to ritual that began with Victor Turner. Geertz argued that religious symbol systems provided both a \"model of\" reality (showing how to interpret the world as is) as well as a \"model for\" reality (clarifying its ideal state). The role of ritual, according to Geertz, is to bring these two aspects \u2013 the \"model of\" and the \"model for\" \u2013 together: \"it is in ritual \u2013 that is consecrated behaviour \u2013 that this conviction that religious conceptions are veridical and that religious directives are sound is somehow generated.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|url=https://archive.org/details/interpretationof00geer_1|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/interpretationof00geer_1/page/112 112]}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic anthropologists like Geertz analyzed rituals as language-like codes to be interpreted independently as cultural systems. Geertz rejected Functionalist arguments that ritual describes social order, arguing instead that ritual actively shapes that social order and imposes meaning on disordered experience. He also differed from Gluckman and Turner's emphasis on ritual action as a means of resolving social passion, arguing instead that it simply displayed them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===As a form of communication===\nWhereas Victor Turner saw in ritual the potential to release people from the binding structures of their lives into a liberating anti-structure or communitas, Maurice Bloch argued that ritual produced conformity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes-Freeland|first=Felicia (ed.)|title=Ritual, Performance, Media|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Maurice Bloch]] argued that ritual communication is unusual in that it uses a special, restricted vocabulary, a small number of permissible illustrations, and a restrictive grammar. As a result, ritual utterances become very predictable, and the speaker is made anonymous in that they have little choice in what to say. The restrictive syntax reduces the ability of the speaker to make propositional arguments, and they are left, instead, with utterances that cannot be contradicted such as \"I do thee wed\" in a wedding. These kinds of utterances, known as [[performatives]], prevent speakers from making political arguments through logical argument, and are typical of what Weber called [[traditional authority]] instead.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Maurice|title=Symbols, Song, Dance and Features of Articulation: Is Religion an Extreme Form of Traditional Authority?|journal=Archives Europ\u00e9ennes de Sociologie|year=1974|volume=15|issue=1|pages=55\u201384|doi=10.1017/s0003975600002824}}</ref>\n\nBloch's model of ritual language denies the possibility of creativity. Thomas Csordas, in contrast, analyzes how ritual language can be used to innovate. Csordas looks at groups of rituals that share performative elements (\"genres\" of ritual with a shared \"poetics\"). These rituals may fall along the spectrum of formality, with some less, others more formal and restrictive. Csordas argues that innovations may be introduced in less formalized rituals. As these innovations become more accepted and standardized, they are slowly adopted in more formal rituals.

[[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] has extended this idea by shifting attention from ritual as a category, to the processes of \"ritualization\" by which ritual is created as a cultural form in a society. Ritualization is \"a way of acting that is designed and orchestrated to distinguish and privilege what is being done in comparison to other, usually more quotidian, activities\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=74}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Myth and ritual|Theories about religions}}\n[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Aztec]] ritual human sacrifices, [[Codex Mendoza]].]]\n[[File:Saying Juma Namaz (Friday prayer for Muslims), Dhaka, Bangladesh NK.JPG|thumb|200px|Friday prayer for [[Muslim]]s in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh]]\nIn [[religion]], a ritual can comprise the prescribed outward forms of performing the ''cultus'', or [[cult (religion)|cult]], of a particular observation within a religion or [[religious denomination]].

Even common actions like [[handshake|hand-shaking]] and saying \"[[hello]]\" may be termed as ''rituals''.\n\nThe field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or \"[[Emic and etic|etic]]\" category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. The term can be used also by the insider or \"[[Emic and etic|emic]]\" performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kyriakidis|first=E., ed.|title=The archaeology of ritual.|year=2007|publisher=Cotsen Institute of Archaeology UCLA publications}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Psychology}}\nIn [[psychology]], the term ''ritual'' is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''ritual'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''ritualis,'' \"that which pertains to [[wikt:rite|rite]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus|ritus]]'')\". In Roman [[Roman law|juridical]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]] usage, ''ritus'' was the proven way ''([[mos maiorum|mos]])'' of doing something,<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], entry on ''ritus'', p. 364 (edition of Lindsay).</ref> or \"correct performance, custom\".<ref>Barbara Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" in ''Religion in the Making: The Emergence of the Sciences of Religion'' (Brill, 1998), p. 278.</ref> The original concept of ''ritus'' may be related to the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Rta|\u1e5bt\u00e1]]'' (\"visible order)\" in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], \"the lawful and regular order of the normal, and therefore proper, natural and true structure of cosmic, worldly, human and ritual events\".<ref>Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" p. 278.</ref> The word \"ritual\" is first recorded in English in 1570, and came into use in the 1600s to mean \"the prescribed order of performing religious services\" or more particularly a book of these prescriptions.<ref>Boudewijnse, \"British Roots of the Concept of Ritual,\" p. 278, citing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|actions}}Characteristics ==\n\nThere are hardly any limits to the kind of actions that may be incorporated into a ritual. The rites of past and present societies have typically involved special gestures and words, recitation of fixed texts, performance of special [[music]], [[singing|songs]] or [[dance]]s, processions, manipulation of certain objects, use of special dresses, consumption of special [[food]], [[drink]], or [[entheogen|drugs]], and much more.<ref>(Tolbert 1990a, 1990b; Wilce 2006)</ref>\n\n[[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] argues that rituals can be characterized by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism and performance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=138\u201369}}</ref>\n\n=== Formalism ===\n\n[[File:IteMissaEst.jpg|thumb|The use of Latin in a Tridentine Catholic Mass is an example of a \"restricted code\".]]\n\nRitual utilizes a limited and rigidly organized set of expressions which [[anthropologist]]s call a \"restricted code\" (in opposition to a more open \"elaborated code\"). Maurice Bloch argues that ritual obliges participants to use this formal oratorical style, which is limited in intonation, syntax, vocabulary, loudness, and fixity of order. In adopting this style, ritual leaders' speech becomes more style than content. Because this formal speech limits what can be said, it induces \"acceptance, compliance, or at least forbearance with regard to any overt challenge\". Bloch argues that this form of ritual communication makes rebellion impossible and revolution the only feasible alternative. Ritual tends to support traditional forms of social hierarchy and authority, and maintains the assumptions on which the authority is based from challenge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=139\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Traditionalism===\n[[File:The First Thanksgiving cph.3g04961.jpg|thumb|''The First Thanksgiving 1621'', oil on canvas by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]] (1863\u20131930).

Traditionalism varies from formalism in that the ritual may not be formal yet still makes an appeal to the historical trend. An example is the American Thanksgiving dinner, which may not be formal, yet is ostensibly based on an event from the early Puritan settlement of America. Historians [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Terrence Ranger]] have argued that many of these are ''[[invented traditions]]'', such as the rituals of the British monarchy, which invoke \"thousand year-old tradition\" but whose actual form originate in the late nineteenth century, to some extent reviving earlier forms, in this case medieval, that had been discontinued in the meantime. Thus, the appeal to history is important rather than accurate historical transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=145\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Invariance===\n[[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] states that ritual is also invariant, implying careful choreography. This is less an appeal to traditionalism than a striving for timeless repetition. The key to invariance is bodily discipline, as in monastic prayer and meditation meant to mold dispositions and moods. This bodily discipline is frequently performed in unison, by groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=152\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Rule-governance===\nRituals tend to be governed by rules, a feature somewhat like formalism. Rules impose norms on the chaos of behavior, either defining the outer limits of what is acceptable or choreographing each move. Individuals are held to communally approved customs that evoke a legitimate communal authority that can constrain the possible outcomes. Historically, War in most societies has been bound by highly ritualized constraints that limit the legitimate means by which war was waged.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=155}}</ref>\n\n===Sacrifice===\nActivities appealing to supernatural beings are easily considered rituals, although the appeal may be quite indirect, expressing only a generalized belief in the existence of the sacred demanding a human response. National flags, for example, may be considered more than signs representing a country. The flag stands for larger symbols such as freedom, democracy, free enterprise or national superiority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=156}}</ref> Anthropologist Sherry Ortner writes that the flag\n<blockquote>does not encourage reflection on the logical relations among these ideas, nor on the logical consequences of them as they are played out in social actuality, over time and history. On the contrary, the flag encourages a sort of all-or-nothing allegiance to the whole package, best summed [by] 'Our flag, love it or leave.'<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ortner|first=Sherry|title=On Key Symbols|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1973|volume=75|issue=5|page=1340|doi=10.1525/aa.1973.75.5.02a00100}}</ref></blockquote>\nParticular objects become sacral symbols through a process of [[consecration]] which effectively creates the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred]] by setting it apart from the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|profane]]. Boy Scouts and the armed forces in any country teach the official ways of folding, saluting and raising the flag, thus emphasizing that the flag should never be treated as just a piece of cloth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=156\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Performance===\nThe performance of ritual creates a theatrical-like frame around the activities, symbols and events that shape participant's experience and cognitive ordering of the world, simplifying the chaos of life and imposing a more or less coherent system of categories of meaning onto it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=156\u201357}}</ref> As Barbara Myerhoff put it, \"not only is seeing believing, doing is believing.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Myerhoff|first=Barbara|title=Secular Ritual|year=1997|publisher=Van Gorcum|location=Amsterdam|page=223}}</ref>\n\n==Genres==\n{{rquote|right|A ritual is a stereotyped sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and designed to influence preternatural entities or forces on behalf of the actors' goals and interests. Rituals may be seasonal, hallowing a culturally defined moment of change in the climatic cycle or the inauguration of an activity such as planting, harvesting, or moving from winter to summer pasture; or they may be contingent, held in response to an individual or collective crisis. Contingent rituals may be further subdivided into life-crisis ceremonies, which are performed at birth, puberty, marriage, death, and so on, to demarcate the passage from one phase to another in the individual's life-cycle, and rituals of affliction, which are performed to placate or exorcise preternatural beings or forces believed to have afflicted villagers with illness, bad luck, gynecological troubles, severe physical injuries, and the like. Other classes of rituals include divinatory rituals; ceremonies performed by political authorities to ensure the health and fertility of human beings, animals, and crops in their territories; initiation into priesthoods devoted to certain deities, into religious associations, or into secret societies; and those accompanying the daily offering of food and libations to deities or ancestral spirits or both.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Symbols in African Ritual (16 March 1973)|journal=Science|volume=179|issue=4078|pages=1100\u20131105|doi=10.1126/science.179.4078.1100|pmid=17788268|year=1973|last1=Turner|first1=V.

Arnold van Gennep stated that rites of passage are marked by three stages: separation, transition and incorporation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=94}}</ref> In the first stage, the initiates are separated from their old identities through physical and symbolic means. In the transition phase, they are \"betwixt and between\". [[Victor Turner]] argued that this stage is marked by [[liminality]], a condition of ambiguity or disorientation in which initiates have been stripped of their old identities, but have not yet acquired their new one. Turner states \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=95}}</ref>  In this stage of liminality or \"anti-structure\" (see below), the initiates' role ambiguity creates a sense of [[communitas]] or emotional bond of community between them. This stage may be marked by ritual ordeals or ritual training. In the final stage of incorporation, the initiates are symbolically confirmed in their new identity and community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}</ref>\n\n===Calendrical and commemorative rites===\nCalendrical and commemorative rites are ritual events marking particular times of year, or a fixed period since an important event. Calendrical rituals give social meaning to the passage of time, creating repetitive weekly, monthly or yearly cycles. Some rites are oriented towards seasonal changes, and may be fixed by the [[Solar calendar|solar]] or [[lunar calendar]]. Those fixed by the solar calendar fall on the same day (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as [[New Year's Day]] on the first of January) while those calculated by the lunar calendar fall on different dates (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as [[Chinese New Year|Chinese lunar New Year]]). Calendrical rites impose a cultural order on nature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=102\u201303}}</ref> Mircea Eliade states that the calendrical rituals of many religious traditions recall and commemorate the basic beliefs of a community, and their yearly celebration establishes a link between past and present, as if the original events are happening over again: \"Thus the gods did; thus men do.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Eliade|first=Mircea|title=The Myth of Eternal Return or, Cosmos and History|year=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=21}}</ref>\n\n===Rites of exchange and communion===\nThis genre of ritual encompasses forms of sacrifice and offering meant to praise, please or placate divine powers. According to early anthropologist Edward Tylor, such sacrifices are [[Gift economy|gifts]] given in hope of a return. [[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]], however, points out that sacrifice covers a range of practices from those that are manipulative and \"magical\" to those of pure devotion. Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]], for example, appear to have no other purpose than to please the deity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=109}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Marcel Mauss]], sacrifice is distinguished from other forms of offering by being consecrated, and hence sanctified. As a consequence, the offering is usually destroyed in the ritual to transfer it to the deities.\n\n===Rites of affliction===\n{{main|Shamanism|Divination}}\nAnthropologist Victor Turner defines rites of affliction actions that seek to mitigate spirits that inflict humans with misfortune. These rites may include forms of spirit [[divination]] (consulting [[oracles]]) to establish causes\u2014and rituals that heal, purify, exorcise, and protect. The misfortune experienced may include individual health, but also broader climate-related issues such as drought or plagues of insects. Healing rites performed by [[shamans]] frequently identify social disorder as the cause, and make the restoration of social relationships the cure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=9ff}}</ref>\n\nTurner uses the example of the Isoma ritual among the Ndembu of northwestern [[Zambia]] to illustrate. The Isoma rite of affliction is used to cure a childless woman of infertility. Infertility is the result of a \"structural tension between [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent and [[Virilocality|virilocal]] marriage\" (i.e., the tension a woman feels between her mother's family, to whom she owes allegiance, and her husband's family among whom she must live). \"It is because the woman has come too closely in touch with the 'man's side' in her marriage that her dead matrikin have impaired her fertility.\" To correct the balance of matrilinial descent and marriage, the Isoma ritual dramatically placates the deceased spirits by requiring the woman to reside with her mother's kin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n[[File:Carnaval Venecia 14feb2009.jpg|thumb|Masquerade at the [[Carnival of Venice]].]]\nShamanic and other ritual may effect a psychotherapeutic cure, leading anthropologists such as Jane Atkinson to theorize how. Atkinson argues that the effectiveness of a shamanic ritual for an individual may depend upon a wider audiences acknowledging the shaman's power, which may lead to the shaman placing greater emphasis on engaging the audience than in the healing of the patient.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Jane|title=The Effectiveness of Shamans in an Indonesian Ritual|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1987|volume=89|issue=2|page=342|doi=10.1525/aa.1987.89.2.02a00040}}</ref>\n\n===Rites of feasting, fasting and festivals===\nRites of feasting and fasting are those through which a community publicly expresses an adherence to basic, shared religious values, rather than to the overt presence of deities as is found in rites of affliction where feasting or fasting may also take place. It encompasses a range of performances such as communal fasting during [[Ramadan]] by Muslims; the [[Moka exchange|slaughter of pigs]] in New Guinea; [[Carnival]] festivities; or penitential processions in Catholicism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=121}}</ref> Victor Turner described this \"cultural performance\" of basic values a \"social drama\". Such dramas allow the social stresses that are inherent in a particular culture to be expressed and worked out symbolically in a ritual catharsis; as the social tensions continue to persist outside the ritual, pressure mounts for the ritual's cyclical performance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society|url=https://archive.org/details/dramasfieldsmeta00turn|url-access=registration|year=1974|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dramasfieldsmeta00turn/page/23 23\u201335]}}</ref> In Carnival, for example, the practice of masking allows people to be what they are not, and acts as a general social leveller, erasing otherwise tense social hierarchies in a festival that emphasizes play outside the bounds of normal social limits.

In such religio-political movements, Islanders would use ritual imitations of western practices (such as the building of landing strips) as a means of summoning cargo (manufactured goods) from the ancestors. Leaders of these groups characterized the present state (often imposed by colonial capitalist regimes) as a dismantling of the old social order, which they sought to restore.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worsley|first=Peter|title=The Trumpet Shall Sound: A Study of 'Cargo Cults' in Melanesia|year=1957|publisher=Schocken books|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==Anthropological theories==\n===Functionalism===\n{{main|Structural functionalism}}\n\nNineteenth century \"[[History of anthropology|armchair anthropologists]]\" were concerned with the basic question of how religion originated in human history. In the twentieth century their conjectural histories were replaced with new concerns around the question of what these beliefs and practices did for societies, regardless of their origin. In this view, religion was a universal, and while its content might vary enormously, it served certain basic functions such as the provision of prescribed solutions to basic human psychological and social problems, as well as expressing the central values of a society. [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] used the concept of function to address questions of individual psychological needs; [[A.R. Radcliffe-Brown]], in contrast, looked for the function (purpose) of the institution or custom in preserving or maintaining society as a whole. They thus disagreed about the relationship of anxiety to ritual.<ref>{{cite book|last=William A. Lessa|first=Evon Z.

Homans]] sought to resolve these opposing theories by differentiating between \"primary anxieties\" felt by people who lack the techniques to secure results, and \"secondary (or displaced) anxiety\" felt by those who have not performed the rites meant to allay primary anxiety correctly. Homans argued that purification rituals may then be conducted to dispel secondary anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=George C.|title=Anxiety and Ritual: The Theories of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1941|volume=43|issue=2|pages=164\u201372|doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.2.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nA.R. Radcliffe-Brown argued that ritual should be distinguished from technical action, viewing it as a structured event: \"ritual acts differ from technical acts in having in all instances some expressive or symbolic element in them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=A.R.|title=Structure and Function in Primitive Society|year=1939|publisher=Cohen and West|location=London|page=143}}</ref> [[Edmund Leach]], in contrast, saw ritual and technical action less as separate structural types of activity and more as a spectrum: \"Actions fall into place on a continuous scale. At one extreme we have actions which are entirely profane, entirely functional, technique pure and simple; at the other we have actions which are entirely sacred, strictly aesthetic, technically non-functional. Between these two extremes we have the great majority of social actions which partake partly of the one sphere and partly of the other. From this point of view technique and ritual, profane and sacred, do not denote ''types'' of action but ''aspects'' of almost any kind of action.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Edmund|title=Political Systems of Highland Burma|year=1954|publisher=Bell|location=London|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n====As social control====\n[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|Balinese rice terraces regulated through ritual.]]\n{{see also|social control}}\nThe [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] model viewed ritual as a [[homeostatic]] mechanism to regulate and stabilize social institutions by adjusting [[social interaction]]s, maintaining a [[social group|group]] [[ethos]], and restoring harmony after disputes.\n\nAlthough the functionalist model was soon superseded, later \"neofunctional\" theorists adopted its approach by examining the ways that ritual regulated larger ecological systems. [[Roy Rappaport]], for example, examined the way [[Moka exchange|gift exchanges of pigs]] between tribal groups in [[Papua New Guinea]] maintained environmental balance between humans, available food (with pigs sharing the same foodstuffs as humans) and resource base. Rappaport concluded that ritual, \"...helps to maintain an undegraded environment, limits fighting to frequencies which do not endanger the existence of regional population, adjusts man-land ratios, facilitates trade, distributes local surpluses of pig throughout the regional population in the form of pork, and assures people of high quality protein when they are most in need of it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Roy|title=Ecology, Meaning and Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/ecologymeaningre00roya|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Richmond, CA|page=[https://archive.org/details/ecologymeaningre00roya/page/41 41]}}</ref> Similarly, [[J.

Gluckman argued that the ritual was an expression of underlying social tensions (an idea taken up by [[Victor W. Turner|Victor Turner]]), and that it functioned as an institutional pressure valve, relieving those tensions through these cyclical performances. The rites ultimately functioned to reinforce social order, insofar as they allowed those tensions to be expressed without leading to actual rebellion. [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival]] is viewed in the same light. He observed, for example, how the first-fruits festival (''[[incwala]]'') of the South African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] kingdom of [[Swaziland]] symbolically inverted the normal social order, so that the king was publicly insulted, women asserted their domination over men, and the established authority of elders over the young was turned upside down.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gluckman|first=Max|title=Order and Rebellion in South East Africa: Collected Essays|year=1963|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Structuralism===\n{{main|Structuralism}}\n\n[[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], the French anthropologist, regarded all social and cultural organization as symbolic systems of communication shaped by the inherent structure of the human brain. He therefore argued that the symbol systems are not reflections of social structure as the Functionalists believed, but are imposed on social relations to organize them. L\u00e9vi-Strauss thus viewed myth and ritual as complementary symbol systems, one verbal, one non-verbal. L\u00e9vi-Strauss was not concerned to develop a theory of ritual (although he did produce a four-volume analysis of myth) but was influential to later scholars of ritual such as [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Edmund Leach]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=42\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Structure and anti-structure===\n[[Victor Turner]] combined [[Arnold van Gennep]]'s model of the structure of initiation rites, and Gluckman's functionalist emphasis on the ritualization of social conflict to maintain social equilibrium, with a more structural model of symbols in ritual. Running counter to this emphasis on structured symbolic oppositions within a ritual was his exploration of the liminal phase of rites of passage, a phase in which \"anti-structure\" appears. In this phase, opposed states such as birth and death may be encompassed by a single act, object or phrase. The dynamic nature of symbols experienced in ritual provides a compelling personal experience; ritual is a \"mechanism that periodically converts the obligatory into the desirable\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=30}}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Douglas]], a British Functionalist, extended Turner's theory of ritual structure and anti-structure with her own contrasting set of terms \"grid\" and \"group\" in the book ''Natural Symbols''. Drawing on Levi-Strauss' Structuralist approach, she saw ritual as symbolic communication that constrained social behaviour. Grid is a scale referring to the degree to which a symbolic system is a shared frame of reference. Group refers to the degree people are tied into a tightly knit community. When graphed on two intersecting axes, four quadrants are possible: strong group/strong grid, strong group/weak grid, weak group/weak grid, weak group/strong grid. Douglas argued that societies with strong group or strong grid were marked by more ritual activity than those weak in either group or grid (see also, section \"Ritual as a Methodological Measure of Religiosity\" below).<ref>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Natural Symbols: Explorations in Cosmology|year=1973|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-structure and communitas====\n{{main|Communitas}}\nIn his analysis of [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], Victor Turner argued that the liminal phase - that period 'betwixt and between' - was marked by \"two models of human interrelatedness, juxtaposed and alternating\": structure and anti-structure (or ''communitas'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure|year=1969|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=96}}</ref> While the ritual clearly articulated the cultural ideals of a society through ritual symbolism, the unrestrained festivities of the liminal period served to break down social barriers and to join the group into an undifferentiated unity with \"no status, property, insignia, secular clothing, rank, kinship position, nothing to demarcate themselves from their fellows\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Victor|title=The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=96\u201397}}</ref> These periods of symbolic inversion have been studied in a diverse range of rituals such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[Yom Kippur]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=128}}</ref>\n\n====Social dramas====\nBeginning with Max Gluckman's concept of \"rituals of rebellion\", Victor Turner argued that many types of ritual also served as \"social dramas\" through which structural social tensions could be expressed, and temporarily resolved. Drawing on Van Gennep's model of initiation rites, Turner viewed these social dramas as a dynamic process through which the community renewed itself through the ritual creation of communitas during the \"liminal phase\". Turner analyzed the ritual events in 4 stages: breach in relations, crisis, redressive actions, and acts of reintegration. Like Gluckman, he argued these rituals maintain social order while facilitating disordered inversions, thereby moving people to a new status, just as in an initiation rite.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Anthropology and Anthropologists: The Modern British School|url=https://archive.org/details/anthropologyanth0000kupe|url-access=registration|year=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthropologyanth0000kupe/page/156 156\u201357]}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolic approaches to ritual===\n{{rquote|right|Arguments, melodies, formulas, maps and pictures are not idealities to be stared at but texts to be read; so are rituals, palaces, technologies, and social formations|Clifford Geertz (1980)<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: the Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|url=https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=[https://archive.org/details/negaratheatresta00geer_1/page/135 135]}}</ref> }}\n\n[[Clifford Geertz]] also expanded on the symbolic approach to ritual that began with Victor Turner. Geertz argued that religious symbol systems provided both a \"model of\" reality (showing how to interpret the world as is) as well as a \"model for\" reality (clarifying its ideal state). The role of ritual, according to Geertz, is to bring these two aspects \u2013 the \"model of\" and the \"model for\" \u2013 together: \"it is in ritual \u2013 that is consecrated behaviour \u2013 that this conviction that religious conceptions are veridical and that religious directives are sound is somehow generated.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|url=https://archive.org/details/interpretationof00geer_1|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/interpretationof00geer_1/page/112 112]}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic anthropologists like Geertz analyzed rituals as language-like codes to be interpreted independently as cultural systems. Geertz rejected Functionalist arguments that ritual describes social order, arguing instead that ritual actively shapes that social order and imposes meaning on disordered experience. He also differed from Gluckman and Turner's emphasis on ritual action as a means of resolving social passion, arguing instead that it simply displayed them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===As a form of communication===\nWhereas Victor Turner saw in ritual the potential to release people from the binding structures of their lives into a liberating anti-structure or communitas, Maurice Bloch argued that ritual produced conformity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes-Freeland|first=Felicia (ed.)|title=Ritual, Performance, Media|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Maurice Bloch]] argued that ritual communication is unusual in that it uses a special, restricted vocabulary, a small number of permissible illustrations, and a restrictive grammar. As a result, ritual utterances become very predictable, and the speaker is made anonymous in that they have little choice in what to say. The restrictive syntax reduces the ability of the speaker to make propositional arguments, and they are left, instead, with utterances that cannot be contradicted such as \"I do thee wed\" in a wedding. These kinds of utterances, known as [[performatives]], prevent speakers from making political arguments through logical argument, and are typical of what Weber called [[traditional authority]] instead.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Maurice|title=Symbols, Song, Dance and Features of Articulation: Is Religion an Extreme Form of Traditional Authority?|journal=Archives Europ\u00e9ennes de Sociologie|year=1974|volume=15|issue=1|pages=55\u201384|doi=10.1017/s0003975600002824}}</ref>\n\nBloch's model of ritual language denies the possibility of creativity. Thomas Csordas, in contrast, analyzes how ritual language can be used to innovate. Csordas looks at groups of rituals that share performative elements (\"genres\" of ritual with a shared \"poetics\"). These rituals may fall along the spectrum of formality, with some less, others more formal and restrictive. Csordas argues that innovations may be introduced in less formalized rituals. As these innovations become more accepted and standardized, they are slowly adopted in more formal rituals. In this way, even the most formal of rituals are potential avenues for creative expression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Csordas|first=Thomas J.|title=Language, Charisma, & Creativity: Ritual Life in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal|year=2001 |origyear=1997|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke|pages=255\u201365}}</ref>\n\n===As a disciplinary program===\n[[File:Scriptorium-monk-at-work.jpg|thumb|Scriptorium-monk-at-work. \"Monks described this labor of transcribing manuscripts as being 'like prayer and fasting, a means of correcting one's unruly passions.'\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Asad |first=Talal |title=Genealogies of Religion|year=1993|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=64|chapter=Toward a genealogy of the concept of ritual}}</ref>]]\nIn his historical analysis of articles on ritual and rite in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', [[Talal Asad]] notes that from 1771 to 1852, the brief articles on ritual define it as a \"book directing the order and manner to be observed in performing divine service\" (i.e., as a script).

The point of monastic discipline was to learn skills and appropriate emotions. Asad contrasts his approach by concluding \"Symbols call for interpretation, and even as interpretive criteria are extended so interpretations can be multiplied. Disciplinary practices, on the other hand, cannot be varied so easily, because learning to develop moral capabilities is not the same thing as learning to invent representations.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Asad|first=Talal|title=Genealogies of Religion|year=1993|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=79|chapter=Toward a genealogy of the concept of ritual}}</ref>\n\n===Ritualization===\n{{Main|ritualization}}\n\nAsad's work critiqued the notion that there were universal characteristics of ritual to be found in all cases. [[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]] has extended this idea by shifting attention from ritual as a category, to the processes of \"ritualization\" by which ritual is created as a cultural form in a society. Ritualization is \"a way of acting that is designed and orchestrated to distinguish and privilege what is being done in comparison to other, usually more quotidian, activities\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=74}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Myth and ritual|Theories about religions}}\n[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Aztec]] ritual human sacrifices, [[Codex Mendoza]].]]\n[[File:Saying Juma Namaz (Friday prayer for Muslims), Dhaka, Bangladesh NK.JPG|thumb|200px|Friday prayer for [[Muslim]]s in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh]]\nIn [[religion]], a ritual can comprise the prescribed outward forms of performing the ''cultus'', or [[cult (religion)|cult]], of a particular observation within a religion or [[religious denomination]]. Although ritual is often used in context with worship performed in a church, the actual relationship between any religion's doctrine and its ritual(s) can vary considerably from organized religion to non-institutionalized spirituality, such as [[ayahuasca]] [[shamanism]] as practiced by the [[Urarina]] of the [[upper Amazon]].<ref>Dean, Bartholomew (2009).

Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], ritual may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. And ritual itself may be broken down into four dimensions; content, frequency, intensity\nand centrality. The content of a ritual may vary from ritual to ritual, as does the frequency of its practice, the intensity of the ritual (how much of an impact it has on the practitioner), and the centrality of the ritual (in that religious tradition).<ref>Verbit, M.F.

The westward protrusion of the Central Time Zone created by the Province of Saskatchewan's observance of CST indicates it exists in the MST zone but observes CST.]]\nThe [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Saskatchewan]] is geographically located in the [[Mountain Time Zone]].  However, most of the province observes [[Central Time Zone|Central Standard Time]] year-round. As a result, it is effectively on [[daylight saving time]] (DST) year round, as clocks are not turned back an hour in autumn when most jurisdictions return to standard time. \n\nThe city of [[Lloydminster]] is the only exception to this arrangement.  Located partly in Saskatchewan and partly in [[Alberta]], it observes Mountain Time year-round, and changes its clocks for DST.  Since Lloydminster does change its clocks, the time in Saskatchewan is the same in all parts of the province during the summer months.\n\nDuring the summer, clocks in the entire province match those of [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]].  During the winter, clocks in most of the province outside Lloydminster match those of [[Winnipeg]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1912, the first law was passed that called for the use of [[standard time]]. This law left the choice of [[time zone]] up to the municipal government.  The result was a patchwork of towns following either of the two neighbouring time zones ([[Mountain Standard Time]] or Central Standard Time) with or without daylight saving time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], all municipalities were forced to adopt daylight saving time to save on fuel, but were not forced to adopt the same time zone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nIn 1966, the Saskatchewan Provincial Government sought the help of a professional astronomer living in the province.  The Milton Study (Earl R.V. Milton - A submission to the Government of [[Saskatchewan]] regarding Time Zones in [[Saskatchewan]], 1966) a) concluded that Saskatchewan is in the Mountain Standard Time Zone,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and b) suggested that the three prairie provinces ([[Alberta]], Saskatchewan and [[Manitoba]]) covered too much area to share a single time zone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nIn 1966, based on the Milton Study, the Saskatchewan Government passed Chapter 85, to be known as the Time Act, 1966 (Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1966). The key points of this act were:\n*The eastern part of Saskatchewan will permanently be one hour ahead of Mountain Standard Time (the equivalent of Central Standard Time).\n*In the western part of Saskatchewan (i.e., all points west of [[Saskatoon]]), municipal governments will still be able to choose what time zone to follow.\n\nIn the early part of the twenty-first century, discussion was renewed over whether Saskatchewan should change its clocks to be in synch with other provinces.  And if so, whether to stay on Mountain Time, or move to a kind of double DST by going yet another hour ahead in the summer.  Premier [[Brad Wall]] had pledged to hold a referendum in the 2011 provincial election, but later decided against it, saying it would be a waste of money since polls consistently showed a strong majority favoured the status quo.\n\nThe only cities that chose not to match the rest of Saskatchewan's time zone were in the southwest, in the areas around [[Lloydminster]] and [[Swift Current]].  Part of Lloydminster spills into Alberta, which mandates the use of daylight saving time.  In order to keep clocks in sync throughout the city, Lloydminster chose to follow Alberta's practice of observing daylight saving time\u2014effectively placing Lloydminster and the surrounding area on Mountain Time year-round. Swift Current and surrounding communities also observed Mountain Time until April 30, 1972 when they changed to match the rest of the province.\n\nWith respect to some province-wide matters, such as provincial elections, CST is effectively used province-wide.   This means that during any provincial general election held when DST is not in effect in Lloydminster, polls in that city will open and close an hour earlier local time compared to the rest of the province.  For other matters (for example, liquor laws), the local time is always the effective time in Lloydminster.\n\nThe town of [[Creighton, Saskatchewan|Creighton]] which is across the border from the larger community of [[Flin Flon, Manitoba]] unofficially observes Central Daylight Time with the rest of Manitoba.  Unlike Lloydminster, Creighton's use of CDT has no legal sanction at the provincial level.  This has some interesting side effects - for example, liquor establishments in Creighton are able to stay open one hour later than establishments in Flin Flon whilst CDT is in effect since a liquor establishment in Creighton can only be bound to observe CST by provincial law.\n\n== Saskatchewan Time Zone ==\nDue to these discrepancies, many [[computer program]]s and major [[operating system]]s offer a distinct \"Saskatchewan\" option when listing time zone options that automatically disables DST. In the [[tz database]], both the America/Regina and America/Swift_Current entries result in Saskatchewan time.\n\nThe current wording of the Time Act says that during the entire year Saskatchewan observes \"central standard time\", which is defined to be \"the time that is six hours behind [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich time]]\".

Reagents required for MDA reactions include: random primers and DNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi29. In 30 degree isothermal reaction, DNA is amplified with included reagents. As the [[polymerases]] manufacture new strands, a strand displacement reaction takes place, synthesizing multiple copies from each template DNA. At the same time, the strands that were extended antecedently will be displaced. MDA products result in a length of about 12 kb and ranges up to around 100 kb, enabling its use in DNA sequencing.<ref name=\"Lasken\" /> In 2017, a major improvement to this technique, called WGA-X, was introduced by taking advantage of a thermostable mutant of the phi29 polymerase, leading to better genome recovery from individual cells, in particular those with high G+C content.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stepanauskas R, Fergusson EA, Brown J, Poulton NJ, Tupper B, Labont\u00e9 JM, Becraft ED, Brown JM, Pachiadaki MG, Povilaitis T, Thompson BP, Mascena CJ, Bellows WK, Lubys A | display-authors = 6 | title = Improved genome recovery and integrated cell-size analyses of individual uncultured microbial cells and viral particles | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 84 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28729688 | pmc = 5519541 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-017-00128-z | bibcode = 2017NatCo...8...84S }}</ref> MDA has also been implemented in a microfluidic droplet-based system to achieve a highly parallelized single-cell whole genome amplification.

As the preliminary amplicons are generated, the common sequence promotes self-ligation and the formation of \u201cloops\u201d to prevent further amplification. In contrast with MDA, the highly branched DNA network is not formed. Instead, in another temperature cycle, the loops are denatured, allowing the fragments to be amplified with PCR. MALBAC has also been implemented in a microfluidic device, but the amplification performance was not significantly improved by encapsulation in nanoliter droplets.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu Z, Lu S, Huang Y | title = Microfluidic whole genome amplification device for single cell sequencing | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 19 | pages = 9386\u201390 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25233049 | doi = 10.1021/ac5032176 }}</ref>\n\nComparing MDA and MALBAC, MDA results in better genome coverage, but MALBAC provides more even coverage across the genome. MDA could be more effective for identifying [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]], whereas MALBAC is preferred for detecting copy number variants. While performing MDA with a microfluidic device markedly reduces bias and contamination, the chemistry involved in MALBAC does not demonstrate the same potential for improved efficiency. The choice of method depends on the goal of the sequencing because each method presents different advantages.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Limitations ===\nMDA of individual cell genomes results in highly uneven genome coverage, i.e. relative overrepresentation and underrepresentation of various regions of the template, leading to loss of some sequences. There are two components to this process: a) stochastic over- and under-amplification of random regions; and b) systematic bias against high %GC regions. The stochastic component may be addressed by pooling single-cell MDA reactions from the same cell type, by employing [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) and/or post-sequencing confirmation.<ref name=\"Lasken\" /> The bias of MDA against high %GC regions can be addressed by using thermostable polymerases, such as in the process called WGA-X.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), which are a big part of genetic variation in the [[human genome]], and [[copy number variation]] (CNV), pose problems in single cell sequencing, as well as the limited amount of DNA extracted from a single cell. Due to scant amounts of DNA, accurate analysis of DNA poses problems even after amplification since coverage is low and is susceptible to errors. With MDA, average genome coverage is less than 80% and SNPs that are not covered by sequencing reads will be opted out. In addition, MDA shows a high ratio of [[allele]] dropout, not detecting alleles from heterozygous samples. Various SNP algorithms are currently in use but none are specific to single cell sequencing. MDA with CNV also poses the problem of identifying false CNVs that conceal the real CNVs.

tail]] capture to enrich mRNA and deplete abundant and uninformative rRNA. Thus, they are often restricted to sequencing polyadenylated mRNA molecules. However, recent studies are now starting to appreciate the importance of non-poly(A) RNA, such as long-noncoding RNA and microRNAs in gene expression regulation. Small-seq is a single-cell method that captures small RNAs (<300 nucleotides) such as microRNAs, fragments of tRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hagemann-Jensen M, Abdullayev I, Sandberg R, Faridani OR | title = Small-seq for single-cell small-RNA sequencing | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 2407\u20132424 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30250291 | doi = 10.1038/s41596-018-0049-y }}</ref> This method uses a combination of \u201coligonucleotide masks\u201d (that inhibit the capture of highly abundant 5.8S rRNA molecules) and size selection to exclude large RNA species such as other highly abundant rRNA molecules. To target larger non-poly(A) RNAs, such as long non-coding mRNA, histone mRNA, circular RNA, and enhancer RNA, size selection is not applicable for depleting the highly abundant ribosomal RNA molecules (18S and 28s rRNA).<ref name=\"Hayashi 619\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayashi T, Ozaki H, Sasagawa Y, Umeda M, Danno H, Nikaido I | title = Single-cell full-length total RNA sequencing uncovers dynamics of recursive splicing and enhancer RNAs | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 619 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29434199 | pmc = 5809388 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-02866-0 | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9..619H }}</ref> Single-cell RamDA-Seq is a method that achieves this by performing reverse transcription with random priming (random displacement amplification) in the presence of \u201cnot so random\u201d (NSR) primers specifically designed to avoid priming on rRNA molecule.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Armour CD, Castle JC, Chen R, Babak T, Loerch P, Jackson S, Shah JK, Dey J, Rohl CA, Johnson JM, Raymond CK | display-authors = 6 | title = Digital transcriptome profiling using selective hexamer priming for cDNA synthesis | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 647\u20139 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19668204 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1360 }}</ref> While this method successfully captures full-length total RNA transcripts for sequencing and detected a variety of non-poly(A) RNAs with high sensitivity, it has some limitations. The NSR primers were carefully designed according to rRNA sequences in the specific organism (mouse), and designing new primer sets for other species would take considerable effort.\n\nBacteria and other prokaryotes are currently not amenable to single-cell RNA-seq due to the lack of polyadenylated mRNA. Thus, the development of single-cell RNA-seq methods that do not depend on poly(A) tail capture will also be instrumental in enabling single-cell resolution microbiome studies. Bulk bacterial studies typically apply general rRNA depletion to overcome the lack of polyadenylated mRNA on bacteria, but at the single-cell level, the total RNA found in one cell is too small.<ref

Reagents required for MDA reactions include: random primers and DNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi29. In 30 degree isothermal reaction, DNA is amplified with included reagents. As the [[polymerases]] manufacture new strands, a strand displacement reaction takes place, synthesizing multiple copies from each template DNA. At the same time, the strands that were extended antecedently will be displaced. MDA products result in a length of about 12 kb and ranges up to around 100 kb, enabling its use in DNA sequencing.<ref name=\"Lasken\" /> In 2017, a major improvement to this technique, called WGA-X, was introduced by taking advantage of a thermostable mutant of the phi29 polymerase, leading to better genome recovery from individual cells, in particular those with high G+C content.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stepanauskas R, Fergusson EA, Brown J, Poulton NJ, Tupper B, Labont\u00e9 JM, Becraft ED, Brown JM, Pachiadaki MG, Povilaitis T, Thompson BP, Mascena CJ, Bellows WK, Lubys A | display-authors = 6 | title = Improved genome recovery and integrated cell-size analyses of individual uncultured microbial cells and viral particles | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 84 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28729688 | pmc = 5519541 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-017-00128-z | bibcode = 2017NatCo...8...84S }}</ref> MDA has also been implemented in a microfluidic droplet-based system to achieve a highly parallelized single-cell whole genome amplification.

MDA could be more effective for identifying [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]], whereas MALBAC is preferred for detecting copy number variants. While performing MDA with a microfluidic device markedly reduces bias and contamination, the chemistry involved in MALBAC does not demonstrate the same potential for improved efficiency. The choice of method depends on the goal of the sequencing because each method presents different advantages.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Limitations ===\nMDA of individual cell genomes results in highly uneven genome coverage, i.e. relative overrepresentation and underrepresentation of various regions of the template, leading to loss of some sequences. There are two components to this process: a) stochastic over- and under-amplification of random regions; and b) systematic bias against high %GC regions. The stochastic component may be addressed by pooling single-cell MDA reactions from the same cell type, by employing [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) and/or post-sequencing confirmation.<ref name=\"Lasken\" /> The bias of MDA against high %GC regions can be addressed by using thermostable polymerases, such as in the process called WGA-X.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), which are a big part of genetic variation in the [[human genome]], and [[copy number variation]] (CNV), pose problems in single cell sequencing, as well as the limited amount of DNA extracted from a single cell. Due to scant amounts of DNA, accurate analysis of DNA poses problems even after amplification since coverage is low and is susceptible to errors. With MDA, average genome coverage is less than 80% and SNPs that are not covered by sequencing reads will be opted out. In addition, MDA shows a high ratio of [[allele]] dropout, not detecting alleles from heterozygous samples. Various SNP algorithms are currently in use but none are specific to single cell sequencing. MDA with CNV also poses the problem of identifying false CNVs that conceal the real CNVs. To solve this, when patterns can be generated from false CNVs, algorithms can detect and eradicate this noise to produce true variants.<ref name=\"Ning\">\"{{cite journal | vauthors = Ning L, Liu G, Li G, Hou Y, Tong Y, He J | title = Current challenges in the bioinformatics of single cell genomics | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 7 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24478987 | pmc = 3902584 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2014.00007 }}\"</ref>\n\n=== Applications ===\n[[Microbiome]]s are among the main targets of single cell genomics due to the difficulty of culturing the majority of microorganisms in most environments.

The final product library was then analyzed by microarray, with low bias and good coverage. However, RCA has not been tested with RNA-seq, which typically employs next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-seq for bacteria would be highly useful for studying microbiomes. It would address issues encountered in conventional bulk metatranscriptomics approaches, such as failing to capture species present in low abundance, and failing to resolve heterogeneity among cell populations.\n\nscRNA-Seq has provided considerable insight into the development of embryos and organisms, including the worm [[Caenorhabditis elegans]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao J, Packer JS, Ramani V, Cusanovich DA, Huynh C, Daza R, Qiu X, Lee C, Furlan SN, Steemers FJ, Adey A, Waterston RH, Trapnell C, Shendure J | display-authors = 6 | title = Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism | journal = Science | volume = 357 | issue = 6352 | pages = 661\u2013667 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28818938 | pmc = 5894354 | doi = 10.1126/science.aam8940 | bibcode = 2017Sci...357..661C }}</ref> and the regenerative planarian [[Schmidtea mediterranea]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Plass M, Solana J, Wolf FA, Ayoub S, Misios A, Gla\u017ear P, Obermayer B, Theis FJ, Kocks C, Rajewsky N | display-authors = 6 | title = Cell type atlas and lineage tree of a whole complex animal by single-cell transcriptomics | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6391 | pages = eaaq1723 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29674432 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaq1723 | url = https://push-zb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/frontdoor.php?source_opus=53439 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fincher CT, Wurtzel O, de Hoog T, Kravarik KM, Reddien PW | title = Schmidtea mediterranea | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6391 | pages = eaaq1736 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29674431 | pmc = 6563842 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaq1736 }}</ref> and axolotl [[Ambystoma mexicanum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Tobias|last2=Murawala|first2=Prayag|last3=Knapp|first3=Dunja|last4=Masselink|first4=Wouter|last5=Schuez|first5=Maritta|last6=Hermann|first6=Sarah|last7=Gac-Santel|first7=Malgorzata|last8=Nowoshilow|first8=Sergej|last9=Kageyama|first9=Jorge|last10=Khattak|first10=Shahryar|last11=Currie|first11=Joshua D.|date=2018-10-26|title=Single-cell analysis uncovers convergence of cell identities during axolotl limb regeneration|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/eaaq0681|journal=Science|language=en|volume=362|issue=6413|doi=10.1126/science.aaq0681|issn=0036-8075|pmid=30262634}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Nicholas D.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Garrett S.|last3=Johnson|first3=Kimberly|last4=Mariano|first4=Rachelle|last5=Oshiro|first5=Rachel|last6=Wong|first6=Alan Y.|last7=Bryant|first7=Donald M.|last8=Miller|first8=Bess M.|last9=Ratner|first9=Alex|last10=Chen|first10=Andy|last11=Ye|first11=William W.|date=2018-12-04|title=Transcriptomic landscape of the blastema niche in regenerating adult axolotl limbs at single-cell resolution|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07604-0|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-07604-0|issn=2041-1723}}</ref> The first vertebrate animals to be mapped in this way were [[Zebrafish]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner DE, Weinreb C, Collins ZM, Briggs JA, Megason SG, Klein AM | title = Single-cell mapping of gene expression landscapes and lineage in the zebrafish embryo | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6392 | pages = 981\u2013987 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29700229 | pmc = 6083445 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar4362 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..981W }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Farrell JA, Wang Y, Riesenfeld SJ, Shekhar K, Regev A, Schier AF | title = Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6392 | pages = eaar3131 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29700225 | pmc = 6247916 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar3131 }}</ref> and ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Briggs JA, Weinreb C, Wagner DE, Megason S, Peshkin L, Kirschner MW, Klein AM | title = The dynamics of gene expression in vertebrate embryogenesis at single-cell resolution | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6392 | pages = eaar5780 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29700227 | pmc = 6038144 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar5780 }}</ref> In each case multiple stages of the embryo were studied, allowing the entire process of development to be mapped on a cell-by-cell basis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> [[Science Magazine|Science]] recognized these advances as the 2018 [[Breakthrough of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2018/finalists/ |title=Science's 2018 Breakthrough of the Year: tracking development cell by cell|last=You|first=Jia | name-list-format = vanc | work = Science Magazine | publisher =  American Association for the Advancement of Science }}</ref>\n\n== Considerations ==\n\n=== Isolation of single cells ===\nThere are several ways to isolate individual cells prior to whole genome amplification and sequencing.

{"title_page": "Madura Mission", "text_new": "'''Madura Mission''' or '''Madurai Mission''' is a [[Jesuit]] mission in [[South India]] dating from the time of [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonisation]] in the province of Goa, comprising the west coast down to [[Calicut]] and the interior districts of the Deccan and Mysore, and that of [[Malabar region|Malabar]], being the area south of the peninsula encompassing the Malabar coast on the west, and the [[Coromandel coast]] on the east as far north as the River Vellar, including Cochin, Travancore, Madura, Tanjore, San Thome, and other contiguous districts. The term \"Madura Mission\" refers to that Jesuit missionary movement which had its starting point at [[Madurai|Madura]] and extended thence over the eastern half of the peninsula.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning and growth===\nMadura Mission owes its origin to [[Robert de Nobili]], who commenced at Madura, in 1606, that peculiar method of incorporating the local custom and traditions in evangelizing. Shortly afterwards Father Antony de Vico, and Father Manoel Martins began imitating his mode of life and working on the same lines with considerable success. Father Vico died in 1638 and was succeeded by Fr. Sebastian de Maya, who in 1640 was imprisoned at Madura in company with de Nobili, while Father Martins remained at Trichy. In 1640 a new departure was made by Father Balthasar da Costa who began working specially for the lower castes. The success was such that in 1644 the total number of converts in the Madura, Trichy, and Satiamangalam districts rose to 3500, that is to say 1000 of the higher castes, and 2500 pariahs. At that time there were five priests working on the mission. Subsequent progress was still more gratifying, for in 1680 the number of converts altogether was reckoned at no less than 80,000. The number of workers, however, did not increase in proportion; they generally amounted to seven to ten, and only as late as 1746 reached to fourteen. Among these the most successful were Father Balthasar da Costa and Manoel Martins already mentioned, Andrew Freyre, Bl. [[John de Britto]], Francis Laynes, Venance Bouchet, Peter Martin, and [[Constanzo Beschi|Father Beschi]].\n\n===End and Succeeding missions===\n[[History of Portugal (1640\u20131777)#Expulsion of the Jesuits|The expulsion of the Jesuit Order from Portuguese territory]] in the year 1759 put an immediate check on the supply of missionaries, but the fathers already in the mission, being outside the Portuguese dominions, were able to continue their work though with diminishing numbers. The entire [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Order]] in 1773, however, brought the Jesuit regime to an end. Three years later (1776) a new [[Karnatic Mission|mission of the Karnatic]] was established by the Holy See, under the Paris Seminary for Foreign Missions, which, taking Pondicherry as its center, gradually extended its labors inwards as far as Mysore, and to the old Madura Mission. Under the Foreign Mission Society the remaining Jesuit Fathers continued to work till they gradually died out. Not much in the way of missionary work was done by the Goan clergy, who took the place of the Jesuits in certain stations, and the results previously gained were in prospect of being almost totally lost.\n\nIn the year 1836 the Karnatic mission was erected into the Vicariate Apostolic of the Coromandel Coast; and as the, Foreign Mission Society could not for want of men come to the rescue of Madura, they willingly accepted the appointment of the Jesuits in the same year - the Society having been restored in 1814. In 1846 the Madura Mission was in turn made into a vicariate Apostolic with Jesuit Msgr. [[Alexis Canoz]] as its first vicar Apostolic; but the portion north of the Cauvery was retained by Pondicherry.

The term \"Madura Mission\" refers to that Jesuit missionary movement which had its starting point at [[Madurai|Madura]] and extended thence over the eastern half of the peninsula.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning and growth===\nMadura Mission owes its origin to [[Robert de Nobili]], who commenced at Madura, in 1606, that peculiar method of incorporating the local custom and traditions in evangelizing. Shortly afterwards Father Antony de Vico, and Father Manoel Martins began imitating his mode of life and working on the same lines with considerable success. Father Vico died in 1638 and was succeeded by Fr. Sebastian de Maya, who in 1640 was imprisoned at Madura in company with de Nobili, while Father Martins remained at Trichy. In 1640 a new departure was made by Father Balthasar da Costa who began working specially for the lower castes. The success was such that in 1644 the total number of converts in the Madura, Trichy, and Satiamangalam districts rose to 3500, that is to say 1000 of the higher castes, and 2500 pariahs. At that time there were five priests working on the mission. Subsequent progress was still more gratifying, for in 1680 the number of converts altogether was reckoned at no less than 80,000. The number of workers, however, did not increase in proportion; they generally amounted to seven to ten, and only as late as 1746 reached to fourteen. Among these the most successful were Father Balthasar da Costa and Manoel Martins already mentioned, Andrew Freyre, Bl. [[John de Britto]], Francis Laynes, Venance Bouchet, Peter Martin, and [[Constanzo Beschi|Father Beschi]].\n\n===End and Succeeding missions===\n[[History of Portugal (1640\u20131777)#Expulsion of the Jesuits|The expulsion of the Jesuit Order from Portuguese territory]] in the year 1759 put an immediate check on the supply of missionaries, but the fathers already in the mission, being outside the Portuguese dominions, were able to continue their work though with diminishing numbers. The entire [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Order]] in 1773, however, brought the Jesuit regime to an end. Three years later (1776) a new [[Karnatic Mission|mission of the Karnatic]] was established by the Holy See, under the Paris Seminary for Foreign Missions, which, taking Pondicherry as its center, gradually extended its labors inwards as far as Mysore, and to the old Madura Mission. Under the Foreign Mission Society the remaining Jesuit Fathers continued to work till they gradually died out. Not much in the way of missionary work was done by the Goan clergy, who took the place of the Jesuits in certain stations, and the results previously gained were in prospect of being almost totally lost.\n\nIn the year 1836 the Karnatic mission was erected into the Vicariate Apostolic of the Coromandel Coast; and as the, Foreign Mission Society could not for want of men come to the rescue of Madura, they willingly accepted the appointment of the Jesuits in the same year - the Society having been restored in 1814. In 1846 the Madura Mission was in turn made into a vicariate Apostolic with Jesuit Msgr. [[Alexis Canoz]] as its first vicar Apostolic; but the portion north of the Cauvery was retained by Pondicherry. In 1886, on the establishment of the hierarchy, the Madura Vicariate was made the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tiruchirapalli|Diocese of Trichy]]. In 1893 Tanjore was taken away and given to the Padroado Diocese of Mylapore. In the same year the Trichy Diocese was finally made suffragan to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Bombay]].\n\n==References== \n{{Catholic|wstitle=Madura Mission}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=Syncretism/Anti-Syncretism: The Politics of Religious Synthesis |editor1-first=Rosalind |editor1-last=Shaw |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Stewart |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-13483-395-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-IKJAgAAQBAJ}}\n*{{cite book |title=Mission and Tamil Society: Social and Religious Change in South India (1840-1900) |first=Henriette |last=Bugge |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-70070-292-3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_YhcGxvZvNEC}}\n*{{cite book |title=Jesuit Survival and Restoration: A Global History, 1773-1900 |first1=Robert Aleksander |last1=Maryks |first2=Jonathan |last2=Wright |edition=Reprinted, revised |publisher=BRILL |year=2014 |isbn=978-9-00428-387-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qnajBQAAQBAJ}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Saint in the Banyan Tree: Christianity and Caste Society in India |first=David |last=Mosse |publisher=University of California Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-52027-349-8 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OaG0mVMPO2gC}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Visitor: Andre Palmeiro and the Jesuits in Asia |first=Liam Matthew |last=Brockey |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-67441-668-0 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7v6EBAAAQBAJ}}\n*{{cite book |title=Mapping Hinduism: 'Hinduism' and the Study of Indian Religions, 1600-1776 |first=Will |last=Sweetman |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-93147-949-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yCXSPEage98C}}\n\n{{RC Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore}}\n\n[[Category:Jesuit Asia missions]]\n[[Category:Christian missions in India]]\n[[Category:Madurai]]\n", "name_user": "Kkavita", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected the link to Portuguese in India", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madura_Mission"}
