Woods]], an inventor in electrical and mechanical engineering with more than 50 patents, only went to school until he was ten years old. Learning on the job, he began as a blacksmith's apprentice and continued as a machinist, an electrician, a railroad fireman, a locomotive and steamship engineer. In his free time, he kept reading, especially on the subjects of electricity and mechanics. During the 1860s and 1870s, because he was black, he was not allowed to borrow books from the local libraries so he would ask white friends to borrow them for him. Every time he saw a new piece of technology, he would ask questions about it. Years later, in an 1886 cross-examination for a patent dispute, he said that he was self-taught.<ref>Prof. Rayvon Fouch\u00e9, \"Liars and Thieves : Granville T.

The southern terminus within Massachusetts exists in [[Millville, Massachusetts|Millville]], where the expressway enters the state from [[North Smithfield, Rhode Island]]. Among several local roads, Route 146 intersects with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90) in [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] before arriving at its northern terminus at the intersection of several surface streets in downtown Worcester.

MA 146 was built between 1949 and 1952 as a four-lane divided roadway from US 20 in [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] to Boston Road in [[Sutton, Massachusetts|Sutton]], and from Sutton south to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, Route 146 was built as a three-lane undivided roadway, providing one lane in each direction and a shared lane in the center.\n\nIn 1981, the MassDPW began work on rebuilding Route 146. During the next three years, the state rebuilt the {{convert|13.1|mile|km|adj=mid|-long}} section from just south of Boston Road in Sutton to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, replacing the three-lane undivided section with a four-lane freeway and eliminating all at-grade intersections and curb cuts.\n\nThe project upgrading the section linking Exit 10A on the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] north into downtown Worcester at Brosnihan Square to [[Interstate Highway standards]] was completed in November 2007 according to the State Highway Administration.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason=No agency of this name in Massachusetts}} The improvements to the road created an economic boon to the [[Blackstone Valley]] through which it passes.

The US Navy saw the vital importance of being able to build their own port facilities and to deploy naval construction units trained and dedicated for just that role.  Creating the Seabees addressed that issue.  Four battalions were tasked as pontoon battalions and four Pontoon Assembly Detachments (PADs) were formed. The US Army soon followed with their own units.\n\n==Construction==\nThe NLPs were constructed of welded steel flotation units that were assembled like Legos, connected by special angle-iron pieces, called stringers. The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation boxes came in two types: a rectangular basic unit measuring {{convert|5|x|5|x|7|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type had one side that was curved or angled to make a [[Bow (ship)|bow]]s on the front of NLP barges or a ramp as needed.\n\n== References ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2yADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Navy+Lighterage+pontoons+%22Popular+Science%22&source=bl&ots=vr4VNSb0aj&sig=TaBq1w96Z-QkTHfMtV6ZTSiFuBM&hl=en&ei=wDjmTPGhKdnhnQehyMT2DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Navy's pin-up Boxes\", February 1946, Popular Science] illustrations of NPL units\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/nl.htm \"Navy Lighterage\", ''Global Security'']\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rhino ferry]]\n\n[[Category:World War II military equipment of the United States]]\n[[Category:Military bridging equipment]]\n[[Category:Pontoon bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Coastal construction]]\n[[Category:Amphibious warfare]]\n[[Category:Logistics]]\n", "name_user": "Mcb133aco", "label": "safe", "comment": "added reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_lighterage_pontoon"}

Vembo continued to perform \"Horiata\" in her concerts in the Middle East and continued to inspire the [[Greek resistance]] movement.

It has partnered with leading institutions in six countries to provide students with global expertise. UPES graduate students get 50% waiver on PG programs tuition fees in over 22 UPES partner institutions in [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Canada]] ([[Vancouver]] or [[Toronto]]), [[Singapore]] and [[Dublin]]. Another exciting added advantage is that all UPES students enrolling in the year 2020 can study overseas for four weeks in partner institutions, without any additional tuition fee. The 4-week study abroad program is to give students exposure to global experts, culture, and situations. Students stand to benefit from lectures and seminars by expert faculty, notable guest speakers connected to industry and leading professional practitioners in their field, practical group work and exercises fostering inspiration through participation and making and visits to relevant industry and design studios. \n\nMoreover, UPES is the only university to roll out a plethora of offerings for building life-long connections with its alumni. Under its '''UCONNECT''' program, all alumni get placement support for up to five years, post their graduation from UPES. Support also comes in the form of incubation and funding up to Rs.10 lakh and workspace support in key cities. Alumni also have the advantage of a 35 per cent scholarship on tuition fees for post-graduation at academic partner institutes abroad.\n\n<br />\n\n== Location ==\nUPES is situated in the safe and scenic environs of [[Dehradun]], the capital of the state of [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]].

This chapter educates the students of UPES about cloud.\n* CSI<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/upescsi/|title=UPES CSI STUDENT CHAPTER (@upescsi) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> ([[Computer Society of India]]) ISSA Dehradun Chapter- With the burning desire and enthusiasm to be different from the crowd, UPES-CSI Student Chapter was established in the year 2010 and is one of the most active chapters of UPES.

A full-time psychological [[School counselor|counselor]] adopts a holistic approach and includes all domains of student\u2019s life while providing group and one to one counseling. Difficulties in academics and learning are dealt with through faculty mentors. UPES is among one of the few universities that understand the student's need for a friend, guide, role model and mentor. The department of Student Engagement and Experience works closely with students to ensure a wide range of initiatives and activities for engaging them throughout the academic year.\n\n=== '''HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES''' ===\nThe University provides the students a well-equipped [[First aid|first-aid]] support in the [[Hospital|Infirmary]], It\u2019s also equipped with [[ambulance]] evacuation for the students.

At the time of admission, students are offered fee-relaxation based on their Class X and XII marks. It continues further based on marks scored by the students in their semester examination. The university has extended financial support to the students who are unable to pay the tuition fee on account of having lost any of the earning parents after their enrollment in UPES. Fee waiver is extended to [[Uttarakhand]] domicile students. Starting 2020, UPES has introduced a special scheme to promote higher education for girls by extending a 25% scholarship on their tuition fees for the complete program duration. \n\n=== '''REMEDIAL COACHING''' ===\nUnderstanding the importance of supporting the students to overcome their learning difficulties and gain confidence and interest in learning, remedial classes are planned and organised each year. The [[remedial education|remedial]] classes are conducted for the students whose performance is not up to the mark, i.e., for the students who secure less than 40% marks in Mid-Term Examination. These classes help the slow learners to fill the gaps in the teaching learning process which may be due to their slow learning pace, lack of understanding, lack of motivation to practice the problems etc. and ultimately enhance their learnings and skills, resulting in [[improvement]] in their [[performance]].\n\n=== SPORTS ACTIVITIES ===\nAt UPES, students are encouraged to focus on physical fitness and sports. Students participate and excel in a variety of games and sports that are organised at regular intervals in the university \u2013 UPES Annual Athletics Meet, Intra Mural Tournaments (All Sports), Inter-University Participation, Yoga and Meditation and Khel Utsav \u2013 UPES Sports Festival.\n\n=== CULTURAL ACTIVITIES ===\nThe cultural committee provides numerous opportunities for students to get involved, have fun, showcase their talents, and compete against other colleges in a variety of competitions. UPES under the aegis of Office of Student Engagement and Experience organises Freshers\u2019 Party and the '''Annual Cultural Festival \u2013 Uurja,'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/upes.uurja/|title=Uurja (@upes.uurja) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> '''which gives a platform to students to showcase their talents.'''

This is planned to break the monotonous routine by providing students a platform to showcase their talent.\n\n=== NATIONAL SERVICE SCHEME ===\nThe [[National Service Scheme]] (NSS) has been in operation in UPES since April 2018. The fundamental objective of the NSS is to awaken and enrich the social consciousness of students. The scheme provides an opportunity for students to engage in constructive social action, programs, develop co-operative team spirit and gain skills in democratic leadership quality.\n\nStudent of UPES are the primary beneficiary of the program by way of development of their perception about the community, their skill in performing specific jobs, and in developing the qualities of a leader, an organiser, and an administrator and the overall development of their personality as a whole. Through NSS, they get opportunities to see the community closely and thus get an experience of human nature in relation to their environment. This is how the NSS program aims to make the NSS student youth better citizens through \u2018Development of their Personality through Community Service\u2019. Caring for the environment and people around is fundamental to all activities at UPES. University has adopted several schools in villages and suburbs to impart primary and higher education and computer literacy. Students continuously participate in [[Plantation|tree plantation]] drives, [[donation]] drives, [[rainwater harvesting]], [[Swachh Bharat Mission|Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan]], and [[Women's empowerment|Women\u2019s Empowerment]].\n\n== Innovation & Entrepreneurship ==\n\n=== UPES CENTRE FOR INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upes.ac.in/ucie|title=UPES Centre For Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE)|website=www.upes.ac.in|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> ===\nThe UPES Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE) is a Business Incubator (BI) with focus on the technology sectors in [[National Capital Region (India)|Delhi NCR]] and [[Uttarakhand]] region belt. The mandate of the Centre is to assist the UPES community entrepreneurs (faculty, staff, alumni and students) as well as the external community entrepreneurs, commercialise their product/service ideas and/or accelerate their growth. The mission is to synchronize and synergize the interactions between various stakeholders of [[Entrepreneurship]] [[Ecosystem]] with utmost importance on enabling young students to become successful. The key technology focus areas are: [[Transport|Transportation]], [[Infrastructure]], [[E-commerce]], [[Education]], [[Energy]], [[Information technology|IT]]/ITES Gaming and [[Animation]], [[Cloud computing|Cloud Computing]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy technology|Energy Technology]], [[Food Processing Technology Building|Food Processing Technology]], Retail Technology and [[Fashion design|Fashion Technology.]] \n\nUCIE believes in providing a platform to enthusiastic, zealous, and aspiring entrepreneurs and in bringing a positive change in the industry with launch of new and promising businesses. It encourages talent and innovative thinking and provides opportunities to the potential change makers of the industry, thereby contributing towards bringing about a positive change. UCIE supports technology start-ups as well as lab-stage innovations and paves the path for potential business ideas to reach the market.\n\n=== '''UCIE ASSOCIATION WITH UNIVERSITY BUSINESS INCUBATOR (UBI) GLOBAL''' ===\nUCIE is a member of UBI Global, this provides the centre a unique opportunity to understand, explore and visualize the state and impact of India's incubation ecosystem in a more efficient way. This also helps in sharing global incubation best practices and insights and nurtures a network within Centre\u2019s own ecosystem. UCIE primarily works with focus on following three parameters and their sub-constituents to improve and evaluate operational and strategic effectiveness.\n\n=== '''UCIE PARTNERS''' ===\nUCIE aims to build an Entrepreneurial ecosystem in [[Uttarakhand]] to strengthen the existing stakeholders by providing them a network to share/discuss/leverage areas of common interest. This would invariably result in valuable help in a short period of time there by economic cooperation in the future. UCIE conducts a series of events with network of local community, Departments of State Government, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] (CII), [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry]] (FICCI), PHD Chamber of Commerce by providing information about UCIE and its activities to build mutually enriching cooperation and growth of entrepreneurship in Uttarakhand region.

The workshops developed by the Centre are framed around businesses and involve academic researchers and professionals from the industry. The workshops are organized to provide a basic understanding of what it takes to commercialize and gain various types of business knowledge. Supported by the faculty of UPES and industry experts, these workshops cover a wide variety of topics viz. industry analysis, technical feasibility study, market feasibility, demand forecasting, financial feasibility study, and strategy development. The theoretical knowledge is enhanced by the industry experts and entrepreneurs who also share their personal experiences with the candidates.\n\n== CSR Initiatives at UPES ==\n\n==== '''Project Abhilasha''' ====\nChildren are often deprived of education due to inequalities that emanate from socio-economic status, gender and cultural identities. The idea behind this project is to identify meritorious students from the marginalized regions of the state and invite them for a month-long residential coaching camp on the campus. The focus is on strengthening their grasp of subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Maths, thereby making them ready for engineering entrance exams.\n\n==== '''Project Vikalp''' ====\nRural Women Technology Park has been involved in empowerment activities for the women of neighbouring villages surrounding the university campus since 2015. The project supports initiatives related to recycled paper products; ICT-assisted art and craft design; and identification and cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plant species. Additionally, these budding entrepreneurs receive assistance from experts on the campus for the marketing of their products.\n\n==== '''Project Payal''' ====\nProviding education for girls is, arguably, one of the best development investments an organization can make. And that is precisely what Project Payal has set out to achieve. Supporting underprivileged meritorious girls from neighbouring villages, the project makes sure there is an overall development in their personality.\n\n==== '''Project Uthaan''' ====\nSmart Village is fast becoming a buzzword in policy and rural development discussions. This project aims to transform Dhalani and Koti into model smart villages, with special focus on healthcare, education and livelihood. These will be first of many villages to reap the benefits of this program, bringing more development and prosperity to the Indian rural landscape.\n\n==== '''Project Vriddhi''' ====\nEvery child deserves to reach her or his full potential. And education is one of the best predictors of success in children. It can help break the inter-generational cycles of poverty and marginalization. This project aims to provide the desired level of education in English and Mathematics to primary school students. It is helmed by the UPES faculty as mentors and supported by student volunteers.\n\n==== '''Project Samvedna''' ====\nConstruction projects are a tall order and usually require people with varied skill sets to execute it. Workers are typically hired to spend months or even years on any one project. At our campus, too, there are numerous construction projects, thus making it a transit home for\n\nhundreds of workers. This project is aimed at the children of these workers. It provides them with education, day-care, mid-day meals, medical checkups, clothing, etc., through a day school set-up at the campuses.\n\n==== '''Project Bodh''' ====\nEveryone sees the world through their own prism. This project recognizes the fact that all children have their own perception of the world. These are images that are strongly shaped by their individual imagination and experiences. On the occasion of the World Book Day, five students from government primary schools, along with their teachers and principals, participated in a painting competition on the theme of \u2018environment\u2019. The winners took home trophies, while all participants got a bag, books and stationery as gifts.\n\n==== '''Shaheed Memorial Cricket Tournament''' ====\nThe Annual T-20 Shaheed Memorial Cricket Tournament is a way to pay homage to the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. The 2019 Tournament was organized in the memory of Vir Chakra (Posthumous) Awardee Naik Brij Mohan Singh from 9 Para (SF), a young soldier from Village Tunwala in Dehradun who went down fighting during the Kargil War on July 1, 1999.\n\n==== '''Project Protsaahan''' ====\nOne of the biggest reasons students drop out of college is because of lack of funds to keep going. This project supports meritorious underprivileged students of PYDS Academy of Learning, Purukul \u2013 Dehradun, for their higher education beyond Class XII. It admits two students annually from PYDS \u2013 one boy and one girl \u2013 who qualify the UPES Entrance Examination, into any of its programs and gives annual cumulative academic scholarship of Rs.20 lakh.\n\n==== '''Project Swachhta''' ====\nAligned with the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission to clean up streets, roads and public spaces in the cities, towns, urban and rural areas, Project Swachhta has evoked a sense of responsibility among the residents of Dehradun too. Cleanliness drives are being conducted at regular interval in areas adjoining the campus. The local residents have also been sensitized to join the program. The aim is to instill the value of cleanliness among youth through voluntary work in order to take the cleanliness drive to the next level.\n\n==== '''Project Samarth''' ====\nTechnology is shaping today\u2019s students and their learning. Hence it is imperative to arm them with a set of competencies that allows them to function and participate fully in a digital world. Project Samarth was envisioned with the sole purpose of providing technological support to the Shrimad Dayanand Arsh Jyotirmath, Gurukul. It equips their students with IT skills, covering their computer studies syllabus and imparting basic computer operational skills to their teachers.\n\n==== '''Project Raftaar''' ====\nWhile academics play a significant role, extra-curricular activities are also important in shaping the personality and character of a student. Children who dabble in these activities are known to display a heightened sense of discipline, concentration, and time-management. Project Raftaar aims at personality development of students in eight government primary schools through sports and cultural activities. An annual inter-school competition with over 300 participants, the event provides the students a platform to compete amongst themselves. \n\n==See also==\n* [[University of Technology and Management]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee]]\n* [[List of universities in India]]\n* [[List of business schools in Asia]]\n* [[University Grants Commission (India)]]\n\n==References==\nEligibility, Application Form, Admit Card Etc.<ref>[https://university.careers360.com/articles/upes-admission UPES Admission Process]</ref>\nHow to Apply for UPES application Form<ref>[https://university.careers360.com/articles/upes-application-form UPES Application Form Procedure]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official}}\n\n{{Dehradun}}\n{{Universities in Uttarakhand}}\n{{Colleges Under HERS}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:University of Petroleum and Energy Studies}}\n[[Category:Universities in Uttarakhand]]\n[[Category:Law schools in India]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Dehradun]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Dehradun]]\n[[Category:Petroleum engineering schools]]\n[[Category:Institutions of Petroleum in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian University}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Primary sources|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox university\n|name           = University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES) \n|image_name     = \n|motto          = \n|mottoeng       = University with a purpose\n|established    = 2003\n|chancellor     = Dr. S J Chopra\n|vice_chancellor= Dr. Sunil Rai\n|undergrad      = \n|city           = [[Bidholi]], Via Prem Nagar, [[Dehradun]]\n|state          = [[Uttarakhand]]\n|country        = India\n|students       =\n|free_label     = \n|free           = \n|type           = Private University<ref name=\"upes.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upes.ac.in/accreditations-recognitions|title=Accreditations & Recognitions|website=www.upes.ac.in |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119091256/http://www.upes.ac.in/accreditations-recognitions |archivedate=19 November 2013 }}</ref>\n|campus         = [[Suburb]]an,{{convert|42|acre|ft2}}\n|affiliations   = [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]], [[National Assessment and Accreditation Council|NAAC]], [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (India)|DSIR]], [[IGNOU]], [[Association of Indian Universities|AIU]], [[International Association of Universities|IAU]], [[Bar Council of India|BCI]]<ref name=\"upes.ac.in\"/>\n|website        = {{URL|http://www.upes.ac.in/}}\n|coor           ={{Coord|30|24|57.38|N|77|58|1.24|E|display=inline, title}}\n|logo= \n}}\nThe '''[[University of Petroleum and Energy Studies]]''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upes.ac.in/|title=UPES University in Dehradun For Admission in MBA, LLB, B.tech, M.tech|website=www.upes.ac.in|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>'''([https://www.upes.ac.in/ UPES]'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upes.ac.in/|title=UPES University in Dehradun For Admission in MBA, LLB, B.tech, M.tech|website=www.upes.ac.in|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>''')''' was established in 2003 through the UPES Act, 2003, of the State Legislature of Uttarakhand.

A full-time psychological [[School counselor|counselor]] adopts a holistic approach and includes all domains of student\u2019s life while providing group and one to one counseling. Difficulties in academics and learning are dealt with through faculty mentors. UPES is among one of the few universities that understand the student's need for a friend, guide, role model and mentor. The department of Student Engagement and Experience works closely with students to ensure a wide range of initiatives and activities for engaging them throughout the academic year.\n\n=== '''HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES''' ===\nThe University provides the students a well-equipped [[First aid|first-aid]] support in the [[Hospital|Infirmary]], It\u2019s also equipped with [[ambulance]] evacuation for the students.

All the registered students in UPES are medically insured for a sum of INR 100,000. The insurance also covers road accident causality.\n\n=== '''FINANCIAL SUPPORT''' ===\nUPES extends financial support to the registered students on merit and means. At the time of admission, students are offered fee-relaxation based on their Class X and XII marks. It continues further based on marks scored by the students in their semester examination. The university has extended financial support to the students who are unable to pay the tuition fee on account of having lost any of the earning parents after their enrollment in UPES. Fee waiver is extended to [[Uttarakhand]] domicile students. Starting 2020, UPES has introduced a special scheme to promote higher education for girls by extending a 25% scholarship on their tuition fees for the complete program duration. \n\n=== '''REMEDIAL COACHING''' ===\nUnderstanding the importance of supporting the students to overcome their learning difficulties and gain confidence and interest in learning, remedial classes are planned and organised each year. The [[remedial education|remedial]] classes are conducted for the students whose performance is not up to the mark, i.e., for the students who secure less than 40% marks in Mid-Term Examination. These classes help the slow learners to fill the gaps in the teaching learning process which may be due to their slow learning pace, lack of understanding, lack of motivation to practice the problems etc. and ultimately enhance their learnings and skills, resulting in [[improvement]] in their [[performance]].\n\n=== SPORTS ACTIVITIES ===\nAt UPES, students are encouraged to focus on physical fitness and sports. Students participate and excel in a variety of games and sports that are organised at regular intervals in the university \u2013 UPES Annual Athletics Meet, Intra Mural Tournaments (All Sports), Inter-University Participation, Yoga and Meditation and Khel Utsav \u2013 UPES Sports Festival.\n\n=== CULTURAL ACTIVITIES ===\nThe cultural committee provides numerous opportunities for students to get involved, have fun, showcase their talents, and compete against other colleges in a variety of competitions. UPES under the aegis of Office of Student Engagement and Experience organises Freshers\u2019 Party and the '''Annual Cultural Festival \u2013 Uurja,'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/upes.uurja/|title=Uurja (@upes.uurja) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> '''which gives a platform to students to showcase their talents.''' Freshers\u2019 parties, to officially welcome the first-year students, are hosted by second-year students, organised by School Cultural Convener under the supervision of the office of Student Engagement and Experience. Uurja is the annual cultural festival and is celebrated for two days at UPES Campus. Wow Wednesdays is a mid-week activity that allows students to unwind. This is planned to break the monotonous routine by providing students a platform to showcase their talent.\n\n=== NATIONAL SERVICE SCHEME ===\nThe [[National Service Scheme]] (NSS) has been in operation in UPES since April 2018. The fundamental objective of the NSS is to awaken and enrich the social consciousness of students. The scheme provides an opportunity for students to engage in constructive social action, programs, develop co-operative team spirit and gain skills in democratic leadership quality.\n\nStudent of UPES are the primary beneficiary of the program by way of development of their perception about the community, their skill in performing specific jobs, and in developing the qualities of a leader, an organiser, and an administrator and the overall development of their personality as a whole. Through NSS, they get opportunities to see the community closely and thus get an experience of human nature in relation to their environment. This is how the NSS program aims to make the NSS student youth better citizens through \u2018Development of their Personality through Community Service\u2019. Caring for the environment and people around is fundamental to all activities at UPES. University has adopted several schools in villages and suburbs to impart primary and higher education and computer literacy. Students continuously participate in [[Plantation|tree plantation]] drives, [[donation]] drives, [[rainwater harvesting]], [[Swachh Bharat Mission|Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan]], and [[Women's empowerment|Women\u2019s Empowerment]].\n\n== Innovation & Entrepreneurship ==\n\n=== UPES CENTRE FOR INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upes.ac.in/ucie|title=UPES Centre For Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE)|website=www.upes.ac.in|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> ===\nThe UPES Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE) is a Business Incubator (BI) with focus on the technology sectors in [[National Capital Region (India)|Delhi NCR]] and [[Uttarakhand]] region belt. The mandate of the Centre is to assist the UPES community entrepreneurs (faculty, staff, alumni and students) as well as the external community entrepreneurs, commercialise their product/service ideas and/or accelerate their growth. The mission is to synchronize and synergize the interactions between various stakeholders of [[Entrepreneurship]] [[Ecosystem]] with utmost importance on enabling young students to become successful. The key technology focus areas are: [[Transport|Transportation]], [[Infrastructure]], [[E-commerce]], [[Education]], [[Energy]], [[Information technology|IT]]/ITES Gaming and [[Animation]], [[Cloud computing|Cloud Computing]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy technology|Energy Technology]], [[Food Processing Technology Building|Food Processing Technology]], Retail Technology and [[Fashion design|Fashion Technology.]] \n\nUCIE believes in providing a platform to enthusiastic, zealous, and aspiring entrepreneurs and in bringing a positive change in the industry with launch of new and promising businesses.

UCIE supports technology start-ups as well as lab-stage innovations and paves the path for potential business ideas to reach the market.\n\n=== '''UCIE ASSOCIATION WITH UNIVERSITY BUSINESS INCUBATOR (UBI) GLOBAL''' ===\nUCIE is a member of UBI Global, this provides the centre a unique opportunity to understand, explore and visualize the state and impact of India's incubation ecosystem in a more efficient way. This also helps in sharing global incubation best practices and insights and nurtures a network within Centre\u2019s own ecosystem. UCIE primarily works with focus on following three parameters and their sub-constituents to improve and evaluate operational and strategic effectiveness.\n\n=== '''UCIE PARTNERS''' ===\nUCIE aims to build an Entrepreneurial ecosystem in [[Uttarakhand]] to strengthen the existing stakeholders by providing them a network to share/discuss/leverage areas of common interest. This would invariably result in valuable help in a short period of time there by economic cooperation in the future. UCIE conducts a series of events with network of local community, Departments of State Government, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] (CII), [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry]] (FICCI), PHD Chamber of Commerce by providing information about UCIE and its activities to build mutually enriching cooperation and growth of entrepreneurship in Uttarakhand region.

The workshops developed by the Centre are framed around businesses and involve academic researchers and professionals from the industry. The workshops are organized to provide a basic understanding of what it takes to commercialize and gain various types of business knowledge. Supported by the faculty of UPES and industry experts, these workshops cover a wide variety of topics viz. industry analysis, technical feasibility study, market feasibility, demand forecasting, financial feasibility study, and strategy development. The theoretical knowledge is enhanced by the industry experts and entrepreneurs who also share their personal experiences with the candidates.\n\n== CSR Initiatives at UPES ==\n\n==== '''Project Abhilasha''' ====\nChildren are often deprived of education due to inequalities that emanate from socio-economic status, gender and cultural identities. The idea behind this project is to identify meritorious students from the marginalized regions of the state and invite them for a month-long residential coaching camp on the campus. The focus is on strengthening their grasp of subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Maths, thereby making them ready for engineering entrance exams.\n\n==== '''Project Vikalp''' ====\nRural Women Technology Park has been involved in empowerment activities for the women of neighbouring villages surrounding the university campus since 2015. The project supports initiatives related to recycled paper products; ICT-assisted art and craft design; and identification and cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plant species. Additionally, these budding entrepreneurs receive assistance from experts on the campus for the marketing of their products.\n\n==== '''Project Payal''' ====\nProviding education for girls is, arguably, one of the best development investments an organization can make. And that is precisely what Project Payal has set out to achieve. Supporting underprivileged meritorious girls from neighbouring villages, the project makes sure there is an overall development in their personality.\n\n==== '''Project Uthaan''' ====\nSmart Village is fast becoming a buzzword in policy and rural development discussions. This project aims to transform Dhalani and Koti into model smart villages, with special focus on healthcare, education and livelihood. These will be first of many villages to reap the benefits of this program, bringing more development and prosperity to the Indian rural landscape.\n\n==== '''Project Vriddhi''' ====\nEvery child deserves to reach her or his full potential. And education is one of the best predictors of success in children. It can help break the inter-generational cycles of poverty and marginalization. This project aims to provide the desired level of education in English and Mathematics to primary school students. It is helmed by the UPES faculty as mentors and supported by student volunteers.\n\n==== '''Project Samvedna''' ====\nConstruction projects are a tall order and usually require people with varied skill sets to execute it. Workers are typically hired to spend months or even years on any one project. At our campus, too, there are numerous construction projects, thus making it a transit home for\n\nhundreds of workers. This project is aimed at the children of these workers. It provides them with education, day-care, mid-day meals, medical checkups, clothing, etc., through a day school set-up at the campuses.\n\n==== '''Project Bodh''' ====\nEveryone sees the world through their own prism. This project recognizes the fact that all children have their own perception of the world. These are images that are strongly shaped by their individual imagination and experiences. On the occasion of the World Book Day, five students from government primary schools, along with their teachers and principals, participated in a painting competition on the theme of \u2018environment\u2019. The winners took home trophies, while all participants got a bag, books and stationery as gifts.\n\n==== '''Shaheed Memorial Cricket Tournament''' ====\nThe Annual T-20 Shaheed Memorial Cricket Tournament is a way to pay homage to the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. The 2019 Tournament was organized in the memory of Vir Chakra (Posthumous) Awardee Naik Brij Mohan Singh from 9 Para (SF), a young soldier from Village Tunwala in Dehradun who went down fighting during the Kargil War on July 1, 1999.\n\n==== '''Project Protsaahan''' ====\nOne of the biggest reasons students drop out of college is because of lack of funds to keep going. This project supports meritorious underprivileged students of PYDS Academy of Learning, Purukul \u2013 Dehradun, for their higher education beyond Class XII. It admits two students annually from PYDS \u2013 one boy and one girl \u2013 who qualify the UPES Entrance Examination, into any of its programs and gives annual cumulative academic scholarship of Rs.20 lakh.\n\n==== '''Project Swachhta''' ====\nAligned with the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission to clean up streets, roads and public spaces in the cities, towns, urban and rural areas, Project Swachhta has evoked a sense of responsibility among the residents of Dehradun too. Cleanliness drives are being conducted at regular interval in areas adjoining the campus. The local residents have also been sensitized to join the program. The aim is to instill the value of cleanliness among youth through voluntary work in order to take the cleanliness drive to the next level.\n\n==== '''Project Samarth''' ====\nTechnology is shaping today\u2019s students and their learning. Hence it is imperative to arm them with a set of competencies that allows them to function and participate fully in a digital world. Project Samarth was envisioned with the sole purpose of providing technological support to the Shrimad Dayanand Arsh Jyotirmath, Gurukul. It equips their students with IT skills, covering their computer studies syllabus and imparting basic computer operational skills to their teachers.\n\n==== '''Project Raftaar''' ====\nWhile academics play a significant role, extra-curricular activities are also important in shaping the personality and character of a student. Children who dabble in these activities are known to display a heightened sense of discipline, concentration, and time-management. Project Raftaar aims at personality development of students in eight government primary schools through sports and cultural activities. An annual inter-school competition with over 300 participants, the event provides the students a platform to compete amongst themselves. \n\n==See also==\n* [[University of Technology and Management]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee]]\n* [[List of universities in India]]\n* [[List of business schools in Asia]]\n* [[University Grants Commission (India)]]\n\n==References==\nEligibility, Application Form, Admit Card Etc.<ref>[https://university.careers360.com/articles/upes-admission UPES Admission Process]</ref>\nHow to Apply for UPES application Form<ref>[https://university.careers360.com/articles/upes-application-form UPES Application Form Procedure]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official}}\n\n{{Dehradun}}\n{{Universities in Uttarakhand}}\n{{Colleges Under HERS}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:University of Petroleum and Energy Studies}}\n[[Category:Universities in Uttarakhand]]\n[[Category:Law schools in India]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Dehradun]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Dehradun]]\n[[Category:Petroleum engineering schools]]\n[[Category:Institutions of Petroleum in India]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e'''Global Offerings''':Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Petroleum_and_Energy_Studies"}
