It is derived from the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] [[suanpan]], imported to Japan in the 14th century.<ref name=gul>{{harvnb|Gullberg|1997|p=169}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|name=intro|Some sources give a date of introduction of around 1600.<ref name=Fer>{{harvnb|Fernandes|2013}}</ref>}} Like the suanpan, the soroban is still used today, despite the proliferation of practical and affordable pocket [[electronic calculator]]s.\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Science museum 030.jpg|thumb|A suanpan (top) and a soroban (bottom). The two abaci seen here are of standard size and have thirteen rods each.]]\n[[File:\u0686\u0631\u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u0698\u0627\u067e\u0646\u06cc.jpg|thumb|Another variants of Soroban]]\nThe soroban is composed of an odd number of columns or rods, each having beads: one separate bead having a value of five, called {{nihongo|'''go-dama'''|\u4e94\u7389, \u3054\u3060\u307e||\"five-bead\"}} and four beads each having a value of one, called {{nihongo|'''ichi-dama'''|\u4e00\u7389, \u3044\u3061\u3060\u307e||\"one-bead\"}}. Each set of beads of each rod is divided by a bar known as a reckoning bar. The number and size of beads in each rod make a standard-sized 13-rod soroban much less bulky than a standard-sized suanpan of similar expressive power.\n\nThe number of rods in a soroban is always odd and never fewer than nine. Basic models usually have thirteen rods, but the number of rods on practical or standard models often increases to 21, 23, 27 or even 31, thus allowing calculation of more digits or representations of several different numbers at the same time. Each rod represents a digit, and a larger number of rods allows the representation of more digits, either in singular form or during operations.\n\nThe beads and rods are made of a variety of different materials. Most soroban made in Japan are made of wood and have wood, metal, [[rattan]], or [[bamboo]] rods for the beads to slide on. The beads themselves are usually [[Bicone|biconal]] (shaped like a double-cone). They are normally made of wood, although the beads of some soroban, especially those made outside Japan, can be [[marble]], stone, or even plastic. The cost of a soroban is commensurate with the materials used in its construction.\n\nOne unique feature that sets the soroban apart from its Chinese cousin is a dot marking every third rod in a soroban. These are ''unit rods'' and any one of them is designated to denote the last digit of the whole number part of the calculation answer. Any number that is represented on rods to the right of this designated rod is part of the decimal part of the answer, unless the number is part of a division or multiplication calculation. Unit rods to the left of the designated one also aid in place value by denoting the groups in the number (such as thousands, millions, etc.). Suanpan usually do not have this feature.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Representation of numbers===\n\nThe soroban uses a decimal system, where each of the rods can represent a single digit from 0 to 9. By moving beads towards the reckoning bar, they are put in the \"on\" position; i.e., they assume value. For the \"five bead\" this means it is moved downwards, while \"one beads\" are moved upwards. In this manner, all digits from 0 to 9 can be represented by different configurations of beads, as shown below:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Representation of digits 0 - 9 on the soroban'''\n|[[File:Soroban 0.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 1.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 2.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 4.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 5.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 7.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 9.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9\n|}\n</center>\n\nThese digits can subsequently be used to represent multiple-digit numbers. This is done in the same way as in Western, decimal notation: the rightmost digit represents units, the one to the left of it represents tens, etc. The number ''8036'', for instance, is represented by the following configuration:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 0.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6 c.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|8||0||3||6\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe soroban user is free to choose which rod is used for the units; typically this will be one of the rods marked with a dot (see the 6 in the example above). Any digits to the right of the units represent decimals: tenths, hundredths, etc. In order to change ''8036'' into ''80.36'', for instance, the user places the digits in such a way that the 0 falls on a rod marked with a dot:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 0 c.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|8||0.||3||6\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Methods of operation===\nThe methods of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] on a soroban are basically the same as the equivalent operations on a suanpan, with basic addition and subtraction making use of a [[complementary number]] to add or subtract ten in carrying over.\n\nThere are many methods to perform both [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] on a soroban, especially Chinese methods that came with the importation of the suanpan. The authority in Japan on the soroban, the [[Japan Abacus Committee]], has recommended so-called standard methods for both multiplication and division which require only the use of the [[multiplication table]]. These methods were chosen for efficiency and speed in calculation.\n\nBecause the soroban developed through a reduction in the number of beads from seven, to six, and then to the present five, these methods can be used on the suanpan as well as on soroban produced before the 1930s, which have five \"one\" beads and one \"five\" bead.\n\n=={{anchor|Sorokaru}}Modern use==\n[[File:Sharp-abacus-japan.jpg|thumb|A dual soroban-calculator, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] Elsi Mate EL-8048 Sorokaru, produced from 1979]]\n[[File:Indian Abacus .jpg|alt=An abacus that uses colored sliders instead of beads.

Now, the strive is for speed and turning out deliverables rather than understanding the subtle intricacies of the concepts behind the product. Calculators have since replaced sorobans, and elementary schools are no longer required to teach students how to use the soroban, though some do so by choice. The growing popularity of calculators within the context of Japanese modernization has driven the study of soroban from public schools to private after school classrooms. Where once it was an institutionally required subject in school for children grades 2 to 6, current laws have made keeping this art form and perspective on math practiced amongst the younger generations more lenient.<ref>{{cite web |title=Soroban in Education and Modern Japanese Society |url=http://www.shuzan.jp/english/education/ |website=History of Soroban |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> Today, it shifted from a given to a game where one can take The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry's examination in order to obtain a certificate and license.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kojima | first = Takashi | year = 1954 | title = The Japanese Abacus: its Use and Theory | url = https://archive.org/details/japaneseabacusit00koji | url-access = registration | publisher = Charles E.

Those obtaining at least a third-grade certificate/license are qualified to work in public corporations.\n\nThe soroban is still taught in some primary schools as a way to visualize and grapple with mathematical concepts. The practice of soroban includes the teacher reciting a string of numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a song-like manner where at the end, the answer is given by the teacher. This helps train the ability to follow the tempo given by the teacher while remaining calm and accurate. In this way, it reflects on a fundamental aspect of Japanese culture of practicing meditative repetition in every aspect of life.<ref name=\"Zen and the Japanese Culture\"/> Primary school students often bring two soroban to class, one with the modern configuration and the one having the older configuration of one heavenly bead and five earth beads.\n\nShortly after the beginning of one's soroban studies, drills to enhance mental calculation, known as anzan(\u6697\u7b97, \"blind calculation\") in Japanese are incorporated. Students are asked to solve problems mentally by visualizing the soroban and working out the solution by moving the beads theoretically in one's mind. The mastery of anzan is one reason why, despite the access to handheld calculators, some parents still send their children to private tutors to learn the soroban.\n\nThe soroban is also the basis for two kinds of abaci developed for the use of blind people. One is the toggle-type abacus wherein flip switches are used instead of beads. The second is the Cranmer abacus which has circular beads, longer rods, and a leather backcover so the beads do not slide around when in use.\n\n==Brief history==\nThe soroban's physical resemblance is derived from the [[suanpan]] but the number of beads is identical to the [[Roman abacus]], which had four beads below and one at the top.\n\nMost historians on the soroban agree that it has its roots on the suanpan's importation to Japan via the Korean peninsula around the 14th century.<ref name=gul/>{{refn|group=nb|name=intro}} When the suanpan first became native to Japan as the soroban (with its beads modified for ease of use), it had two heavenly beads and five earth beads. But the soroban was not widely used until the 17th century, although it was in use by Japanese merchants since its introduction.<ref>[http://www.soroban.com/japanese/history/ \"\u305d\u308d\u3070\u3093\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3000\u30fc\u3000\u897f\u6b27\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u65e5\u672c\u3078\"], \"\u30c8\u30e2\u30a8\u305d\u308d\u3070\u3093\", Retrieved 2017-10-19.</ref> Once the soroban became popularly known, several Japanese mathematicians, including [[Seki K\u014dwa]], studied it extensively. These studies became evident on the improvements on the soroban itself and the operations used on it.\n\nIn the construction of the soroban itself, the number of beads had begun to decrease.  In around 1850, one heavenly bead was removed from the suanpan configuration of two heavenly beads and five earth beads. This new Japanese configuration existed concurrently with the suanpan until the start of the [[Meiji era]], after which the suanpan fell completely out of use. In 1891, Irie Gary\u016b further removed one earth bead, forming the modern configuration of one heavenly bead and four earth beads.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric | first1 = Louis | title = Japan encyclopedia| others = translated by K\u00e4the Roth  | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2005 |pages=303, 903 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> This configuration was later reintroduced in 1930 and became popular in the 1940s.\n\nAlso, when the suanpan was imported to Japan, it came along with its division table. The method of using the table was called {{nihongo|''ky\u016bkih\u014d''|\u4e5d\u5e30\u6cd5||\"nine returning method\"}} in Japanese, while the table itself was called the {{nihongo|''hassan''|\u516b\u7b97||\"eight calculation\"}}. The [[Suanpan#Beads|division table]] used along with the suanpan was more popular because of the original hexadecimal configuration of [[Japanese currency]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}. But because using the division table was complicated and it should be remembered along with the multiplication table, it soon fell out in 1935 (soon after the soroban's present form was reintroduced in 1930), with a so-called standard method replacing the use of the division table. This standard method of division, recommended today by the Japan Abacus Committee, is in fact an old method which used [[counting rods]], first suggested by mathematician Momokawa Chubei in 1645,<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = David Eugene | last2 = Mikami | first2 = Yoshio | title = A History of Japanese Mathematics | publisher = The Open Court Publishing | year = 1914 |chapter=Chapter III: The Development of the Soroban. |pages=43\u201344 | postscript = <!--None-->}} [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=93950015 Free digital copy] available at [[Questia Online Library|Questia]].</ref> and therefore had to compete with the division table during the latter's heyday.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Comparison with the electric calculator==\nOn November 12, 1946, a contest was held in Tokyo between the Japanese soroban, used by [[Kiyoshi Matsuzaki]], and an electric calculator, operated by US Army Private Thomas Nathan Wood. The basis for scoring in the contest was speed and accuracy of results in all four basic arithmetic operations and a problem which combines all four. The soroban won 4 to 1, with the electric calculator prevailing in multiplication.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=Edward|title=Speed Mathematics Simplified|year=1994|publisher=Dover|pages=12}}</ref>\n\nAbout the event, the ''Nippon Times'' newspaper reported that \"Civilization ... tottered\" that day, while the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper described the soroban's \"decisive\" victory as an event in which \"the [[machine age]] took a step backward....\".\n\nThe breakdown of results is as follows:\n*Five additions problems for each heat, each problem consisting of 50 three- to six-digit numbers. The soroban won in two successive heats.\n*Five subtraction problems for each heat, each problem having six- to eight-digit minuends and subtrahends. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the second heat was a [[No contest (boxing)|no contest]].\n*Five multiplication problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit factors. The calculator won in the first and third heats; the soroban won on the second.\n*Five division problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit dividends and divisors. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the calculator won on the second.\n*A composite problem which the soroban answered correctly and won on this round.

The two abaci seen here are of standard size and have thirteen rods each.]]\n[[File:\u0686\u0631\u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u0698\u0627\u067e\u0646\u06cc.jpg|thumb|Another variants of Soroban]]\nThe soroban is composed of an odd number of columns or rods, each having beads: one separate bead having a value of five, called {{nihongo|'''go-dama'''|\u4e94\u7389, \u3054\u3060\u307e||\"five-bead\"}} and four beads each having a value of one, called {{nihongo|'''ichi-dama'''|\u4e00\u7389, \u3044\u3061\u3060\u307e||\"one-bead\"}}. Each set of beads of each rod is divided by a bar known as a reckoning bar. The number and size of beads in each rod make a standard-sized 13-rod soroban much less bulky than a standard-sized suanpan of similar expressive power.\n\nThe number of rods in a soroban is always odd and never fewer than nine. Basic models usually have thirteen rods, but the number of rods on practical or standard models often increases to 21, 23, 27 or even 31, thus allowing calculation of more digits or representations of several different numbers at the same time. Each rod represents a digit, and a larger number of rods allows the representation of more digits, either in singular form or during operations.\n\nThe beads and rods are made of a variety of different materials. Most soroban made in Japan are made of wood and have wood, metal, [[rattan]], or [[bamboo]] rods for the beads to slide on. The beads themselves are usually [[Bicone|biconal]] (shaped like a double-cone). They are normally made of wood, although the beads of some soroban, especially those made outside Japan, can be [[marble]], stone, or even plastic. The cost of a soroban is commensurate with the materials used in its construction.\n\nOne unique feature that sets the soroban apart from its Chinese cousin is a dot marking every third rod in a soroban. These are ''unit rods'' and any one of them is designated to denote the last digit of the whole number part of the calculation answer. Any number that is represented on rods to the right of this designated rod is part of the decimal part of the answer, unless the number is part of a division or multiplication calculation. Unit rods to the left of the designated one also aid in place value by denoting the groups in the number (such as thousands, millions, etc.). Suanpan usually do not have this feature.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Representation of numbers===\n\nThe soroban uses a decimal system, where each of the rods can represent a single digit from 0 to 9. By moving beads towards the reckoning bar, they are put in the \"on\" position; i.e., they assume value. For the \"five bead\" this means it is moved downwards, while \"one beads\" are moved upwards. In this manner, all digits from 0 to 9 can be represented by different configurations of beads, as shown below:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Representation of digits 0 - 9 on the soroban'''\n|[[File:Soroban 0.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 1.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 2.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 4.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 5.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 7.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 9.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9\n|}\n</center>\n\nThese digits can subsequently be used to represent multiple-digit numbers. This is done in the same way as in Western, decimal notation: the rightmost digit represents units, the one to the left of it represents tens, etc. The number ''8036'', for instance, is represented by the following configuration:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 0.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6 c.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|8||0||3||6\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe soroban user is free to choose which rod is used for the units; typically this will be one of the rods marked with a dot (see the 6 in the example above). Any digits to the right of the units represent decimals: tenths, hundredths, etc. In order to change ''8036'' into ''80.36'', for instance, the user places the digits in such a way that the 0 falls on a rod marked with a dot:\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|[[File:Soroban 8.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 0 c.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 3.svg|20px]]||[[File:Soroban 6.svg|20px]]\n|-\n|8||0.||3||6\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Methods of operation===\nThe methods of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] on a soroban are basically the same as the equivalent operations on a suanpan, with basic addition and subtraction making use of a [[complementary number]] to add or subtract ten in carrying over.\n\nThere are many methods to perform both [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] on a soroban, especially Chinese methods that came with the importation of the suanpan. The authority in Japan on the soroban, the [[Japan Abacus Committee]], has recommended so-called standard methods for both multiplication and division which require only the use of the [[multiplication table]]. These methods were chosen for efficiency and speed in calculation.\n\nBecause the soroban developed through a reduction in the number of beads from seven, to six, and then to the present five, these methods can be used on the suanpan as well as on soroban produced before the 1930s, which have five \"one\" beads and one \"five\" bead.\n\n=={{anchor|Sorokaru}}Modern use==\n[[File:Sharp-abacus-japan.jpg|thumb|A dual soroban-calculator, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] Elsi Mate EL-8048 Sorokaru, produced from 1979]]\n[[File:Indian Abacus .jpg|alt=An abacus that uses colored sliders instead of beads.

But the soroban was not widely used until the 17th century, although it was in use by Japanese merchants since its introduction.<ref>[http://www.soroban.com/japanese/history/ \"\u305d\u308d\u3070\u3093\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3000\u30fc\u3000\u897f\u6b27\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u65e5\u672c\u3078\"], \"\u30c8\u30e2\u30a8\u305d\u308d\u3070\u3093\", Retrieved 2017-10-19.</ref> Once the soroban became popularly known, several Japanese mathematicians, including [[Seki K\u014dwa]], studied it extensively. These studies became evident on the improvements on the soroban itself and the operations used on it.\n\nIn the construction of the soroban itself, the number of beads had begun to decrease.  In around 1850, one heavenly bead was removed from the suanpan configuration of two heavenly beads and five earth beads. This new Japanese configuration existed concurrently with the suanpan until the start of the [[Meiji era]], after which the suanpan fell completely out of use. In 1891, Irie Gary\u016b further removed one earth bead, forming the modern configuration of one heavenly bead and four earth beads.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric | first1 = Louis | title = Japan encyclopedia| others = translated by K\u00e4the Roth  | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2005 |pages=303, 903 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> This configuration was later reintroduced in 1930 and became popular in the 1940s.\n\nAlso, when the suanpan was imported to Japan, it came along with its division table. The method of using the table was called {{nihongo|''ky\u016bkih\u014d''|\u4e5d\u5e30\u6cd5||\"nine returning method\"}} in Japanese, while the table itself was called the {{nihongo|''hassan''|\u516b\u7b97||\"eight calculation\"}}. The [[Suanpan#Beads|division table]] used along with the suanpan was more popular because of the original hexadecimal configuration of [[Japanese currency]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}. But because using the division table was complicated and it should be remembered along with the multiplication table, it soon fell out in 1935 (soon after the soroban's present form was reintroduced in 1930), with a so-called standard method replacing the use of the division table. This standard method of division, recommended today by the Japan Abacus Committee, is in fact an old method which used [[counting rods]], first suggested by mathematician Momokawa Chubei in 1645,<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = David Eugene | last2 = Mikami | first2 = Yoshio | title = A History of Japanese Mathematics | publisher = The Open Court Publishing | year = 1914 |chapter=Chapter III: The Development of the Soroban. |pages=43\u201344 | postscript = <!--None-->}} [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=93950015 Free digital copy] available at [[Questia Online Library|Questia]].</ref> and therefore had to compete with the division table during the latter's heyday.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Comparison with the electric calculator==\nOn November 12, 1946, a contest was held in Tokyo between the Japanese soroban, used by [[Kiyoshi Matsuzaki]], and an electric calculator, operated by US Army Private Thomas Nathan Wood. The basis for scoring in the contest was speed and accuracy of results in all four basic arithmetic operations and a problem which combines all four. The soroban won 4 to 1, with the electric calculator prevailing in multiplication.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=Edward|title=Speed Mathematics Simplified|year=1994|publisher=Dover|pages=12}}</ref>\n\nAbout the event, the ''Nippon Times'' newspaper reported that \"Civilization ... tottered\" that day, while the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper described the soroban's \"decisive\" victory as an event in which \"the [[machine age]] took a step backward....\".\n\nThe breakdown of results is as follows:\n*Five additions problems for each heat, each problem consisting of 50 three- to six-digit numbers. The soroban won in two successive heats.\n*Five subtraction problems for each heat, each problem having six- to eight-digit minuends and subtrahends. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the second heat was a [[No contest (boxing)|no contest]].\n*Five multiplication problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit factors. The calculator won in the first and third heats; the soroban won on the second.\n*Five division problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit dividends and divisors. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the calculator won on the second.\n*A composite problem which the soroban answered correctly and won on this round.

Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]], urged on by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]], ordered a series of political [[extrajudicial]] executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), the Nazis' [[paramilitary]] organization. Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent [[coup]] by the SA under R\u00f6hm \u2013 the so-called ''R\u00f6hm Putsch''.\n\nThe primary instruments of Hitler's action, which carried out most of the killings, were the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its [[Sicherheitsdienst|Security Service]] (SD) and [[Gestapo]] ([[secret police]]) under [[Reinhard Heydrich]]. [[1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring's personal police battalion]] also took part in the killings. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being R\u00f6hm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the leftist-leaning [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] faction of the [[Nazi Party]], including its figurehead, [[Gregor Strasser]], were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Bavaria]]n politician [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], who had suppressed Hitler's Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.\n\nHitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to conciliate leaders of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of R\u00f6hm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with R\u00f6hm's outspoken support for a \"second revolution\" to redistribute wealth. In R\u00f6hm's view, President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'s appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30, 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power, but had left unfulfilled the party's larger goals. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate [[German resistance to Nazism|German critics]] of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], as well as to settle scores with old enemies.{{efn|name=Papen}}\n\n[[Victims of the Night of the Long Knives|At least 85 people]] died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds,{{efn|name=Evans p39}}{{efn|name=Kershaw p517}}{{efn|name=Johnson_298}} with high estimates running from 700 to 1,000.<ref name=\"Erik Larson 2011 p. 314\">[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks p. 314 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}; citing:<br />- memoranda in the [[William E.

It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against [[extrajudicial killing]]s to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government.{{sfn|Johnson|1991|pp=298\u2013299}} It established Hitler as the supreme administrator of justice of the German people, as he put it in his July 13 speech to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]].\n\nBefore its execution, its planners sometimes referred to the purge as ''Hummingbird'' (German: {{lang|de|Kolibri}}), the codeword used to send the execution squads into action on the day of the purge.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=515}} The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase \"Night of the Long Knives\" in the German language predates the killings and refers generally to acts of vengeance.\n\n==Hitler and the ''Sturmabteilung'' (SA)==\n[[File:Hitler 1928 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitler posing in [[Nuremberg]] with SA members in 1928. [[Julius Streicher]] is to the left of Hitler, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] stands beneath Hitler]]\n\n[[President of Germany#Weimar Republic presidency|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on January 30, 1933.{{efn|name=1932 parliamentary elections}} Over the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|next few months]], during the so-called ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', Hitler dispensed with the need for the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] as a [[legislature|legislative body]]{{efn|name=Enabling Act}} and eliminated all [[List of political parties in Germany#Parties existing before World War II|rival political parties]] in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a [[one-party state]] under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected [[veteran]] [[field marshal]]. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to [[conscription]], and a more aggressive [[foreign policy]], the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.\n\nTo a lesser extent, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the [[Freikorps]] movement of the post-World War I years. The ''Freikorps'' were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans founded by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the ''Freikorps'' believed that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|November Revolution]] had [[Stab-in-the-back myth|betrayed]] them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the ''Freikorps'' were in opposition to the new [[Weimar Republic]], which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called \"November criminals\". Captain [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] of the ''Reichswehr'' served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. R\u00f6hm was given the nickname \"The Machine Gun King of Bavaria\" in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. R\u00f6hm left the ''Reichswehr'' in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]]. Also known as the \"brownshirts\" or \"stormtroopers,\" the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists.{{sfn|Reiche|2002|pp=120\u2013121}} The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilization of Germany's inter-war experiment with [[democracy]], the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=266}} In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=165}}\n\nHitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking; they would attack passers-by and then attack the police who were called to stop them.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=23}} Complaints of \"overbearing and loutish\" behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The [[Federal Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=501}}\n\nHitler's move would be to strengthen his position with the army by moving against its nemesis, the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=435}} On July 6, 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]], or Nazi, [[Nazi seizure of power|brown revolution]]. Now that the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, \"The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution.\"{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=20}}\n\nHitler's speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of [[Great Depression in Central Europe|the Great Depression]], when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively&nbsp;\u2013 or even primarily&nbsp;\u2013 a [[working class]] phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour.{{efn|name=Schoenbaum pp. 35\u201342}} Many stormtroopers believed in the [[socialism|socialist]] promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.{{efn|name=Bullock p80}}\n\n==Conflict between the army and the SA==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:DerSiegdesGlaubens.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for [[Der Sieg des Glaubens]] by Leni Riefenstahl in 1933]] -->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14393, Ernst R\u00f6hm crop.jpg|thumb|upright|SA leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] in [[Bavaria]] in 1934]]\nNo one in the SA spoke more loudly for \"a continuation of the German revolution\" (as one prominent stormtrooper, [[Edmund Heines]], put it) than R\u00f6hm himself.{{efn|name=Frei p126}} R\u00f6hm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of [[World War I]], R\u00f6hm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper.{{sfn|Frei|1987|p=13}} R\u00f6hm saw violence as a means to political ends. He took seriously the socialist promise of National Socialism, and demanded that Hitler and the other party leaders initiate wide-ranging socialist reform in Germany.\n\nNot content solely with the leadership of the SA, R\u00f6hm [[lobbying|lobbied]] Hitler to appoint him [[defence minister|Minister of Defence]], a position held by the conservative General [[Werner von Blomberg]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=24}} Although nicknamed the \"Rubber Lion\" by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the [[Prussian nobility]], and regarded the SA as a [[Plebs|plebeian]] rabble that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|pp=712\u2013739}}\n\nIf the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in [[Rummelsburg]], denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, \"Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army.\"{{sfn|Bessel|1984|p=97}}\n\nDespite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalized army. R\u00f6hm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}} In January 1934, R\u00f6hm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|p=726}}\n\nIn response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on February 28, 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, R\u00f6hm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, R\u00f6hm declared that he would not take instructions from \"the ridiculous corporal\"&nbsp;\u2013 a demeaning reference to Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=26}} While Hitler did not take immediate action against R\u00f6hm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them.\n\n==Growing pressure against the SA==\n\nDespite his earlier agreement with Hitler, R\u00f6hm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, R\u00f6hm's success could come only at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared R\u00f6hm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including [[Free State of Prussia|Prussian]] premier [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], and Hitler's deputy [[Rudolf Hess]], positioning themselves against R\u00f6hm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only R\u00f6hm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. R\u00f6hm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned G\u00f6ring, Minister-President of Prussia.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|p=33}}\n\nFinally in the spring of 1934, the growing rift between R\u00f6hm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], to start playing politics again.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315\u2013316}} Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] and [[Werner von Alvensleben]] started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, R\u00f6hm Minister of Defence, [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] Foreign Minister and [[Gregor Strasser]] Minister of National Economy.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315\u2013316}} The British historian Sir [[John Wheeler-Bennett]], who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a \"lack of discretion\" that was \"terrifying\" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=316}} Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with R\u00f6hm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}\n\nAs a means of isolating R\u00f6hm, on April 20, 1934, G\u00f6ring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, G\u00f6ring believed, could be counted on to move against R\u00f6hm.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=29}} Himmler named his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to head the Gestapo on April 22, 1934.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}} Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and Heydrich had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against R\u00f6hm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be \"liquidated\" started to circulate amongst G\u00f6ring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} At the end of May two former Chancellors, Heinrich Br\u00fcning and Kurt von Schleicher, received warnings from friends in the ''Reichswehr'' that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} Br\u00fcning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}\n\n[[File:Vonpapen1 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz von Papen]], the conservative vice-chancellor who ran afoul of Hitler after denouncing the regime's failure to rein in the SA in his [[Marburg speech]].

Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against R\u00f6hm. While R\u00f6hm's [[homosexuality]] did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet [[Benito Mussolini]] on June 15.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=317\u2013318}} Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary [[Otto Mei\u00dfner]], Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] ordered the German Ambassador to Italy [[Ulrich von Hassell]]&nbsp;\u2013 without Hitler's knowledge&nbsp;\u2013 to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]] as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}}\n\nOn June 17, 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave [[Marburg speech|a speech]] at [[University of Marburg|Marburg University]] warning of the threat of a \"second revolution.\"{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|pp=308\u2013312}} According to his memoirs, von Papen, a [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholic]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] with ties to army and industry, privately threatened to resign if Hitler did not act.{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|p=309}} While von Papen's resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler's position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative.\n\n==Heydrich and Himmler==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-50-10, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|''SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the Bavarian police and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], in Munich, 1934|alt=]]\nIn response to conservative pressure to constrain R\u00f6hm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].

However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying R\u00f6hm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and G\u00f6ring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by R\u00f6hm's downfall&nbsp;\u2013 the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=31}}\n\nIn preparation for the purge, both Himmler and Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that R\u00f6hm had been paid 12 million [[Reichsmark]] (EUR {{Format price|{{#expr:{{inflation|DE|12000000|1934|r=0}} / 1.95583}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) by France to overthrow Hitler.

SS men stormed the hotel, and Hitler personally placed R\u00f6hm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. The SS found [[Breslau]] SA leader [[Edmund Heines]] in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader.

Hitler told the crowd that \"undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements\" would be annihilated.

Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on G\u00f6ring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary [[Herbert von Bose]] without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate [[Edgar Julius Jung|Edgar Jung]], the author of Papen's [[Marburg speech]], and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=34}} The Gestapo also murdered [[Erich Klausener]], the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor.

Both [[Kurt von Schleicher]], Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home.

In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador [[Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet]], and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet was not declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government.\n\nThe army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|pp=33\u201334}} One retired captain, [[Erwin Planck]], seemed to realize this: \"If you look on without lifting a finger,\" he said to his friend, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], \"you will meet the same fate sooner or later.\"{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1970|pp=113\u2013118}} Another rare exception was Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.{{sfn|Schwarzm\u00fcller|1995|pp=299\u2013306}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99203, Berlin, Wahlplakat f\u00fcr Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|Election poster for [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1932 (translation: \"With him\")]]\nRumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread.

The undersigned Generals and senior officers swear to preserve to the last breath their loyalty to you and the Fatherland.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}}}}\n\nHindenburg never responded to the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as [[Otto Meissner|Otto Mei\u00dfner]], who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=330}} It is noteworthy that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they wanted to see continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=329\u2013330}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0402-504, Generaloberst Werner von Blomberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Werner von Blomberg]] in 1934]]\nIn late 1934\u2013early 1935, [[Werner von Fritsch]] and [[Werner von Blomberg]], who had been shamed into joining Hammerstein and Mackensen's rehabilitation campaign, successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating Generals von Schleicher and von Bredow.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=336}} Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July, which portrayed them as the vilest traitors, working against the Fatherland in the pay of France.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=336}} In a speech given on January 3, 1935 at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot \"in error\" on the basis of false information, and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=337}} Hitler's speech was not reported in the German press, but the army was appeased by the speech.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=337}} However, despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers, the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, G\u00f6ring told [[Jan Szembek (diplomat)|Jan Szembek]] that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} During a meeting with Polish Ambassador [[J\u00f3zef Lipski]] on May 22, 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was \"rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the [[Rapallo Treaty]].\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German\u2013Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}}\n\nFormer [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], who was in exile in [[Doorn]], Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He asked, \"What would people have said if I had done such a thing?\"<ref name=mac452>Macdonogh 2001, pp. 452\u201353</ref> Hearing of the murder of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, \"We have ceased to live under the [[rule of law]] and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!\"<ref name=mac452 />\n\n==SA leadership==\nHitler named [[Viktor Lutze]] to replace R\u00f6hm as head of the SA. Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to \"homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living\" in the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Lutze did little to assert the SA's independence in the coming years, and the SA lost its power in Germany. Membership in the organization plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=40}}\n\nAccording to [[Albert Speer|Speer]], \"the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler&nbsp;... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated.\"{{sfn|Speer|1995|pp=90-93}}\n\nR\u00f6hm was purged from all [[Nazi propaganda]], such as ''[[The Victory of Faith]]'', the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film about the 1933 [[Nuremberg rally]], which showed R\u00f6hm frequently alongside Hitler; a copy of the original survived and was found in the United Kingdom many years later.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as \"the supreme leader of the German people\", as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself ''[[de jure]]'' as well as ''[[de facto]]'' [[Sovereign immunity|above the reach of the law]]. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power.{{efn|name=Evans p72}} Years later, in November 1945, while being interviewed by psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] in his cell during the [[Nuremburg Trials]], [[Goering]] angrily justified the killings to Gilbert, \"It's a damn good thing I wiped them out, or they would have wiped us out!\" {{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=79}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Damned (1969 film)|''The Damned'' (1969 film)]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* ''[[The Victory of Faith|Der Sieg des Glaubens]]''\n* [[Victims of the Night of the Long Knives]]\n* ''[[White Book of the Purge]]''\n* [[Kurt Ludecke]]\n\n==References==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{Notelist\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = Papen\n| Papen, nonetheless, remained in his position although people quite close to him were murdered, including [[Edgar Jung]], the writer of the [[Marburg speech]] Papen had given which was critical of the Nazi regime.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = Evans p39\n| \"At least eighty-five people are known to have been summarily killed without any formal legal proceedings being taken against them.

Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]], urged on by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]], ordered a series of political [[extrajudicial]] executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), the Nazis' [[paramilitary]] organization. Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent [[coup]] by the SA under R\u00f6hm \u2013 the so-called ''R\u00f6hm Putsch''.\n\nThe primary instruments of Hitler's action, which carried out most of the killings, were the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its [[Sicherheitsdienst|Security Service]] (SD) and [[Gestapo]] ([[secret police]]) under [[Reinhard Heydrich]]. [[1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring's personal police battalion]] also took part in the killings. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being R\u00f6hm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the leftist-leaning [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] faction of the [[Nazi Party]], including its figurehead, [[Gregor Strasser]], were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Bavaria]]n politician [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], who had suppressed Hitler's Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.\n\nHitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to conciliate leaders of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of R\u00f6hm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with R\u00f6hm's outspoken support for a \"second revolution\" to redistribute wealth. In R\u00f6hm's view, President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'s appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30, 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power, but had left unfulfilled the party's larger goals. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate [[German resistance to Nazism|German critics]] of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], as well as to settle scores with old enemies.{{efn|name=Papen}}\n\n[[Victims of the Night of the Long Knives|At least 85 people]] died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds,{{efn|name=Evans p39}}{{efn|name=Kershaw p517}}{{efn|name=Johnson_298}} with high estimates running from 700 to 1,000.<ref name=\"Erik Larson 2011 p. 314\">[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks p. 314 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}; citing:<br />- memoranda in the [[William E.

It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against [[extrajudicial killing]]s to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government.{{sfn|Johnson|1991|pp=298\u2013299}} It established Hitler as the supreme administrator of justice of the German people, as he put it in his July 13 speech to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]].\n\nBefore its execution, its planners sometimes referred to the purge as ''Hummingbird'' (German: {{lang|de|Kolibri}}), the codeword used to send the execution squads into action on the day of the purge.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=515}} The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase \"Night of the Long Knives\" in the German language predates the killings and refers generally to acts of vengeance.\n\n==Hitler and the ''Sturmabteilung'' (SA)==\n[[File:Hitler 1928 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitler posing in [[Nuremberg]] with SA members in 1928. [[Julius Streicher]] is to the left of Hitler, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] stands beneath Hitler]]\n\n[[President of Germany#Weimar Republic presidency|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on January 30, 1933.{{efn|name=1932 parliamentary elections}} Over the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|next few months]], during the so-called ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', Hitler dispensed with the need for the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] as a [[legislature|legislative body]]{{efn|name=Enabling Act}} and eliminated all [[List of political parties in Germany#Parties existing before World War II|rival political parties]] in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a [[one-party state]] under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected [[veteran]] [[field marshal]]. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to [[conscription]], and a more aggressive [[foreign policy]], the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.\n\nTo a lesser extent, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the [[Freikorps]] movement of the post-World War I years. The ''Freikorps'' were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans founded by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the ''Freikorps'' believed that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|November Revolution]] had [[Stab-in-the-back myth|betrayed]] them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the ''Freikorps'' were in opposition to the new [[Weimar Republic]], which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called \"November criminals\". Captain [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] of the ''Reichswehr'' served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. R\u00f6hm was given the nickname \"The Machine Gun King of Bavaria\" in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. R\u00f6hm left the ''Reichswehr'' in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]]. Also known as the \"brownshirts\" or \"stormtroopers,\" the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists.{{sfn|Reiche|2002|pp=120\u2013121}} The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilization of Germany's inter-war experiment with [[democracy]], the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=266}} In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=165}}\n\nHitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking; they would attack passers-by and then attack the police who were called to stop them.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=23}} Complaints of \"overbearing and loutish\" behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The [[Federal Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=501}}\n\nHitler's move would be to strengthen his position with the army by moving against its nemesis, the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=435}} On July 6, 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]], or Nazi, [[Nazi seizure of power|brown revolution]]. Now that the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, \"The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution.\"{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=20}}\n\nHitler's speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of [[Great Depression in Central Europe|the Great Depression]], when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively&nbsp;\u2013 or even primarily&nbsp;\u2013 a [[working class]] phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour.{{efn|name=Schoenbaum pp. 35\u201342}} Many stormtroopers believed in the [[socialism|socialist]] promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.{{efn|name=Bullock p80}}\n\n==Conflict between the army and the SA==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:DerSiegdesGlaubens.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for [[Der Sieg des Glaubens]] by Leni Riefenstahl in 1933]] -->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14393, Ernst R\u00f6hm crop.jpg|thumb|upright|SA leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] in [[Bavaria]] in 1934]]\nNo one in the SA spoke more loudly for \"a continuation of the German revolution\" (as one prominent stormtrooper, [[Edmund Heines]], put it) than R\u00f6hm himself.{{efn|name=Frei p126}} R\u00f6hm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of [[World War I]], R\u00f6hm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper.{{sfn|Frei|1987|p=13}} R\u00f6hm saw violence as a means to political ends. He took seriously the socialist promise of National Socialism, and demanded that Hitler and the other party leaders initiate wide-ranging socialist reform in Germany.\n\nNot content solely with the leadership of the SA, R\u00f6hm [[lobbying|lobbied]] Hitler to appoint him [[defence minister|Minister of Defence]], a position held by the conservative General [[Werner von Blomberg]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=24}} Although nicknamed the \"Rubber Lion\" by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the [[Prussian nobility]], and regarded the SA as a [[Plebs|plebeian]] rabble that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|pp=712\u2013739}}\n\nIf the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in [[Rummelsburg]], denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, \"Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army.\"{{sfn|Bessel|1984|p=97}}\n\nDespite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalized army. R\u00f6hm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}} In January 1934, R\u00f6hm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|p=726}}\n\nIn response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on February 28, 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, R\u00f6hm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, R\u00f6hm declared that he would not take instructions from \"the ridiculous corporal\"&nbsp;\u2013 a demeaning reference to Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=26}} While Hitler did not take immediate action against R\u00f6hm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them.\n\n==Growing pressure against the SA==\n\nDespite his earlier agreement with Hitler, R\u00f6hm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, R\u00f6hm's success could come only at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared R\u00f6hm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including [[Free State of Prussia|Prussian]] premier [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], and Hitler's deputy [[Rudolf Hess]], positioning themselves against R\u00f6hm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only R\u00f6hm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. R\u00f6hm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned G\u00f6ring, Minister-President of Prussia.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|p=33}}\n\nFinally in the spring of 1934, the growing rift between R\u00f6hm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], to start playing politics again.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315\u2013316}} Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] and [[Werner von Alvensleben]] started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, R\u00f6hm Minister of Defence, [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] Foreign Minister and [[Gregor Strasser]] Minister of National Economy.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315\u2013316}} The British historian Sir [[John Wheeler-Bennett]], who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a \"lack of discretion\" that was \"terrifying\" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=316}} Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with R\u00f6hm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}\n\nAs a means of isolating R\u00f6hm, on April 20, 1934, G\u00f6ring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, G\u00f6ring believed, could be counted on to move against R\u00f6hm.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=29}} Himmler named his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to head the Gestapo on April 22, 1934.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}} Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and Heydrich had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against R\u00f6hm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be \"liquidated\" started to circulate amongst G\u00f6ring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} At the end of May two former Chancellors, Heinrich Br\u00fcning and Kurt von Schleicher, received warnings from friends in the ''Reichswehr'' that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} Br\u00fcning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}\n\n[[File:Vonpapen1 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz von Papen]], the conservative vice-chancellor who ran afoul of Hitler after denouncing the regime's failure to rein in the SA in his [[Marburg speech]]. (Picture taken 1946 at the Nuremberg trial)]]\n\nDemands for Hitler to constrain the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against R\u00f6hm. While R\u00f6hm's [[homosexuality]] did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet [[Benito Mussolini]] on June 15.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=317\u2013318}} Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary [[Otto Mei\u00dfner]], Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] ordered the German Ambassador to Italy [[Ulrich von Hassell]]&nbsp;\u2013 without Hitler's knowledge&nbsp;\u2013 to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]] as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}}\n\nOn June 17, 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave [[Marburg speech|a speech]] at [[University of Marburg|Marburg University]] warning of the threat of a \"second revolution.\"{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|pp=308\u2013312}} According to his memoirs, von Papen, a [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholic]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] with ties to army and industry, privately threatened to resign if Hitler did not act.{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|p=309}} While von Papen's resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler's position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative.\n\n==Heydrich and Himmler==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-50-10, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|''SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the Bavarian police and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], in Munich, 1934|alt=]]\nIn response to conservative pressure to constrain R\u00f6hm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the president, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against R\u00f6hm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring [[martial law]] and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against R\u00f6hm and his brownshirts.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|pp=319\u2013320}} Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against R\u00f6hm, in part due to R\u00f6hm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying R\u00f6hm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and G\u00f6ring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by R\u00f6hm's downfall&nbsp;\u2013 the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=31}}\n\nIn preparation for the purge, both Himmler and Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that R\u00f6hm had been paid 12 million [[Reichsmark]] (EUR {{Format price|{{#expr:{{inflation|DE|12000000|1934|r=0}} / 1.95583}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) by France to overthrow Hitler.

Enraged, Hitler tore the [[epaulet]]s off the shirt of ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst R\u00f6hm and his followers were staying.{{sfn|Bullock|1958|p=166}}\n\n[[File:Kurheim Hanselbauer.JPG|thumb|left|Hotel Lederer am See (former Kurheim Hanselbauer) in Bad Wiessee before its planned demolition in 2017.]]\nWith Hitler's arrival in Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel, and Hitler personally placed R\u00f6hm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. The SS found [[Breslau]] SA leader [[Edmund Heines]] in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside the hotel and shot.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on [[moral turpitude]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=514}} Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with R\u00f6hm and Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=32}}\n\nAlthough Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by R\u00f6hm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=514}} Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced \"the worst treachery in world history\". Hitler told the crowd that \"undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements\" would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the \"traitors\".{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=32}} Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion.

Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on G\u00f6ring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary [[Herbert von Bose]] without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate [[Edgar Julius Jung|Edgar Jung]], the author of Papen's [[Marburg speech]], and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=34}} The Gestapo also murdered [[Erich Klausener]], the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticize the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nHitler and Himmler unleashed the Gestapo against old enemies, as well. Both [[Kurt von Schleicher]], Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home. Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], the former Bavarian state commissioner who crushed the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1996|pp=78\u201379}} Kahr's fate was especially gruesome.

On July 1, at Hitler's behest, [[Theodor Eicke]], Commandant of the [[Dachau concentration camp]], and his SS adjutant [[Michael Lippert]] visited R\u00f6hm. Once inside R\u00f6hm's cell, they handed him a [[John Browning#Products|Browning]] pistol loaded with a single cartridge and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. R\u00f6hm demurred, telling them, \"If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.\"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to R\u00f6hm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=33}} Eicke and Lippert then shot R\u00f6hm, killing him.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=312}} In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for R\u00f6hm's murder. Until then, Lippert had been one of the few executioners of the purge to evade trial.

A telegram allegedly sent by the ailing [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], Germany's highly revered military hero, expressed his \"profoundly felt gratitude\", and congratulated Hitler for \"nipping treason in the bud\",{{sfn|Fest|1974|p=470}} although Hermann G\u00f6ring later admitted during the Nuremburg Trials that the telegram was never seen by Hindenburg, and was actually written by the Nazis. {{sfn|Gallo|1972|p=277}} General von Reichenau went so far as to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador [[Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet]], and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet was not declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government.\n\nThe army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|pp=33\u201334}} One retired captain, [[Erwin Planck]], seemed to realize this: \"If you look on without lifting a finger,\" he said to his friend, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], \"you will meet the same fate sooner or later.\"{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|1970|pp=113\u2013118}} Another rare exception was Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.{{sfn|Schwarzm\u00fcller|1995|pp=299\u2013306}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99203, Berlin, Wahlplakat f\u00fcr Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|Election poster for [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1932 (translation: \"With him\")]]\nRumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos.{{efn|name=Kershaw p87}} Luise Solmitz, a [[Hamburg]] schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's \"personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness\" in her private diary. She even compared him to [[Frederick the Great]], the 18th-century King of [[Prussia]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=39}}\n\nOthers were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow [[Germans]]. \"A very calm and easy going mailman,\" the diarist [[Victor Klemperer]] wrote, \"who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply ''sentenced'' them.'\" It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. \"A chancellor,\" he wrote, \"sentences and shoots members of his own private army!\"{{sfn|Klemperer|1998|p=74}} The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it.\n\nAmong the few exceptions were General [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]] and Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=328}} Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=328}} Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticized Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganize the government by firing Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]], [[Robert Ley]], Hermann G\u00f6ring, [[Werner von Blomberg]], Joseph Goebbels and [[Richard Walther Darr\u00e9]] from the Cabinet.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Instead, the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General [[Werner von Fritsch]] as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed) and [[Rudolf Nadolny]] as Foreign Minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the \"distant friendliness\" towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with:\n\n{{quote|Excellency, the gravity of the moment has compelled us to appeal to you as our Supreme Commander.

During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, G\u00f6ring told [[Jan Szembek (diplomat)|Jan Szembek]] that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} During a meeting with Polish Ambassador [[J\u00f3zef Lipski]] on May 22, 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was \"rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the [[Rapallo Treaty]].\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German\u2013Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}}\n\nFormer [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], who was in exile in [[Doorn]], Netherlands, was horrified by the purge.

Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to \"homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living\" in the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Lutze did little to assert the SA's independence in the coming years, and the SA lost its power in Germany. Membership in the organization plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=40}}\n\nAccording to [[Albert Speer|Speer]], \"the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler&nbsp;... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated.\"{{sfn|Speer|1995|pp=90-93}}\n\nR\u00f6hm was purged from all [[Nazi propaganda]], such as ''[[The Victory of Faith]]'', the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film about the 1933 [[Nuremberg rally]], which showed R\u00f6hm frequently alongside Hitler; a copy of the original survived and was found in the United Kingdom many years later.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as \"the supreme leader of the German people\", as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself ''[[de jure]]'' as well as ''[[de facto]]'' [[Sovereign immunity|above the reach of the law]]. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power.{{efn|name=Evans p72}} Years later, in November 1945, while being interviewed by psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] in his cell during the [[Nuremburg Trials]], [[Goering]] angrily justified the killings to Gilbert, \"It's a damn good thing I wiped them out, or they would have wiped us out!\" {{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=79}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Damned (1969 film)|''The Damned'' (1969 film)]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* ''[[The Victory of Faith|Der Sieg des Glaubens]]''\n* [[Victims of the Night of the Long Knives]]\n* ''[[White Book of the Purge]]''\n* [[Kurt Ludecke]]\n\n==References==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{Notelist\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = Papen\n| Papen, nonetheless, remained in his position although people quite close to him were murdered, including [[Edgar Jung]], the writer of the [[Marburg speech]] Papen had given which was critical of the Nazi regime.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = Evans p39\n| \"At least eighty-five people are known to have been summarily killed without any formal legal proceedings being taken against them.

Following his ''The Rival Candidates'', his libretto for ''The Flitch of Bacon'' (1778) was the first of his collaboration with the composer [[William Shield]], whom he assisted in bringing to prominence.

The language's earlier survival had been due to its role in overcoming distance and terrain, in addition to the ease with which it is learned by native speakers.<ref name=\"Busnel, Classe, p 8\"/> Most significantly, in the period from the 1960s to 1980s, many people had turned away from [[agriculture]] and so many [[middle class]] families did not want their children to speak the language as it was negatively associated with the rural [[peasants]].\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[language revitalization]] efforts began and initiatives from within the community started. By 1999, the revitalization of Silbo Gomero was furthered by [[education policies]] and other legislative measures. It now has official protection as an example of [[intangible cultural heritage]].\n\n==Speakers==\nMany people in La Gomera speak Silbo Gomero, but their expression of the language deviates in minor ways which show the different origins of the speaker. As reported in a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, all the people living in La Gomera understand the language, but only those born before 1950 and the younger generations who attended school since 1999 can speak the language.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00172 |title= Whistled language of the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands), the Silbo Gomero |publisher= Fourth Session of the Intergovernmental Committee 2009 (4.COM)|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Those born before 1950 were taught the language by their elders in their homes, and those who have attended or are attending school since 1999 were taught the language formally in school. Those born between 1950 and 1980 understand the language but are unable to speak it, as the language was hardly used and negatively viewed during their time of [[language acquisition]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Revitalization==\nWhen this medium of communication was endangered  in the late 20th century, [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] efforts were generated at both community level and governmental level. A combination of initiatives from the La Gomeran community and policies implemented by the authorities saw Silbo Gomero being revitalized and maintained as a cultural asset. These revitalization efforts were well-documented by UNESCO as part of the proceedings for the selection of the 2009 [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n===Community initiatives===\nIn a bid to preserve Silbo Gomero for the island's youth, expert whistlers sought to obtain authorization, which enabled them to teach the language on a free and voluntary basis at a dedicated centre. This initiative by the senior islanders garnered encouraging responses, with parent-teacher associations extending it to all schools. The first of many revitalization measures was thus adopted at the [[grassroots]] level, not by public or private entities, which reflected the language attitude of locals towards Silbo Gomero. Education policies which were implemented later were inspired as such - revitalization began at the grassroots and escalated to the highest government bodies.\n\n===Government policies===\nOn 26 June 1997,<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> the Parliament of the Canary Islands approved a motion calling on the government to include Silbo Gomero as part of school curriculum. Silbo Gomero then became a mandatory subject in primary and secondary education, as of  July 1999. The provincial government was supportive in its implementation of education policy and also the establishment of a formalized Silbo Gomero curriculum through the publication of ''El Silbo Gomero, Materiales did\u00e1cticos'' (Educational Materials on the Silbo Gomero).\n\nIn addition to the compulsory learning of Silbo Gomero at the primary and secondary level, an Island School of Silbo Gomero was established for post-secondary students who wish to continue to train in Silbo Gomero until they become accredited professional instructors. Students of the Island School work to become capable of teaching Silbo Gomero to not only their fellow citizens, but also tourists who visit La Gomera. This facilitates the sustainability of the revitalization and also works towards language maintenance.\n\nThereafter, the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sport of the Canary Islands developed a staff training plan in order to ensure that the elderly expert whistlers can be replaced in the near future by qualified professional teachers with relevant diplomas. This comprised training courses on proficiency in and teaching of Silbo Gomero. The training plan was launched in 2007, with the participation of 18 teachers.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nBesides the implementation of education policies, the authorities also sought to strengthen the corpus of Silbo Gomero by developing a project to digitize all recorded audio material. Local, national and worldwide distribution of documentaries on Silbo Gomero were also made. The government also raised the status of Silbo Gomero by selecting the whistled language of La Gomera via the National Historical Heritage Council to represent Spain in the nominations for inclusion on the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\n===Cultural heritage===\nMembers of the Gomeran community treasure Silbo Gomero  as part of the island's identity and use the whistled language in traditional rituals and festivities on the island. One of these includes \"bajadas\", which are processions dedicated to the Virgin or the patron saints of the community. \nOn 15 March 1999,<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> Silbo Gomero was declared as part of the historical ethnographic heritage of the Canary Islands.  The annual celebration of \u201cSchool Encounters with Silbo Gomero\u201d was also inaugurated in La Gomera. In 2005, the monument to Silbo Gomero was inducted in [[Garajonay National Park]].\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Demostraci\u00f3n de silbo gomero, La Gomera, Espa\u00f1a, 2012-12-14, DD 01.jpg|thumb|x200px|right|Silbo Gomero demonstration at a restaurant in La Gomera.]] Silbo Gomero is not only used between Gomerans; visitors to the island have the opportunity to be exposed to the whistled language too, in restaurants which provide whistling demonstrations for tourists. Minister of Tourism of La Gomera, Fernando Mendez, asserted that whistling is essential to the tourism industry of La Gomera.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20953138|title=Silbo Gomero: A whistling language revived|work=[[BBC News]]|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n{{Listen |filename=Silbo.ogg|left|title=A dialogue in Silbo Gomero}}\n\nAccording to different studies, the Silbo Gomero Language has between 2<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> and 4<ref name=\"Meyer\"/><ref name=\"meyer_2008\"/><ref name=\"Trujillo_Ortiz_2005\"/> vowels and between 4<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> and 10<ref name=\"Meyer\"/><ref name=\"Annie\" /> consonants.\nThe language is a whistled form of a dialect of Spanish.<ref>Busnel, Classe, p54 ff</ref> Silbo replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound. Whistles are distinguished according to pitch and continuity. As with other whistled forms of non-tonal languages, Silbo works by retaining approximately the articulation of ordinary speech, so \"the timbre variations of speech appear in the guise of pitch variations\" (Busnel and Classe: v).\n\nSilbo Gomero is a complex language to learn, with its whistling techniques requiring physical precision, and a strength of the body parts used in mechanism of the language, that can only be acquired with practice. Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips and hands of the users, differing greatly from conventional language, which uses the mouth cavity to blend and contrast several acoustic frequencies. The whistling mechanism, in contrast, is limited to only emitting a single basic pitch between 1,000 and 3,000 hertz.\nThe physical precision comes in the skill of the whistler being able to vary the frequencies at different speeds and to start and stop the production of the sound waves. \nThis technique is handed down within La Gomera's community, with unchanged teaching methods that date back to the late nineteenth century.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\nThe same pitch can represent many sounds, so it has much fewer phonemes than Spanish. This means that communication in Silbo can be ambiguous at times. Context and appropriate choice of words are thus important for effective communication.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Pereira\n | first =Diana \n | title = Silbo Gomero, a language of whistles\n | date =18 July 2013\n | url = http://termcoord.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/silbo-gomero-a-language-of-whistles/\n | accessdate = 10 October 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowels of Silbo Gomero are described roughly as sustained lines of high and low frequency that are distinct from each other. \n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Vowels\n!

Despite Trujillo's 2005 work acknowledging the existence of 4 vowels, his 2006 bilingual work (\"''El Silbo Gomero. Nuevo estudio fonol\u00f3gico''\") inexplicably reiterates his 1978 two-vowel theory. Trujillo's 2006 work directly addresses many of Rialland's conclusions, but it seems that at the time of that writing he was unaware of Meyer's work.\n\nMeyer suggests that there are 4 vowel classes of {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/u, o/}}. However Meyer goes on to say that there are 5 perceived vowels with significant overlap. \nRialland (2005) and Trujillo (1978) both agree that the [[harmonic]] of the whistle matches the second [[formant]] of the spoken vowels. Spoken {{IPA|/a/}}'s F2 and whistled {{IPA|/a/}}'s H1 match in their frequency (1480&nbsp;Hz). However, there is a disconnect in harmonics and formants near the frequency basement. Spoken speech has a wide range of F2 frequencies (790&nbsp;Hz to 2300&nbsp;Hz), whistles are limited to between 1200&nbsp;Hz and 2400&nbsp;Hz. Vowels are therefore shifted upwards at the lower end (maintaining 1480&nbsp;Hz as {{IPA|/a/}}) increasing confusion between {{IPA|/o/}} (spoken F2  freq 890&nbsp;Hz, whistled <1300&nbsp;Hz) and {{IPA|/u/}} (spoken freq 790&nbsp;Hz, Whistled <<1300&nbsp;Hz). In whistling the frequency basement must be raised to the minimum whistle harmonic of 1000&nbsp;Hz reducing frequency spacing in the vowels, which increases misidentification in the lower vowels.\n\n===Consonants===\nConsonants in Silbo Gomero are modifications of the vowel-based \u201cmelody line\u201d or \u201cvocal line\u201d. They may be rising or falling or can also be modified by being broken, continuous or occlusive. The four main consonants in the now largely debunked and disproven 1978 analysis were wrongly listed as follows:<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\n\n{| border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants\n!

Trujillo (1978) suggested that the consonants are either rises or dips in the \"melody line\" which can be broken or continuous.\nFurther investigation by Meyer and by Rialland suggest that vowels are stripped to their inherent class of sound which is communicated in the whistle in these ways: voice ({{IPA|/k/}} vs {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) is transmitted by the whistled feature [-[[continuant|continuity]]]. A silent pause in the whistle communicates [+[[voice (phonetics)|voice]]] ({{IPA|/\u0261/}}), while a [+continuous] consonant gives the quality [-voice] ({{IPA|/k/}}). Placement of the consonant ([[dental consonant|dental]], [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[fricative]]) is transmitted in whistle by the loci, the sharpness or speed, of the formant transitions between vowels. Consonant classes are simplified into four classes. Extra high loci (near vertical formant loci) denotes [[affricates]] and stridents, rising loci denotes [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], medial (loci just above the vowel formant) denotes [[palatal]], and falling (low loci) denotes [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], and [[fricative]]. This gives 8 whistled consonants, but including tone gradual decay (with intensity falling off) as a feature on continuous and interrupted sounds gives 10 consonants. In these situations gradual decay is given [+voice], and continuous is given [+[[liquid consonant|liquid]]].<ref name=\"Meyer\" /><ref name=\"Annie\" /><sub>chart requested?</sub>\n\nThe representation of {{IPA|/s/}} is actually treated as a broken high pitch when whistled in Silbo. However, in the spoken language, {{IPA|/s/}} is a continuous high pitch consonant. There are two reasons for this anomaly. Firstly, in functional terms, the {{IPA|/s/}} consonant is high in frequency, thus being extremely useful. Secondly, as the continuous high-pitched consonant of Silbo already represents many other consonants of the spoken language ({{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/\u027e/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u029d/}}), it would be very confusing to add on to the extensive list. Thus, as the broken high-pitched consonant does not fully represent {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}, it can be used to represent the frequently used {{IPA|/s/}} consonant.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\n\n===Cognitive features===\nStudies have shown that Silbo Gomero speakers process the whistled register in the same way as the standard spoken language. Studies carried out by Manuel Carreiras of the [[University of La Laguna]] and David Corina of the [[University of Washington]] published research on Silbo in 2004 and 2005. Their study involved two participant groups of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers. One group of Spanish speakers \u201cspoke\u201d Silbo, while the other group did not. Results obtained from monitoring the participants' brain activity by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have shown that while non-speakers of Silbo merely processed Silbo as whistling, speakers of Silbo processed the whistling sounds in the same linguistic centers of the brain that processed Spanish sentences.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carreiras M, Lopez J, Rivero F, Corina D | title=Linguistic perception: neural processing of a whistled language | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | issue=7021 | year=2005 | pages=31\u201332 | pmid=15635400 | doi=10.1038/433031a}}</ref>\n\n==Others==\nFilm maker and photographer Francesca Phillips wrote and directed a [[documentary]] on the usage of Silbo Gomero in La Gomera titled \u201cWritten in the Wind\u201d (2009) and this 26min film won Best Short Documentary in [[Anthropology]] at The World Mountain Documentary Festival held in [[Qinghai]], [[China]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|title=The Francesca Phillips Written in the Wind|publisher=Francesca Phillips|date=2010|access-date=15 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020163558/http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|archive-date=20 October 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nRomanian filmmaker [[Corneliu Porumboiu]] directed the 2019 movie ''[[The Whistlers (film)|The Whistlers]]'', in which the language is featured prominently.\n\nFrench singer F\u00e9loche dedicated a song to this traditional singing called Silbo.\n\nThere are other examples of transposition of an oral natural language into a pitch string.

The language's earlier survival had been due to its role in overcoming distance and terrain, in addition to the ease with which it is learned by native speakers.<ref name=\"Busnel, Classe, p 8\"/> Most significantly, in the period from the 1960s to 1980s, many people had turned away from [[agriculture]] and so many [[middle class]] families did not want their children to speak the language as it was negatively associated with the rural [[peasants]].\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[language revitalization]] efforts began and initiatives from within the community started. By 1999, the revitalization of Silbo Gomero was furthered by [[education policies]] and other legislative measures. It now has official protection as an example of [[intangible cultural heritage]].\n\n==Speakers==\nMany people in La Gomera speak Silbo Gomero, but their expression of the language deviates in minor ways which show the different origins of the speaker. As reported in a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, all the people living in La Gomera understand the language, but only those born before 1950 and the younger generations who attended school since 1999 can speak the language.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00172 |title= Whistled language of the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands), the Silbo Gomero |publisher= Fourth Session of the Intergovernmental Committee 2009 (4.COM)|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Those born before 1950 were taught the language by their elders in their homes, and those who have attended or are attending school since 1999 were taught the language formally in school. Those born between 1950 and 1980 understand the language but are unable to speak it, as the language was hardly used and negatively viewed during their time of [[language acquisition]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Revitalization==\nWhen this medium of communication was endangered  in the late 20th century, [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] efforts were generated at both community level and governmental level. A combination of initiatives from the La Gomeran community and policies implemented by the authorities saw Silbo Gomero being revitalized and maintained as a cultural asset. These revitalization efforts were well-documented by UNESCO as part of the proceedings for the selection of the 2009 [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n===Community initiatives===\nIn a bid to preserve Silbo Gomero for the island\u2019s youth, expert whistlers sought to obtain authorization, which enabled them to teach the language on a free and voluntary basis at a dedicated centre. This initiative by the senior islanders garnered encouraging responses, with parent-teacher associations extending it to all schools. The first of many revitalization measures was thus adopted at the [[grassroots]] level, not by public or private entities, which reflected the language attitude of locals towards Silbo Gomero. Education policies which were implemented later were inspired as such - revitalization began at the grassroots and escalated to the highest government bodies.\n\n===Government policies===\nOn 26 June 1997,<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> the Parliament of the Canary Islands approved a motion calling on the government to include Silbo Gomero as part of school curriculum. Silbo Gomero then became a mandatory subject in primary and secondary education, as of  July 1999. The provincial government was supportive in its implementation of education policy and also the establishment of a formalized Silbo Gomero curriculum through the publication of ''El Silbo Gomero, Materiales did\u00e1cticos'' (Educational Materials on the Silbo Gomero).\n\nIn addition to the compulsory learning of Silbo Gomero at the primary and secondary level, an Island School of Silbo Gomero was established for post-secondary students who wish to continue to train in Silbo Gomero until they become accredited professional instructors. Students of the Island School work to become capable of teaching Silbo Gomero to not only their fellow citizens, but also tourists who visit La Gomera. This facilitates the sustainability of the revitalization and also works towards language maintenance.\n\nThereafter, the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sport of the Canary Islands developed a staff training plan in order to ensure that the elderly expert whistlers can be replaced in the near future by qualified professional teachers with relevant diplomas. This comprised training courses on proficiency in and teaching of Silbo Gomero. The training plan was launched in 2007, with the participation of 18 teachers.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nBesides the implementation of education policies, the authorities also sought to strengthen the corpus of Silbo Gomero by developing a project to digitize all recorded audio material. Local, national and worldwide distribution of documentaries on Silbo Gomero were also made. The government also raised the status of Silbo Gomero by selecting the whistled language of La Gomera via the National Historical Heritage Council to represent Spain in the nominations for inclusion on the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\n===Cultural heritage===\nMembers of the Gomeran community treasure Silbo Gomero  as part of the island\u2019s identity and use the whistled language in traditional rituals and festivities on the island. One of these includes \"bajadas\", which are processions dedicated to the Virgin or the patron saints of the community. \nOn 15 March 1999,<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> Silbo Gomero was declared as part of the historical ethnographic heritage of the Canary Islands.  The annual celebration of \u201cSchool Encounters with Silbo Gomero\u201d was also inaugurated in La Gomera. In 2005, the monument to Silbo Gomero was inducted in [[Garajonay National Park]].\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Demostraci\u00f3n de silbo gomero, La Gomera, Espa\u00f1a, 2012-12-14, DD 01.jpg|thumb|x200px|right|Silbo Gomero demonstration at a restaurant in La Gomera.]] Silbo Gomero is not only used between Gomerans; visitors to the island have the opportunity to be exposed to the whistled language too, in restaurants which provide whistling demonstrations for tourists. Minister of Tourism of La Gomera, Fernando Mendez, asserted that whistling is essential to the tourism industry of La Gomera.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20953138|title=Silbo Gomero: A whistling language revived|work=[[BBC News]]|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n{{Listen |filename=Silbo.ogg|left|title=A dialogue in Silbo Gomero}}\n\nAccording to different studies, the Silbo Gomero Language has between 2<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> and 4<ref name=\"Meyer\"/><ref name=\"meyer_2008\"/><ref name=\"Trujillo_Ortiz_2005\"/> vowels and between 4<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> and 10<ref name=\"Meyer\"/><ref name=\"Annie\" /> consonants.\nThe language is a whistled form of a dialect of Spanish.<ref>Busnel, Classe, p54 ff</ref> Silbo replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound. Whistles are distinguished according to pitch and continuity. As with other whistled forms of non-tonal languages, Silbo works by retaining approximately the articulation of ordinary speech, so \"the timbre variations of speech appear in the guise of pitch variations\" (Busnel and Classe: v).\n\nSilbo Gomero is a complex language to learn, with its whistling techniques requiring physical precision, and a strength of the body parts used in mechanism of the language, that can only be acquired with practice. Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips and hands of the users, differing greatly from conventional language, which uses the mouth cavity to blend and contrast several acoustic frequencies. The whistling mechanism, in contrast, is limited to only emitting a single basic pitch between 1,000 and 3,000 hertz.\nThe physical precision comes in the skill of the whistler being able to vary the frequencies at different speeds and to start and stop the production of the sound waves. \nThis technique is handed down within La Gomera\u2019s community, with unchanged teaching methods that date back to the late nineteenth century.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\nThe same pitch can represent many sounds, so it has much fewer phonemes than Spanish. This means that communication in Silbo can be ambiguous at times. Context and appropriate choice of words are thus important for effective communication.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Pereira\n | first =Diana \n | title = Silbo Gomero, a language of whistles\n | date =18 July 2013\n | url = http://termcoord.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/silbo-gomero-a-language-of-whistles/\n | accessdate = 10 October 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowels of Silbo Gomero are described roughly as sustained lines of high and low frequency that are distinct from each other. \n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Vowels\n!

Despite Trujillo's 2005 work acknowledging the existence of 4 vowels, his 2006 bilingual work (\"''El Silbo Gomero. Nuevo estudio fonol\u00f3gico''\") inexplicably reiterates his 1978 two-vowel theory. Trujillo's 2006 work directly addresses many of Rialland's conclusions, but it seems that at the time of that writing he was unaware of Meyer's work.\n\nMeyer suggests that there are 4 vowel classes of {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/u, o/}}. However Meyer goes on to say that there are 5 perceived vowels with significant overlap. \nRialland (2005) and Trujillo (1978) both agree that the [[harmonic]] of the whistle matches the second [[formant]] of the spoken vowels. Spoken {{IPA|/a/}}'s F2 and whistled {{IPA|/a/}}'s H1 match in their frequency (1480&nbsp;Hz). However, there is a disconnect in harmonics and formants near the frequency basement. Spoken speech has a wide range of F2 frequencies (790&nbsp;Hz to 2300&nbsp;Hz), whistles are limited to between 1200&nbsp;Hz and 2400&nbsp;Hz. Vowels are therefore shifted upwards at the lower end (maintaining 1480&nbsp;Hz as {{IPA|/a/}}) increasing confusion between {{IPA|/o/}} (spoken F2  freq 890&nbsp;Hz, whistled <1300&nbsp;Hz) and {{IPA|/u/}} (spoken freq 790&nbsp;Hz, Whistled <<1300&nbsp;Hz). In whistling the frequency basement must be raised to the minimum whistle harmonic of 1000&nbsp;Hz reducing frequency spacing in the vowels, which increases misidentification in the lower vowels.\n\n===Consonants===\nConsonants in Silbo Gomero are modifications of the vowel-based \u201cmelody line\u201d or \u201cvocal line\u201d.

Trujillo (1978) suggested that the consonants are either rises or dips in the \"melody line\" which can be broken or continuous.\nFurther investigation by Meyer and by Rialland suggest that vowels are stripped to their inherent class of sound which is communicated in the whistle in these ways: voice ({{IPA|/k/}} vs {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) is transmitted by the whistled feature [-[[continuant|continuity]]]. A silent pause in the whistle communicates [+[[voice (phonetics)|voice]]] ({{IPA|/\u0261/}}), while a [+continuous] consonant gives the quality [-voice] ({{IPA|/k/}}). Placement of the consonant ([[dental consonant|dental]], [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[fricative]]) is transmitted in whistle by the loci, the sharpness or speed, of the formant transitions between vowels. Consonant classes are simplified into four classes. Extra high loci (near vertical formant loci) denotes [[affricates]] and stridents, rising loci denotes [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], medial (loci just above the vowel formant) denotes [[palatal]], and falling (low loci) denotes [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], and [[fricative]]. This gives 8 whistled consonants, but including tone gradual decay (with intensity falling off) as a feature on continuous and interrupted sounds gives 10 consonants. In these situations gradual decay is given [+voice], and continuous is given [+[[liquid consonant|liquid]]].<ref name=\"Meyer\" /><ref name=\"Annie\" /><sub>chart requested?</sub>\n\nThe representation of {{IPA|/s/}} is actually treated as a broken high pitch when whistled in Silbo. However, in the spoken language, {{IPA|/s/}} is a continuous high pitch consonant. There are two reasons for this anomaly. Firstly, in functional terms, the {{IPA|/s/}} consonant is high in frequency, thus being extremely useful. Secondly, as the continuous high-pitched consonant of Silbo already represents many other consonants of the spoken language ({{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/\u027e/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u029d/}}), it would be very confusing to add on to the extensive list. Thus, as the broken high-pitched consonant does not fully represent {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}, it can be used to represent the frequently used {{IPA|/s/}} consonant.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\n\n===Cognitive features===\nStudies have shown that Silbo Gomero speakers process the whistled register in the same way as the standard spoken language. Studies carried out by Manuel Carreiras of the [[University of La Laguna]] and David Corina of the [[University of Washington]] published research on Silbo in 2004 and 2005. Their study involved two participant groups of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers. One group of Spanish speakers \u201cspoke\u201d Silbo, while the other group did not. Results obtained from monitoring the participants' brain activity by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have shown that while non-speakers of Silbo merely processed Silbo as whistling, speakers of Silbo processed the whistling sounds in the same linguistic centers of the brain that processed Spanish sentences.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carreiras M, Lopez J, Rivero F, Corina D | title=Linguistic perception: neural processing of a whistled language | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | issue=7021 | year=2005 | pages=31\u201332 | pmid=15635400 | doi=10.1038/433031a}}</ref>\n\n==Others==\nFilm maker and photographer Francesca Phillips wrote and directed a [[documentary]] on the usage of Silbo Gomero in La Gomera titled \u201cWritten in the Wind\u201d (2009) and this 26min film won Best Short Documentary in [[Anthropology]] at The World Mountain Documentary Festival held in [[Qinghai]], [[China]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|title=The Francesca Phillips Written in the Wind|publisher=Francesca Phillips|date=2010|access-date=15 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020163558/http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|archive-date=20 October 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nRomanian filmmaker [[Corneliu Porumboiu]] directed the 2019 movie ''[[The Whistlers (film)|The Whistlers]]'', in which the language is featured prominently.\n\nFrench singer F\u00e9loche dedicated a song to this traditional singing called Silbo.\n\nThere are other examples of transposition of an oral natural language into a pitch string.

Despite also being the youngest member of the team, he is appointed the leader as he was chosen by the strongest Kiramai Stone, much to his initial dismay before he eventually settled into the role. When he first met the Kiramagers, Juru knew everyone except for Tametomo based on their fame. Due in part to his love of drawing, he gained the Kiramental to create virtually anything after becoming Kiramai Red, such as reformatting the Kiramai Stones into the Kiramai Mashin and granting them the ability to combine.<!--Interestingly enough, he had visions of Crystalia and Yodonheim before Mabushina found him, suggesting a possible connection to the former.-->\n: Juru Atsuta is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Rio Komiya]]|\u5c0f\u5bae \u7483\u592e|Komiya Rio}}.\n;{{nihongo|Tametomo Imizu|\u5c04\u6c34 \u70ba\u671d|Imizu Tametomo}}<ref>https://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/kiramager/character/yellow.html</ref>\n: An [[esports]] professional who excels in long range combat and transforms into {{nihongo|Kiramai Yellow|\u30ad\u30e9\u30e1\u30a4\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Kiramei Ier\u014d}}. He acts as an older brother figure and provides assistance when needed. However, he is also a selfish egotist, seeing himself as the Kiramagers' \"ace\" even when the others disagree. After Juru failed to recognize him, Tametomo developed an antagonistic relationship with him, questioning his every move and talking back to him every so often. This came to a head when a jealous Shovellow convinced Tametomo to take Juru's position away from him, only to get suspended for botching a mission. Though he quit out of anger, the girls helped Tametomo realize he never wanted the leadership role anyway and that Juru was always more qualified in the first place. Once he reconciled with the others, Muryo named Tametomo second-in-command of the Kiramagers and granted him the authority to lead should anything happen to Juru.\n: Tametomo Imizu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Rui Kihara|\u6728\u539f \u7460\u751f|Kihara Rui}}.

Despite being a popular stuntman, most of his fans are annoyed by his doll-like personality as he rarely shows emotion. While he likes to maintain an air of stoicism and coldness, he only does so to contain his true feelings and not be a burden to everyone around him as he believes a hero should suffer in silence.

The \"Shu\" name derives from the main base of operations at the time, namely the [[Sichuan]] region of China. Today, the Shu School has many branches and lineages, most of which trace their foundation to Zhang Kongshan, though the term is equally applied to Sichuan-based players in general.<ref>Zhang (2005), p. 151.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Sichuan qin players, as early as the [[Tang Dynasty]], was perceived as having qin play characterised by rushing, tumbling energy.\n\n===Zhang Kongshan===\nThe modern form of the school was largely founded by Zhang Kongshan in the mid-19th century; his inheritors have been very numerous.\n\nAs the Sichuan style fanned out into other areas of China (as it seemed to do rather successfully in the early 20th century), it became known as \"Fanchuan\", whose connotation is something like \"Chuan \u2013 Everywhere\".\n\n==Name nomenclature==\nThere is a debate as to whether the \"Shu\" (\u8700) appellation is an accurate designation for the school/style in question. Some people prefer \"Chuan\" (\u5ddd) as this distinguishes it from the old historical \"Shu School\" which is totally unrelated to the modern guise. \"Fanchuan\" (\u6cdb\u5ddd) gained credence after being coined by [[Zha Fuxi]] and is applied generally to any Shu style player not residing in Sichuan but has generally been applied indiscriminately, even to players with little association or connection with Sichuan or the modern Shu School in general.\n\nPresently, the only players to use the \"Shu\" appellation are from the main branches of the Zhang Kongshan lineage, especially the Ye branch, e.g. [[Zeng Chengwei]]. \"Chuan\" is generally used by players not of the main Zhang Kongshan lineage but residing roughly in the Sichuan area or have connections with it.\n\n==Style==\nHistorically, the Shu style is described in literature as \"restlessly fast and unrestrained, with magnificence of momentum\" (\u8e81\u6025\u5954\u653e\u3001\u6c23\u52e2\u5b8f\u5049). This is due to the nature of the environment which Sichuan is, with high mountains, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers, which are the main influences for the players and composers of the music.\n\n==Melodies and Qinpu==\nThe magnum opus and foundation document of the modern Shu School is the ''Tianwen Ge Qinpu'' (\u5929\u805e\u95a3\u7434\u8b5c, \"Qin Codex of the Pavilion of Heavenly Sounds\"), published in 1876 under the auspices of Zhang Kongshan and his associate, Tang Yiming, and his student, Ye Jiefu.<ref>Zhang (2005), pp. 151-152.</ref> The ''Tianwen Ge'' is not only the largest collection of qin melodies ever published in a single publication currently in existence but also it contains many other useful data related to qin lore and construction. Most of the melodies were in the active repertoire of his students and came from many sources. Some were compositions whilst around nine melodies were edited and rearranged by Zhang during his years in Sichuan. Out of these nine, the most influential melody was that of \"Liu Shui\" (\u6d41\u6c34) or \"Flowing Water\".\n\n==Branches==\nThere are two branches: one branch through Ye Jiafu whose lineage is embodied by Zeng Chengwei, and the other is through Gu Yucheng whose lineage was embodied by Gu Meigeng.<ref>Tang (2013), pp.\n 288-290.</ref> Other than those two main branches, there are others such as the \"Ba Lineage\" which is not a direct line from Zhang Kongshan.<ref>Yang (2013), pp. 61-65.</ref>\n\n===Lineage tree===\nBelow is a construction of the lines and branches<ref>This 'family tree' was constructed from information in the works by Zhang (2005) p. 154, and Li (2015) pp. 136-138, together with essays in compilations edited by Zeng (2014), Yang (2013) and Tang (2013).</ref> from the transmission of Zhang Kongshan.

The \"Shu\" name derives from the main base of operations at the time, namely the [[Sichuan]] region of China. Today, the Shu School has many branches and lineages, most of which trace their foundation to Zhang Kongshan, though the term is equally applied to Sichuan-based players in general.<ref>Zhang (2005), p. 151.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Sichuan qin players, as early as the [[Tang Dynasty]], was perceived as having qin play characterised by rushing, tumbling energy.\n\n===Zhang Kongshan===\nThe modern form of the school was largely founded by Zhang Kongshan in the mid-19th century; his inheritors have been very numerous.\n\nAs the Sichuan style fanned out into other areas of China (as it seemed to do rather successfully in the early 20th century), it became known as \"Fanchuan\", whose connotation is something like \"Chuan \u2013 Everywhere\".\n\n==Name nomenclature==\nThere is a debate as to whether the \"Shu\" (\u8700) appellation is an accurate designation for the school/style in question. Some people prefer \"Chuan\" (\u5ddd) as this distinguishes it from the old historical \"Shu School\" which is totally unrelated to the modern guise. \"Fanchuan\" (\u6cdb\u5ddd) gained credence after being coined by [[Zha Fuxi]] and is applied generally to any Shu style player not residing in Sichuan but has generally been applied indiscriminately, even to players with little association or connection with Sichuan or the modern Shu School in general.\n\nPresently, the only players to use the \"Shu\" appellation are from the main branches of the Zhang Kongshan lineage, especially the Ye branch, e.g. [[Zeng Chengwei]]. \"Chuan\" is generally used by players not of the main Zhang Kongshan lineage but residing roughly in the Sichuan area or have connections with it.\n\n==Style==\nHistorically, the Shu style is described in literature as \"restlessly fast and unrestrained, with magnificence of momentum\" (\u8e81\u6025\u5954\u653e\u3001\u6c23\u52e2\u5b8f\u5049). This is due to the nature of the environment which Sichuan is, with high mountains, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers, which are the main influences for the players and composers of the music.\n\n==Melodies and Qinpu==\nThe magnum opus and foundation document of the modern Shu School is the ''Tianwen Ge Qinpu'' (\u5929\u805e\u95a3\u7434\u8b5c, \"Qin Codex of the Pavilion of Heavenly Sounds\"), published in 1876 under the auspices of Zhang Kongshan and his associate, Tang Yiming, and his student, Ye Jiefu.<ref>Zhang (2005), pp. 151-152.</ref> The ''Tianwen Ge'' is not only the largest collection of qin melodies ever published in a single publication currently in existence but also it contains many other useful data related to qin lore and construction. Most of the melodies were in the active repertoire of his students and came from many sources. Some were compositions whilst around nine melodies were edited and rearranged by Zhang during his years in Sichuan. Out of these nine, the most influential melody was that of \"Liu Shui\" (\u6d41\u6c34) or \"Flowing Water\".\n\n==Branches==\nThere are two branches: one branch through Ye Jiafu whose lineage is embodied by Zeng Chengwei, and the other is through Gu Yucheng whose lineage was embodied by Gu Meigeng.<ref>Tang (2013), pp.\n 288-290.</ref> Other than those two main branches, there are others such as the \"Ba Lineage\" which is not a direct line from Zhang Kongshan.<ref>Yang (2013), pp. 61-65.</ref>\n\n===Lineage tree===\nBelow is a construction of the lines and branches<ref>This 'family tree' was constructed from information in the works by Zhang (2005) p. 154, and Li (2015) pp. 136-138, together with essays in compilations edited by Zeng (2014), Yang (2013) and Tang (2013).</ref> from the transmission of Zhang Kongshan.

Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint this morning in Ramsey County.<ref name =Collins>Olson, Michael, [http://live.mprnews.org/Event/The_shooting_death_of_Philando_Castile ''The latest: The shooting death of Philando Castile''] [[Minnesota Public Radio]], November 16, 2016.</ref></blockquote>In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who was standing at the car's passenger window during the shooting, \"did not touch or remove his gun from its holster\",&nbsp;and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez \"stated he did not know where [Castile's] gun was\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Choi also noted that:\n* \"Philando Castile was not resisting or fleeing.\"\n* \"There was absolutely no criminal intent exhibited by him throughout this encounter.\"\n* \"He was respectful and compliant based upon the instructions and orders he was given.\"\n* \"He volunteered in good faith that he had a firearm \u2013 beyond what the law requires.\"\n* \"He emphatically stated that he wasn't pulling it out.\"\n* \"His movement was restricted by his own seat belt.\"\n* \"He was accompanied, in his vehicle, by a woman and a young child.\"\n* \"Philando Castile did not exhibit any intent, nor did he have any reason, to shoot Officer Yanez.\"\n* \"In fact, his dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to author and former FBI agent Larry Brubaker, who has written two books on officer-involved shootings, \"this is the first time an officer has been charged for a fatal shooting in Minnesota in more than 200 cases that spanned over three decades\".<ref name = Collins2>Collins, Jon, [http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/11/16/officer-charged-in-castile-shooting Officer charged in ''Castile shooting''], Minnesota Public Radio, November 16, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Trial and verdict ===\n[[File:Valerie Castile photo by Lorie Shaull 2.jpg|thumb|Philando's mother, Valerie Castile, speaking at a press conference shortly after the verdict was announced]]\nThe trial of Jeronimo Yanez began May 30, 2017, under Judge William H.

Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint this morning in Ramsey County.<ref name =Collins>Olson, Michael, [http://live.mprnews.org/Event/The_shooting_death_of_Philando_Castile ''The latest: The shooting death of Philando Castile''] [[Minnesota Public Radio]], November 16, 2016.</ref></blockquote>In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who was standing at the car's passenger window during the shooting, \"did not touch or remove his gun from its holster\",&nbsp;and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez \"stated he did not know where [Castile's] gun was\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Choi also noted that:\n* \"Philando Castile was not resisting or fleeing.\"\n* \"There was absolutely no criminal intent exhibited by him throughout this encounter.\"\n* \"He was respectful and compliant based upon the instructions and orders he was given.\"\n* \"He volunteered in good faith that he had a firearm \u2013 beyond what the law requires.\"\n* \"He emphatically stated that he wasn't pulling it out.\"\n* \"His movement was restricted by his own seat belt.\"\n* \"He was accompanied, in his vehicle, by a woman and a young child.\"\n* \"Philando Castile did not exhibit any intent, nor did he have any reason, to shoot Officer Yanez.\"\n* \"In fact, his dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to author and former FBI agent Larry Brubaker, who has written two books on officer-involved shootings, \"this is the first time an officer has been charged for a fatal shooting in Minnesota in more than 200 cases that spanned over three decades\".<ref name = Collins2>Collins, Jon, [http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/11/16/officer-charged-in-castile-shooting Officer charged in ''Castile shooting''], Minnesota Public Radio, November 16, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Trial and verdict ===\n[[File:Valerie Castile photo by Lorie Shaull 2.jpg|thumb|Philando's mother, Valerie Castile, speaking at a press conference shortly after the verdict was announced]]\nThe trial of Jeronimo Yanez began May 30, 2017, under Judge William H.
