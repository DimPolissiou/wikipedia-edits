A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Smith was a member of the [[Florida Senate]] from [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] from 2001 until 2006. Smith ran for the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]] but lost to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Congressman Jim Davis]]. In 2010, Smith was the Democratic nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida]] as the running mate of [[Alex Sink]] in her [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2010|campaign for Governor of Florida]]. From November 2010 through January 2013 Smith served as chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/08/2007216/smith-tapped-as-chairman-for-florida.html Miami Herald: Rod Smith tapped as chairman for Florida Democrats]</ref> In 2016, Smith again ran for a seat in the Florida Senate but was ultimately defeated by [[Keith Perry (politician)|Keith Perry]], a Republican and former state representative. \n\n==Early life and education==\nSmith was born on November 15, 1949, in [[Southwest City, Missouri|Southwest City]], [[Missouri]], just across the state line from his family's home in [[Oklahoma]]. Before he reached the age of two, Smith's family moved to Florida, where they grew [[eggplant]] and [[Bell pepper|green peppers]]. Smith attended public schools. He attended the [[University of Tulsa]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1971. While at the University of Tulsa, he was a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]] graduating with a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] in 1975.\n\n==Legal and political career==\nFollowing his admission to [[The Florida Bar]], Smith worked for the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission for two years, representing the state in cases relating to [[labor law]]. After two years in [[Tallahassee]], Smith returned to [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua County]] and spent the next 15 years in private practice. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' later wrote that, since that time, Smith has \"crisscrossed Florida, representing an array of [[Trade union|labor unions]]&ndash;[[police officer]]s and [[firefighter]]s, [[Electrician|electrical workers]], [[carpenter]]s, [[Painter and decorator|painters]] and pipe fitters. He argued on behalf of large vegetable farmers and dairies and nurserymen. He won settlements against the likes of [[DuPont]] and, occasionally, represented criminal defendants...He established himself as a skillful litigator.\"{{ref|Privatepractice}}\n\nIn 1992, Smith was recruited by a group of county sheriffs to seek the office of State Attorney for the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida. Smith defeated incumbent Len Register that same year and, during his first term, successfully prosecuted [[serial killer]] [[Danny Rolling]], the \"Gainesville Ripper.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Re-elected in 1996, Smith created the circuit's first special prosecutions unit, which dealt with crimes against women and children, and created an [[environmental crime]] unit. He was succeeded by Bill Cervone to be State Attorney.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Smith was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] as a Democrat. He represented the 14th Senate district, which included nine counties in northern Florida, centered around Gainesville and Ocala. While in the Senate, Smith served as chair of the Agriculture Committee, as vice chair of the Criminal Justice and Justice Appropriations Committees, and as a member of the Communications and Public Utilities, Environmental Preservation, Rules and Calendar, and Ways and Means Committees, as well as the Legislative Budget Commission.\n\nDuring his term in the Florida Senate, Smith was noted for his work on issues related to criminal justice. He strengthened the state's child abuse laws, fought discrimination in housing and worked to protect the privacy of crime victims. He also improved the state's crime prevention and homeland security initiatives. Smith \"sponsored, and passed, legislation to prevent mentally retarded persons from being executed.\"{{ref|Sentinel}} In 2006, he led the coalition that defeated Governor Jeb Bush's plan to weaken Florida's voter-approved [[Kendrick Meek#Class Size Amendment|class size amendment]] and create a [[school voucher|school voucher program]].\n\nSmith is a partner with the [[law firm]] of [http://www.avera.com Avera & Smith] and also serves as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]] at the University of Florida's Levin College of Law where he teaches [[constitutional law]] and [[trial practice]] and supervises the prosecution clinic. He has also taught at [[Santa Fe Community College]].\n\nThe ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' summed up Smith's biography in this way, \"He comes from a line of struggling farmers and saw [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] as a way out. While in law school at the University of Florida, he juggled going to class with helping to run the family's cattle operation. He won respect from unions as a labor lawyer, got elected state attorney and went on to leadership posts in the Florida Senate.\" {{ref|Beth}}\n\n==2006 election==\nIn January 2005, Smith announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Smith ran against Tampa [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. A statewide poll by the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]], released on August 28, 2006, showed Smith eight points down against Davis. A poll from earlier in the year showed Davis ahead 25 to 9 percent.{{ref|Commercepoll}} Conversely, a July 27 Quinnipiac University poll showed Smith trailing Davis by 28%. However, this poll also revealed that 33% of Democrats were still undecided.\n\nLate in May 2006, U.S. Representatives [[Kendrick Meek]] and [[Allen Boyd]] broke with their fellow Florida Democratic House members to endorse Smith.{{ref|MeekBoyd}} Smith has also been endorsed by former Florida [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] and former state Sen. Tom Rossin, the 2002 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor; state Sen. Dave Aronberg of [[Greenacres, Florida|Greenacres]]; the Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer; and county Commissioner Addie Greene, among others.{{ref|Endorsements}}. The co-chair of his campaign was former governor [[Wayne Mixson]].\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Rod Smith with Reps Meek and Boyd.jpg|thumb|right|360px|U.S. Congressmen Allen Boyd and Kendrick Meek endorsing Rod Smith]] -->\nIn August 2006, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' endorsed Smith, stating that his opponent, \"Davis has a solid record as an ethical, thoughtful state legislator and congressman who understands the challenges facing Florida. Smith combines the same grasp of those challenges with a more dynamic leadership style and a clearer, fresher record of building mainstream coalitions that can successfully carry the day on tough issues. That is what it will take for a Democrat to win in November and successfully govern in Tallahassee.\" {{ref|St.Pete}}\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, saying, \"Rep. Davis would return to Tallahassee with good intentions. Sen. Smith would take office knowing how to get good things done.\" {{ref|Post}} In addition, the ''Lakeland Ledger'' endorsed Smith stating, \"We believe Smith can appeal to a broader segment of the electorate -- that he can muster greater support in the Republican-leaning northern part of the state while still generating strong support in the urban areas of Central and South Florida.\" {{ref|Ledger}}\n\nLater in the month, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' endorsed the Senator, noting that between Smith and Davis, \"Smith's record is the more impressive of the two, and his familiarity with the Legislature and state government gives him the edge over Davis. Smith could literally win the November election and hit the ground running.\" {{ref|Sentinel}}\n\n''[[The Gainesville Sun]]'' also endorsed Smith saying, \"Rod Smith is a superb orator, a skilled negotiator and ...a razor-sharp intellectual and a constitutional scholar who immerses himself in minutia of public policy making .... We think Rod Smith is the Democrat in this race who has the political capital to undo some of the damage that's been done to public education these past eight years, find the right balance between environmental protection and economic growth, protect Florida's fragile water resources and get a handle on the state's runaway health care costs without restricting access to quality care.\" {{ref|Gainesville}}\n\nOn August 27, the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, noting his record of bipartisanship and stating, \"In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of the late [[Lawton Chiles]] to recapture the governor's office.\" {{ref|Herald}}\n\nSmith was criticized by media outlets for his allegedly-passive attitude toward Florida's sugar lobby and their attacks on his primary opponent. In August 2006, the Miami Herald wrote: \"Sen. Smith has been the beneficiary of a million-dollar anti-Davis ad campaign by U.S. Sugar Inc. Senator Smith vows to remain independent. But it could prove difficult to keep a respectable distance from special interests if he becomes beholden to them for outsized political contributions.\" The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which had endorsed Smith, added further criticism. \"What we find most disturbing is the response by state Sen. Rod Smith. Smith, who railed against smear tactics by third-party groups during his state senate campaigns, has consistently failed to rebuke Florida's Working Families (a notable front for Big Sugar interests) for the ads and, when asked, only repeats some of the allegations against Davis. Smith should denounce them.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Rod Smith lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. Davis subsequently lost the election to then Republican [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==2010 Election==\n\nOn August 17, 2010, Rod Smith was announced as the running mate for [[Alex Sink]] on the Democratic ticket for the [[2010 Florida gubernatorial election|race to succeed Crist]], who chose to run for [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|election to the U.S. Senate]] rather than for re-election as governor.{{ref|Sink}} On November 2, the Sink/Smith ticket lost to the Republican Scott/Carroll ticket by a 1% margin.\n\n== 2016 Election ==\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court ordered the drawing of new state senate districts in December 2015, District 8, a newly formed district comprising Alachua County, Putnam County, and the northern half of Marion County opened up. On March 1, 2016, Smith announced<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/203200-rod-smith-makes-state-senate-run-official-with-courthouse-announcement-in-gainesville|title=Rod Smith makes state Senate run official with courthouse announcement in Gainesville - Florida Politics|date=March 1, 2016|work=Florida Politics|access-date=March 22, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> his campaign for the seat against the then third-term Republican state representative Keith Perry. On November 8, Smith lost to Perry with 47.4% of the vote, a 5.2% margin.\n\n==Florida Democratic Party==\n\nIn November 2010 Smith was elected chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]] (FDP), succeeding [[Karen Thurman]] who resigned on November 12, 2010, following the midterm elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013144622/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|url-status=dead|title=Resigned as chair of FDP|archivedate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>  Smith's term expired in January 2013 when he was succeeded by [[Allison Tant]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/26/3202707/allison-tant-wins-race-for-florida.html] The Miami Herald &mdash; Allison Tant wins Race for Florida Democratic chair\", Retrieved June 30, 2013</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*Florida Police Chiefs Association's Legislative Achievement Award (2002)&ndash;for efforts to improve public safety and fight crime\n*Voices of Children Foundation's MVP Leadership Award (2004)&ndash;for efforts on behalf of abused, abandoned and neglected children.\n*[[Florida AFL-CIO]] \"Legislator of the Year\"&ndash;efforts on behalf of organized labor\n\nSmith was also named the \"most effective Democrat in the Florida Senate\" by the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' in 2003.\n\n== Beliefs ==\nSenator Smith is generally regarded as a political moderate and has traditionally taken stances more conservative than the average Democrat. For example, he has received an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA).<sup>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=WFL51166&type=category&category=Gun%2BIssues&go.x=18&go.y=2]</sup> Still, during the first televised debate of the 2006 Democratic primary, Smith stated that he had \"no problem with a carefully defined assault weapons ban. We want to make sure we don't have weapons in the hands of people who aren't supposed to have them and we have tough laws to prevent that.\" {{ref|guns}} Smith has stated that he supports, and is a principal architect of, legislation requiring [[minors and abortion|parental notification for minors seeking an abortion]] but would \"leave an exception for the health and life of the mother.\" <sup>[http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/6297.article]</sup> Smith describes himself as [[pro-choice]] and his official website promised to, \"veto any legislation that would allow the government more influence over a woman's personal and private decisions regarding her own body.\"<sup>[http://rodsmith2006.com/pages/on_the_issues/#womens]</sup>\n\nOver the course of the 2006 gubernatorial primary, both Smith and his Democratic primary opponent took many positions not generally associated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The latter (Davis) voted for the Iraq War and \"also voted to ban flag-burning.\"  <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/state/15308254.htm]</sup> Both men agreed on [[capital punishment]] and both agreed on having only, as Davis put it, \"some restrictions on assault weapons.\"<sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/sfl-felxdemrail24xaug24,0,6347003.story?coll=sfla-news-florida]</sup>\n\n==Personal life==\nSmith and his wife, DeeDee, live on their farm in Alachua County. As reported in ''Tampa Bay Online'' Smith, \"married Deidra 'DeeDee' Painter, a lawyer .... They have three kids, one together and one each from previous marriages.\" {{ref|TBO}} DeeDee Smith graduated from law school at age 39 and is an attorney and advocate for child abuse victims.{{ref|wives}}\n\nSmith has 1 daughter, Alison Glover, and 2 sons, Jesse Smith and Dylan Smith. He also has, as of January 2018, four grandchildren.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Smith was a member of the [[Florida Senate]] from [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] from 2001 until 2006. Smith ran for the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]] but lost to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Congressman Jim Davis]]. In 2010, Smith was the Democratic nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida]] as the running mate of [[Alex Sink]] in her [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2010|campaign for Governor of Florida]]. From November 2010 through January 2013 Smith served as chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/08/2007216/smith-tapped-as-chairman-for-florida.html Miami Herald: Rod Smith tapped as chairman for Florida Democrats]</ref> In 2016, Smith again ran for a seat in the Florida Senate but was ultimately defeated by [[Keith Perry (politician)|Keith Perry]], a Republican and former state representative. \n\n==Early life and education==\nSmith was born on November 15, 1949, in [[Southwest City, Missouri|Southwest City]], [[Missouri]], just across the state line from his family's home in [[Oklahoma]]. Before he reached the age of two, Smith's family moved to Florida, where they grew [[eggplant]] and [[Bell pepper|green peppers]]. Smith attended public schools. He attended the [[University of Tulsa]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1971. While at the University of Tulsa, he was a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]] graduating with a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] in 1975.\n\n==Legal and political career==\nFollowing his admission to [[The Florida Bar]], Smith worked for the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission for two years, representing the state in cases relating to [[labor law]]. After two years in [[Tallahassee]], Smith returned to [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua County]] and spent the next 15 years in private practice. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' later wrote that, since that time, Smith has \"crisscrossed Florida, representing an array of [[Trade union|labor unions]]&ndash;[[police officer]]s and [[firefighter]]s, [[Electrician|electrical workers]], [[carpenter]]s, [[Painter and decorator|painters]] and pipe fitters. He argued on behalf of large vegetable farmers and dairies and nurserymen. He won settlements against the likes of [[DuPont]] and, occasionally, represented criminal defendants...He established himself as a skillful litigator.\"{{ref|Privatepractice}}\n\nIn 1992, Smith was recruited by a group of county sheriffs to seek the office of State Attorney for the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida. Smith defeated incumbent Len Register that same year and, during his first term, successfully prosecuted [[serial killer]] [[Danny Rolling]], the \"Gainesville Ripper.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Re-elected in 1996, Smith created the circuit's first special prosecutions unit, which dealt with crimes against women and children, and created an [[environmental crime]] unit. He was succeeded by Bill Cervone to be State Attorney.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Smith was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] as a Democrat. He represented the 14th Senate district, which included nine counties in northern Florida, centered around Gainesville and Ocala. While in the Senate, Smith served as chair of the Agriculture Committee, as vice chair of the Criminal Justice and Justice Appropriations Committees, and as a member of the Communications and Public Utilities, Environmental Preservation, Rules and Calendar, and Ways and Means Committees, as well as the Legislative Budget Commission.\n\nDuring his term in the Florida Senate, Smith was noted for his work on issues related to criminal justice. He strengthened the state's child abuse laws, fought discrimination in housing and worked to protect the privacy of crime victims. He also improved the state's crime prevention and homeland security initiatives. Smith \"sponsored, and passed, legislation to prevent mentally retarded persons from being executed.\"{{ref|Sentinel}} In 2006, he led the coalition that defeated Governor Jeb Bush's plan to weaken Florida's voter-approved [[Kendrick Meek#Class Size Amendment|class size amendment]] and create a [[school voucher|school voucher program]].\n\nSmith is a partner with the [[law firm]] of [http://www.avera.com Avera & Smith] and also serves as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]] at the University of Florida's Levin College of Law where he teaches [[constitutional law]] and [[trial practice]] and supervises the prosecution clinic. He has also taught at [[Santa Fe Community College]].\n\nThe ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' summed up Smith's biography in this way, \"He comes from a line of struggling farmers and saw [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] as a way out. While in law school at the University of Florida, he juggled going to class with helping to run the family's cattle operation. He won respect from unions as a labor lawyer, got elected state attorney and went on to leadership posts in the Florida Senate.\" {{ref|Beth}}\n\n==2006 election==\nIn January 2005, Smith announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Smith ran against Tampa [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. A statewide poll by the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]], released on August 28, 2006, showed Smith eight points down against Davis. A poll from earlier in the year showed Davis ahead 25 to 9 percent.{{ref|Commercepoll}} Conversely, a July 27 Quinnipiac University poll showed Smith trailing Davis by 28%. However, this poll also revealed that 33% of Democrats were still undecided.\n\nLate in May 2006, U.S. Representatives [[Kendrick Meek]] and [[Allen Boyd]] broke with their fellow Florida Democratic House members to endorse Smith.{{ref|MeekBoyd}} Smith has also been endorsed by former Florida [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] and former state Sen. Tom Rossin, the 2002 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor; state Sen. Dave Aronberg of [[Greenacres, Florida|Greenacres]]; the Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer; and county Commissioner Addie Greene, among others.{{ref|Endorsements}}. The co-chair of his campaign was former governor [[Wayne Mixson]].\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Rod Smith with Reps Meek and Boyd.jpg|thumb|right|360px|U.S. Congressmen Allen Boyd and Kendrick Meek endorsing Rod Smith]] -->\nIn August 2006, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' endorsed Smith, stating that his opponent, \"Davis has a solid record as an ethical, thoughtful state legislator and congressman who understands the challenges facing Florida. Smith combines the same grasp of those challenges with a more dynamic leadership style and a clearer, fresher record of building mainstream coalitions that can successfully carry the day on tough issues. That is what it will take for a Democrat to win in November and successfully govern in Tallahassee.\" {{ref|St.Pete}}\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, saying, \"Rep. Davis would return to Tallahassee with good intentions. Sen. Smith would take office knowing how to get good things done.\" {{ref|Post}} In addition, the ''Lakeland Ledger'' endorsed Smith stating, \"We believe Smith can appeal to a broader segment of the electorate -- that he can muster greater support in the Republican-leaning northern part of the state while still generating strong support in the urban areas of Central and South Florida.\" {{ref|Ledger}}\n\nLater in the month, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' endorsed the Senator, noting that between Smith and Davis, \"Smith's record is the more impressive of the two, and his familiarity with the Legislature and state government gives him the edge over Davis. Smith could literally win the November election and hit the ground running.\" {{ref|Sentinel}}\n\n''[[The Gainesville Sun]]'' also endorsed Smith saying, \"Rod Smith is a superb orator, a skilled negotiator and ...a razor-sharp intellectual and a constitutional scholar who immerses himself in minutia of public policy making .... We think Rod Smith is the Democrat in this race who has the political capital to undo some of the damage that's been done to public education these past eight years, find the right balance between environmental protection and economic growth, protect Florida's fragile water resources and get a handle on the state's runaway health care costs without restricting access to quality care.\" {{ref|Gainesville}}\n\nOn August 27, the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, noting his record of bipartisanship and stating, \"In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of the late [[Lawton Chiles]] to recapture the governor's office.\" {{ref|Herald}}\n\nSmith was criticized by media outlets for his allegedly-passive attitude toward Florida's sugar lobby and their attacks on his primary opponent. In August 2006, the Miami Herald wrote: \"Sen. Smith has been the beneficiary of a million-dollar anti-Davis ad campaign by U.S. Sugar Inc. Senator Smith vows to remain independent. But it could prove difficult to keep a respectable distance from special interests if he becomes beholden to them for outsized political contributions.\" The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which had endorsed Smith, added further criticism. \"What we find most disturbing is the response by state Sen. Rod Smith. Smith, who railed against smear tactics by third-party groups during his state senate campaigns, has consistently failed to rebuke Florida's Working Families (a notable front for Big Sugar interests) for the ads and, when asked, only repeats some of the allegations against Davis. Smith should denounce them.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Rod Smith lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. Davis subsequently lost the election to then Republican [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==2010 Election==\n\nOn August 17, 2010, Rod Smith was announced as the running mate for [[Alex Sink]] on the Democratic ticket for the [[2010 Florida gubernatorial election|race to succeed Crist]], who chose to run for [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|election to the U.S. Senate]] rather than for re-election as governor.{{ref|Sink}} On November 2, the Sink/Smith ticket lost to the Republican Scott/Carroll ticket by a 1% margin.\n\n== 2016 Election ==\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court ordered the drawing of new state senate districts in December 2015, District 8, a newly formed district comprising Alachua County, Putnam County, and the northern half of Marion County opened up. On March 1, 2016, Smith announced<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/203200-rod-smith-makes-state-senate-run-official-with-courthouse-announcement-in-gainesville|title=Rod Smith makes state Senate run official with courthouse announcement in Gainesville - Florida Politics|date=2016-03-01|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}</ref> his campaign for the seat against the then third-term Republican state representative Keith Perry. On November 8th, Smith lost to Perry with 47.4% of the vote, a 5.2% margin.\n\n==Florida Democratic Party==\n\nIn November 2010 Smith was elected chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]] (FDP), succeeding [[Karen Thurman]] who resigned on November 12, 2010, following the midterm elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013144622/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|url-status=dead|title=Resigned as chair of FDP|archivedate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>  Smith's term expired in January 2013 when he was succeeded by [[Allison Tant]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/26/3202707/allison-tant-wins-race-for-florida.html] The Miami Herald &mdash; Allison Tant wins Race for Florida Democratic chair\", Retrieved 2013-06-30</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*Florida Police Chiefs Association's Legislative Achievement Award (2002)&ndash;for efforts to improve public safety and fight crime\n*Voices of Children Foundation's MVP Leadership Award (2004)&ndash;for efforts on behalf of abused, abandoned and neglected children.\n*[[Florida AFL-CIO]] \"Legislator of the Year\"&ndash;efforts on behalf of organized labor\n\nSmith was also named the \"most effective Democrat in the Florida Senate\" by the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' in 2003.\n\n== Beliefs ==\nSenator Smith is generally regarded as a political moderate and has traditionally taken stances more conservative than the average Democrat. For example, he has received an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA).<sup>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=WFL51166&type=category&category=Gun%2BIssues&go.x=18&go.y=2]</sup> Still, during the first televised debate of the 2006 Democratic primary, Smith stated that he had \"no problem with a carefully defined assault weapons ban. We want to make sure we don't have weapons in the hands of people who aren't supposed to have them and we have tough laws to prevent that.\" {{ref|guns}} Smith has stated that he supports, and is a principal architect of, legislation requiring [[minors and abortion|parental notification for minors seeking an abortion]] but would \"leave an exception for the health and life of the mother.\" <sup>[http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/6297.article]</sup> Smith describes himself as [[pro-choice]] and his official website promised to, \"veto any legislation that would allow the government more influence over a woman's personal and private decisions regarding her own body.\"<sup>[http://rodsmith2006.com/pages/on_the_issues/#womens]</sup>\n\nOver the course of the 2006 gubernatorial primary, both Smith and his Democratic primary opponent took many positions not generally associated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The latter (Davis) voted for the Iraq War and \"also voted to ban flag-burning.\"  <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/state/15308254.htm]</sup> Both men agreed on [[capital punishment]] and both agreed on having only, as Davis put it, \"some restrictions on assault weapons.\"<sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/sfl-felxdemrail24xaug24,0,6347003.story?coll=sfla-news-florida]</sup>\n\n==Personal life==\nSmith and his wife, DeeDee, live on their farm in Alachua County. As reported in ''Tampa Bay Online'' Smith, \"married Deidra 'DeeDee' Painter, a lawyer .... They have three kids, one together and one each from previous marriages.\" {{ref|TBO}} DeeDee Smith graduated from law school at age 39 and is an attorney and advocate for child abuse victims.{{ref|wives}}\n\nSmith has 1 daughter, Alison Glover, and 2 sons, Jesse Smith and Dylan Smith. He also has, as of January, 2018, four grandchildren. Two from Alison and her husband, Graham Glover, named Hannah Grace and Graham, Jr., and two from Jesse and his wife, Jan, named Norah Lucille and Charlotte Warren.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n#{{note|Privatepractice}} Dennis, Brady. \"Rod Smith.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 7 July 2006.<sup>[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/07/07/State/Rod_Smith_.shtml]</sup>\n#{{note|Sentinel}} Sun-Sentinel Editorial Board. \"Governor.\" ''Sun-Sentinel'' 20 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/editorial/sfl-editfloridagovraceaug20,0,5115803.story]</sup>\n#{{note|Beth}} Reinhard, Beth. \"Underdog candidates get a final chance to make their mark.\" ''Miami Herald''. 26 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/columnists/15365596.htm]</sup>\n#{{note|Commercepoll}} Davis, Jennifer Krell. \"Democratic Race In Dead Heat Says Florida Chamber Poll.\" \"Florida Chamber of Commerce\". 8 June 2006.<sup>[http://www.flchamber.com/flcchw/hw.dll?page&file=nr060608]</sup>\n#{{note|MeekBoyd}}Smith, Adam C. \"Jim Davis can't shake Rod Smith.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 22 May 2006.<sup>[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/22/State/Jim_Davis_can_t_shake.shtml]</sup>\n#{{note|Endorsements}} Crowley, Brian. \"Local support for Smith grows.\" ''Palm Beach Post''. 24 June 2006.\n#{{note|St.Pete}} Times Editorial Board. \"Smith for Democrats.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 12 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/12/Opinion/Smith_for_the_Democra.shtml]</sup>\n#{{note|Post}} \"Democrats: Smith.\" ''Palm Beach Post''. 13 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/opinion/content/opinion/epaper/2006/08/13/a2e_demgov_endorse_0813.html]</sup>\n#{{note|Ledger}} \"Democrats: Smith for Governor.\" ''Lakeland Ledger'' 13 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060813/NEWS/608130368/1036/EDIT]</sup>\n#{{note|Gainesville}} \"Rod Smith, Democrat,\" ''The Gainesville Sun'' 20 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060820/EDITORIALS/208200326&SearchID=73254469622512]</sup>\n#{{note|Herald}} \"In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of...\" ''Miami Herald'' 27 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/opinion/15362161.htm]</sup>\n#{{note|OneFlorida}} Bennett, George. \"Smith says he can woo votes for Democrats.\" ''Palm Beach Post''. 9 July 2006.\n#{{note|guns}} Kleindienst, Linda. \"Where Jim Davis and Rod Smith stand.\" ''Sun-Sentinel'' 24 August 2006. <sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/sfl-felxdemrail24xaug24,0,6347003.story?coll=sfla-news-florida]</sup>\n#{{note|TBO}} Fechter, Michael. \"Rural Route to the Top.\" TBO.com news. 8 August 2006.[http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/MGBLOFCQLQE.html]\n#{{note|wives}} Shah, Nirvi. \"Gubernatorial candidates' wives toe the party.\" Palm Beach Post. 26 June 2006.\n#{{note|Sink}} Farrington, Brendan. \"Sink taps Smith as running mate in Fla.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: [[masia]]) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the academy players.

The author enumerates over 400 works in the Persian language on medicine, excluding authors such as [[Avicenna]], who wrote in Arabic. Author-historians Meyerhof, Casey Wood, and Hirschberg also have recorded the names of at least 80 [[Optometry|oculist]]s who contributed treatises on subjects related to [[ophthalmology]] from the beginning of 800&nbsp;AD to the full flowering of Muslim medical literature in 1300&nbsp;AD.\n\nAside from the aforementioned, two other medical works attracted great attention in medieval Europe, namely [[Al-Muwaffak|Abu Mansur Muwaffaq]]'s ''Materia Medica'', written around 950&nbsp;AD, and the illustrated ''Anatomy'' of ''Mansur ibn Muhammad'', written in 1396&nbsp;AD.\n\nModern academic medicine began in Iran when [[Joseph Cochran]] established a medical college in [[Urmia]] in 1878.

Most publications were from pharmacology and pharmacy labs located at a few top universities, most notably Tehran University of Medical Sciences. [[Ahmad Reza Dehpour]] and [[Abbas Shafiee]] were among the most prolific scientists in that era. Research programs in immunology, parasitology, pathology, medical genetics, and public health were also established in late 20th century. In 21st century, we witnessed a huge surge in the number of publications in medical journals by Iranian scientists on nearly all areas in basic and clinical medicine. Interdisciplinary research were introduced during 2000s and dual degree programs including Medicine/Science, Medicine/Engineering and Medicine/Public health programs were founded.

This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened its grip. In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced what he called the '[[resistive economy|economy of resistance]]', an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of ''Vision 2025''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Iran.

For instance, in order to ensure that 50% of academic research was oriented towards socio-economic needs and problem-solving, the ''[[economy of Iran#National economic planning|Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan]]'' (2010\u20132015) tied promotion to the orientation of research projects. It also made provision for research and technology centres to be set up on campus and for universities to develop linkages with industry.  The ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' had two main thrusts relative to science policy. The first was the \"islamization of universities', a notion that is open to broad interpretation. According to Article 15 of the ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'', university programmes in the humanities were to teach the virtues of critical thinking, theorization and multidisciplinary studies. A number of research centres were also to be developed in the humanities. The plan's second thrust was to make Iran the second-biggest player in science and technology by 2015, behind Turkey.

Between 2007 and 2013, student rolls swelled from 2.8 million to 4.4 million in the country's public and private universities. Some 45% of students were enrolled in private universities in 2011. There were more women studying than men in 2007, a proportion that has since dropped back slightly to 48%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnrollment has progressed in most fields. The most popular in 2013 were social sciences (1.9 million students, of which 1.1 million women) and engineering (1.5 million, of which 373 415 women). Women also made up two-thirds of medical students. One in eight bachelor's students go on to enroll in a master's/PhD programme. This is comparable to the ratio in the Republic of Korea and Thailand (one in seven) and Japan (one in ten).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe number of PhD graduates has progressed at a similar pace as university enrollment overall. Natural sciences and engineering have proved increasingly popular among both sexes, even if engineering remains a male-dominated field. In 2012, women made up one-third of PhD graduates, being drawn primarily to health (40% of PhD students), natural sciences (39%), agriculture (33%) and humanities and arts (31%).

Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38\u201339% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16% of PhD students).

By 2013, there were about 14 000 foreign students attending Iranian universities, most of whom came from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. In a speech delivered at the University of Tehran in October 2014, [[President Rouhani]] recommended greater interaction with the outside world. He said that {{Quote|text=scientific evolution will be achieved by criticism [...] and the expression of different ideas. [...] Scientific progress is achieved, if we are related to the world. [...] We have to have a relationship with the world, not only in foreign policy but also with regard to the economy, science and technology.

It was intended for one-third of this amount to come from abroad but, so far, FDI has remained elusive. It has contributed less than 1% of GDP since 2006 and just 0.5% of GDP in 2014. Within the country's ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' (2010\u20132015), a [[National Development Fund]] has been established to finance efforts to diversify the economy. By 2013, the fund was receiving 26% of oil and gas revenue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMuch of the US$3.7 trillion earmarked in ''Vision 2025'' is to go towards supporting investment in research and development by knowledge-based firms and the commercialization of research results. A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund's president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 knowledge-based companies by late 2014.

The ''International Kharazmi Festival in Basic Science'' and The ''Annual Razi Medical Sciences Research Festival'' promote original research in science, technology, and medicine in Iran. There is also an ongoing [[R&D]] collaboration between [[List of Iranian companies|large state-owned companies]] and the [[List of Iranian Universities|universities in Iran]].\n\nIranians welcome scientists from all over the world to Iran for a visit and participation in seminars or collaborations. Many Nobel laureates and influential scientists such as [[Bruce Alberts]], [[Frank Sherwood Rowland|F. Sherwood Rowland]], [[Kurt W\u00fcthrich]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] visited Iran after the Iranian revolution. Some universities also hosted American and European scientists as guest lecturers during recent decades.\n\nAlthough sanctions have caused a shift in Iran's trading partners from West to East, scientific collaboration has remained largely oriented towards the West. Between 2008 and 2014, Iran's top partners for scientific collaboration were the US, Canada, the UK and Germany, in that order. Iranian scientists co-authored almost twice as many articles with their counterparts in the USA (6 377) as with their next-closest collaborators in Canada (3 433) and the UK (3 318).<ref name=\":0\" /> Iranian and U.S. scientists have collaborated on a number of projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jillson|first=Irene|date=2013-03-18|title=The United States and Iran|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/united-states-and-iran|journal=Science & Diplomacy|volume=2|issue=1|access-date=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720045015/http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/united-states-and-iran|archive-date=20 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMalaysia is Iran's fifth-closest collaborator in science and India ranks tenth, after Australia, France, Italy and Japan. One-quarter of Iranian articles had a foreign co-author in 2014, a stable proportion since 2002. Scientists have been encouraged to publish in international journals in recent years, a policy that is in line with ''Vision 2025''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe volume of scientific articles authored by Iranians in international journals has augmented considerably since 2005, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Iranian scientists now publish widely in international journals in engineering and chemistry, as well as in life sciences and physics. Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. Contributing to this trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.\n\nIran has submitted a formal request to participate in a project which is building an [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in France by 2018. This megaproject is developing nuclear fusion technology to lay the groundwork for tomorrow's nuclear fusion power plants. The project involves the European Union, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and USA.

The then technologically superior Iraq and its use of [[chemical weapons]] on Iranians, made Iran to embark on a very ambitious science developing program by mobilizing scientists in order to offset its [[international isolation]], and this is most evident in the country's nuclear sciences advancement, which has in the past two decades grown by 8,400% as compared to the 34% for the rest of the world. This report further predicts that though Iran's scientific advancement as a response to its international isolation may remain a cause of concern for the world, all the while it may lead to a higher [[quality of life]] for the Iranian population but simultaneously and paradoxically will also isolate Iran even more because of the world's concern over Iran's technological advancements. Other findings of the report point out that the fastest growing sectors in Iran are Physics, Public health sciences, Engineering, Chemistry and Mathematics. Overall the growth has mostly occurred after 1980 and specially has been becoming faster since 1991 with a significant acceleration in 2002 and an explosive surge since 2005.<ref name=\"Iran\"/><ref name=\"science-metrix.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/s-www021610.php |title=Wall, war, wealth: 30 years in science |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607062036/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/s-www021610.php |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country.html |title=Iran showing fastest scientific growth of any country \u2013 science-in-society \u2013 18 February 2010 |magazine=New Scientist |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021000625/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country.html |archive-date=21 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Scientometrics, Volume 62, Number 2 |doi=10.1007/s11192-005-0017-5 |volume=62 |issue=2 |journal=Scientometrics |pages=239\u2013248|date=January 2005 |last1=Rezaei |first1=Nima |last2=Mahmoudi |first2=Maryam |last3=Moin |first3=Mostafa }}</ref> It has been argued that scientific and technological advancement besides [[Nuclear program of Iran|the nuclear program]] is the main reason for United States worry about Iran, which may become a superpower in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405095703/http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Soroor Ahmed |url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/203/5361/cut-motion-saw-trivialisation-of-politics/2010-05-09/science/story-detail/iran-turkey-break-scientific-monopolyhas-islam-anything-to-do-with-it.html |title=Iran, Turkey Break Scientific Monopoly Has Islam Anything to Do With It? |publisher=Radianceweekly.com |date=2010-05-09 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001071728/http://www.radianceweekly.com/203/5361/cut-motion-saw-trivialisation-of-politics/2010-05-09/science/story-detail/iran-turkey-break-scientific-monopolyhas-islam-anything-to-do-with-it.html |archive-date=1 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |title=Israeli study exposes fallacy of Iran threat |publisher=Geopolitical Monitor |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314054457/http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}</ref> Some in Iranian scientific community see sanctions as a western conspiracy to stop Iran's rising rank in modern science and allege that some (western) countries want to monopolize modern technologies.<ref name=\"NW-20090522\">{{cite news |first1=Maziar |last1=Bahari |url=https://www.newsweek.com/quarks-and-koran-irans-islamic-embrace-science-80063 |title=Quarks and the Koran: Iran's Islamic Embrace of Science |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221143733/https://www.newsweek.com/quarks-and-koran-irans-islamic-embrace-science-80063 |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref>\n* As per [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] report on science and engineering titled \"[[National Science Board#Activities as Policy Advisers to Congress and the President|Science and Engineering Indicators: 2010]]\" prepared by [[National Science Foundation]], Iran has the world's highest growth rate in Science & Engineering article output with an annual growth rate of 25.7%.

Many of the approaches of physicians in medieval Persia are accepted today; however, still more of them could be of use to modern medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gorji A |author2=Khaleghi Ghadiri M |title=History of headache in medieval Persian medicine |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=510\u20135 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12849336 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00226-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century work of [[Shahnameh]], [[Ferdowsi]] describes a [[Caesarean section]] performed on [[Rudabeh]], during which a special wine agent was prepared by a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest and used to produce unconsciousness for the operation.<ref>[[Edward Granville Browne]].

His student, [[Abu Bakr Joveini]], wrote the first comprehensive medical book in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language.\n\nAfter the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest of Iran]], medicine continued to flourish with the rise of notables such as [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]] and [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi|Haly Abbas]], albeit [[Baghdad]] was the new cosmopolitan inheritor of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Jundishapur's medical academy.\n\nAn idea of the number of medical works composed in Persian alone may be gathered from [[Adolf Fonahn]]'s ''Zur Quellenkunde der Persischen Medizin'', published in [[Leipzig]] in 1910. The author enumerates over 400 works in the Persian language on medicine, excluding authors such as [[Avicenna]], who wrote in Arabic. Author-historians Meyerhof, Casey Wood, and Hirschberg also have recorded the names of at least 80 [[Optometry|oculist]]s who contributed treatises on subjects related to [[ophthalmology]] from the beginning of 800&nbsp;AD to the full flowering of Muslim medical literature in 1300&nbsp;AD.\n\nAside from the aforementioned, two other medical works attracted great attention in medieval Europe, namely [[Al-Muwaffak|Abu Mansur Muwaffaq]]'s ''Materia Medica'', written around 950&nbsp;AD, and the illustrated ''Anatomy'' of ''Mansur ibn Muhammad'', written in 1396&nbsp;AD.\n\nModern academic medicine began in Iran when [[Joseph Cochran]] established a medical college in [[Urmia]] in 1878.

Most publications were from pharmacology and pharmacy labs located at a few top universities, most notably Tehran University of Medical Sciences. [[Ahmad Reza Dehpour]] and [[Abbas Shafiee]] were among the most prolific scientists in that era. Research programs in immunology, parasitology, pathology, medical genetics, and public health were also established in late 20th century. In 21st century, we witnessed a huge surge in the number of publications in medical journals by Iranian scientists on nearly all areas in basic and clinical medicine. Interdisciplinary research were introduced during 2000s and dual degree programs including Medicine/Science, Medicine/Engineering and Medicine/Public health programs were founded. [[Alireza Mashaghi]] was one of the main figures behind the development of interdisciplinary research and education in Iran.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Further|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}\n[[File:Astrolabe-Persian-18C.jpg|250px|right|thumb|An 18th century Persian astrolabe]]\nIn 1000&nbsp;AD, [[Biruni]] wrote an astronomical encyclopaedia that discussed the possibility that the earth might rotate around the sun. This was before [[Tycho Brahe]] drew the first maps of the sky, using stylized animals to depict the constellations.\n\nIn the tenth century, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi cast his eyes upwards to the awning of stars overhead and was the first to record a galaxy outside our own.

They are in charge of establishing national research policies.\n\nThe government first set its sights on moving from a resource-based economy to one based on knowledge in its 20-year development plan, ''Vision 2025'', adopted in 2005. This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened its grip. In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced what he called the '[[resistive economy|economy of resistance]]', an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of ''Vision 2025''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Iran.

This led to the adoption of incentive measures to raise the number of university students and academics, on the one hand, and to stimulate problem-solving and industrial research, on the other.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIran's successive five-year plans aim to realize collectively the goals of ''Vision 2025''. For instance, in order to ensure that 50% of academic research was oriented towards socio-economic needs and problem-solving, the ''[[economy of Iran#National economic planning|Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan]]'' (2010\u20132015) tied promotion to the orientation of research projects. It also made provision for research and technology centres to be set up on campus and for universities to develop linkages with industry.  The ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' had two main thrusts relative to science policy. The first was the \"islamization of universities', a notion that is open to broad interpretation. According to Article 15 of the ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'', university programmes in the humanities were to teach the virtues of critical thinking, theorization and multidisciplinary studies. A number of research centres were also to be developed in the humanities. The plan's second thrust was to make Iran the second-biggest player in science and technology by 2015, behind Turkey. To this end, the government pledged to raise domestic research spending to 3% of GDP by 2015.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yet, [[Science in Iran#Budget|R&D's share in the GNP]] is at 0.06% in 2015 (where it should be at least 2.5% of GDP)<ref>{{Cite paper|title=Memorandum of the foreign trade regime of Iran|publisher=[[Ministry of Commerce (Iran)|Ministry of Commerce]]|date=November 2009|url=http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713054415/http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf|archivedate=13 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=248319|work=Tehran Times|accessdate=18 May 2016|title=Govt.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015)]]\nThe result of greater spending on higher education has been a steep rise in tertiary enrollment. Between 2007 and 2013, student rolls swelled from 2.8 million to 4.4 million in the country's public and private universities. Some 45% of students were enrolled in private universities in 2011. There were more women studying than men in 2007, a proportion that has since dropped back slightly to 48%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnrollment has progressed in most fields. The most popular in 2013 were social sciences (1.9 million students, of which 1.1 million women) and engineering (1.5 million, of which 373 415 women). Women also made up two-thirds of medical students. One in eight bachelor's students go on to enroll in a master's/PhD programme. This is comparable to the ratio in the Republic of Korea and Thailand (one in seven) and Japan (one in ten).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe number of PhD graduates has progressed at a similar pace as university enrollment overall. Natural sciences and engineering have proved increasingly popular among both sexes, even if engineering remains a male-dominated field. In 2012, women made up one-third of PhD graduates, being drawn primarily to health (40% of PhD students), natural sciences (39%), agriculture (33%) and humanities and arts (31%). According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 38% of master's and PhD students were studying science and engineering fields in 2011.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:PhD graduates in Iran by field of study and gender, 2007 and 2012.svg|thumb|PhD graduates in Iran by field of study and gender, 2007 and 2012.

Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38\u201339% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16% of PhD students). Although data are not readily available on the number of PhD graduates choosing to stay on as faculty, the relatively modest level of domestic research spending would suggest that academic research suffers from inadequate funding.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' (2010\u20132015) fixed the target of attracting 25 000 foreign students to Iran by 2015. By 2013, there were about 14 000 foreign students attending Iranian universities, most of whom came from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. In a speech delivered at the University of Tehran in October 2014, [[President Rouhani]] recommended greater interaction with the outside world. He said that {{Quote|text=scientific evolution will be achieved by criticism [...] and the expression of different ideas. [...] Scientific progress is achieved, if we are related to the world. [...] We have to have a relationship with the world, not only in foreign policy but also with regard to the economy, science and technology.

The top destinations were Malaysia, the US, Canada, Australia, UK, France, Sweden and Italy. In 2012, one in seven international students in Malaysia was of Iranian origin.

One in four (26%) [[Women in Iran|Iranian researchers is a woman]], which is close to the world average (28%). In 2008, half of researchers were employed in academia (51.5%), one-third in the government sector (33.6%) and just under one in seven in the business sector (15.0%). Within the business sector, 22% of researchers were women in 2013, the same proportion as in Ireland, Israel, Italy and Norway. The number of firms declaring research activities more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from 30 935 to 64 642.

It was intended for one-third of this amount to come from abroad but, so far, FDI has remained elusive. It has contributed less than 1% of GDP since 2006 and just 0.5% of GDP in 2014. Within the country's ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' (2010\u20132015), a [[National Development Fund]] has been established to finance efforts to diversify the economy. By 2013, the fund was receiving 26% of oil and gas revenue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMuch of the US$3.7 trillion earmarked in ''Vision 2025'' is to go towards supporting investment in research and development by knowledge-based firms and the commercialization of research results. A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund's president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 knowledge-based companies by late 2014. Public and private universities wishing to set up private firms may also apply to the fund.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome 37 industries trade shares on the [[Tehran Stock Exchange]]. These industries include the petrochemical, automotive, mining, steel, iron, copper, agriculture and telecommunications industries, 'a unique situation in the Middle East'. Most of the companies developing high technologies remain state-owned, including in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, despite plans to privatize 80% of state-owned companies by 2014.

The ''International Kharazmi Festival in Basic Science'' and The ''Annual Razi Medical Sciences Research Festival'' promote original research in science, technology, and medicine in Iran. There is also an ongoing [[R&D]] collaboration between [[List of Iranian companies|large state-owned companies]] and the [[List of Iranian Universities|universities in Iran]].\n\nIranians welcome scientists from all over the world to Iran for a visit and participation in seminars or collaborations. Many Nobel laureates and influential scientists such as [[Bruce Alberts]], [[Frank Sherwood Rowland|F. Sherwood Rowland]], [[Kurt W\u00fcthrich]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] visited Iran after the Iranian revolution. Some universities also hosted American and European scientists as guest lecturers during recent decades.\n\nAlthough sanctions have caused a shift in Iran's trading partners from West to East, scientific collaboration has remained largely oriented towards the West. Between 2008 and 2014, Iran's top partners for scientific collaboration were the US, Canada, the UK and Germany, in that order. Iranian scientists co-authored almost twice as many articles with their counterparts in the USA (6 377) as with their next-closest collaborators in Canada (3 433) and the UK (3 318).<ref name=\":0\" /> Iranian and U.S. scientists have collaborated on a number of projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jillson|first=Irene|date=2013-03-18|title=The United States and Iran|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/united-states-and-iran|journal=Science & Diplomacy|volume=2|issue=1|access-date=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720045015/http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/united-states-and-iran|archive-date=20 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMalaysia is Iran's fifth-closest collaborator in science and India ranks tenth, after Australia, France, Italy and Japan. One-quarter of Iranian articles had a foreign co-author in 2014, a stable proportion since 2002. Scientists have been encouraged to publish in international journals in recent years, a policy that is in line with ''Vision 2025''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe volume of scientific articles authored by Iranians in international journals has augmented considerably since 2005, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Iranian scientists now publish widely in international journals in engineering and chemistry, as well as in life sciences and physics. Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. Contributing to this trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.\n\nIran has submitted a formal request to participate in a project which is building an [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in France by 2018. This megaproject is developing nuclear fusion technology to lay the groundwork for tomorrow's nuclear fusion power plants. The project involves the European Union, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and USA.

The then technologically superior Iraq and its use of [[chemical weapons]] on Iranians, made Iran to embark on a very ambitious science developing program by mobilizing scientists in order to offset its [[international isolation]], and this is most evident in the country's nuclear sciences advancement, which has in the past two decades grown by 8,400% as compared to the 34% for the rest of the world. This report further predicts that though Iran's scientific advancement as a response to its international isolation may remain a cause of concern for the world, all the while it may lead to a higher [[quality of life]] for the Iranian population but simultaneously and paradoxically will also isolate Iran even more because of the world's concern over Iran's technological advancements. Other findings of the report point out that the fastest growing sectors in Iran are Physics, Public health sciences, Engineering, Chemistry and Mathematics. Overall the growth has mostly occurred after 1980 and specially has been becoming faster since 1991 with a significant acceleration in 2002 and an explosive surge since 2005.<ref name=\"Iran\"/><ref name=\"science-metrix.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/s-www021610.php |title=Wall, war, wealth: 30 years in science |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607062036/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/s-www021610.php |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country.html |title=Iran showing fastest scientific growth of any country \u2013 science-in-society \u2013 18 February 2010 |magazine=New Scientist |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021000625/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country.html |archive-date=21 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Scientometrics, Volume 62, Number 2 |doi=10.1007/s11192-005-0017-5 |volume=62 |issue=2 |journal=Scientometrics |pages=239\u2013248|date=January 2005 |last1=Rezaei |first1=Nima |last2=Mahmoudi |first2=Maryam |last3=Moin |first3=Mostafa }}</ref> It has been argued that scientific and technological advancement besides [[Nuclear program of Iran|the nuclear program]] is the main reason for United States worry about Iran, which may become a superpower in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405095703/http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Soroor Ahmed |url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/203/5361/cut-motion-saw-trivialisation-of-politics/2010-05-09/science/story-detail/iran-turkey-break-scientific-monopolyhas-islam-anything-to-do-with-it.html |title=Iran, Turkey Break Scientific Monopoly Has Islam Anything to Do With It? |publisher=Radianceweekly.com |date=2010-05-09 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001071728/http://www.radianceweekly.com/203/5361/cut-motion-saw-trivialisation-of-politics/2010-05-09/science/story-detail/iran-turkey-break-scientific-monopolyhas-islam-anything-to-do-with-it.html |archive-date=1 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |title=Israeli study exposes fallacy of Iran threat |publisher=Geopolitical Monitor |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314054457/http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}</ref> Some in Iranian scientific community see sanctions as a western conspiracy to stop Iran's rising rank in modern science and allege that some (western) countries want to monopolize modern technologies.<ref name=\"NW-20090522\">{{cite news |first1=Maziar |last1=Bahari |url=https://www.newsweek.com/quarks-and-koran-irans-islamic-embrace-science-80063 |title=Quarks and the Koran: Iran's Islamic Embrace of Science |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221143733/https://www.newsweek.com/quarks-and-koran-irans-islamic-embrace-science-80063 |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref>\n* As per [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] report on science and engineering titled \"[[National Science Board#Activities as Policy Advisers to Congress and the President|Science and Engineering Indicators: 2010]]\" prepared by [[National Science Foundation]], Iran has the world's highest growth rate in Science & Engineering article output with an annual growth rate of 25.7%.
