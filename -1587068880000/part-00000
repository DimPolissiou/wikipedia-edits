His narrators explore how events live on in memory and means of communicating the events of the [[concentration camp]] to readers who cannot fathom that experience. His more recent work in this vein also includes reflections on the meaning of [[Europe]] and of being European, as informed by this period of history, including how Buchenwald was reopened by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces as Special Camp No. 2 of the [[NKVD]], and then largely razed and planted over by [[East Germany]] to hide the mass graves from this second dark episode.<ref>{{cite web | last = Haddad | first = Emmanuel | title = Jorge Sempr\u00fan: Buchenwald, 65 ans apr\u00e8s | url = http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/33107/jorge-semprun-buchenwald-commemoration-65-ans.html | publisher = [[caf\u00e9babel]] | date = 8 April 2010 | access-date = 7 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720205848/http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/33107/jorge-semprun-buchenwald-commemoration-65-ans.html | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSempr\u00fan's writing in Spanish deals with Spanish subject matter, and includes two volumes of memoirs: ''Autobiograf\u00eda de Federico S\u00e1nchez'', about his clandestine work in and later exclusion from the Spanish Communist Party (1953\u201364), and ''Federico S\u00e1nchez se despide de ustedes'', which deals with his term of service as Minister of Culture in the second Socialist government of [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] (1988\u201391). A novel in Spanish, ''Veinte a\u00f1os y un d\u00eda'', is set in 1956 and deals with recent history in Spain.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nSempr\u00fan's first book, ''Le grand voyage'' (''The Long Voyage'' in English; republished as ''The Cattle Truck'' in 2005 by [[Serif (publisher)|Serif]]), was published in 1963 by [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]]. It recounts Sempr\u00fan's [[deportation]] and incarceration in Buchenwald in fictionalized form. A feature of the novel, and with Sempr\u00fan's work in general, is its fractured chronology. The work recounts his train journey and arrival at the concentration camp.  During the long trip, the narrator provides the reader with flashbacks to his experiences in the French Resistance and flash-forwards to life in the camp and after liberation. The novel won two literary prizes, the ''[[Prix Formentor]]'' and ''[[Prix litt\u00e9raire de la R\u00e9sistance]]'' (\"Literary Prize of the Resistance\").\n\nIn 1977, his ''Autobiograf\u00eda de Federico S\u00e1nchez'' (''Autobiography of Federico S\u00e1nchez'') won the [[Premio Planeta]], the most highly remunerated literary prize in Spain. In spite of the pseudonymous title, the work is Sempr\u00fan's least fictionalized volume of autobiography,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Alli\u00e8s | first = Paul | title = Jorge Semprun: une 'autobiographie politique' | journal = P\u00f4le Sud | volume = 1 | issue =  1 | date = 1994 | pages = 11\u201321 | url =  http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/pole_1262-1676_1994_num_1_1_1323 }}</ref> recounting his life as a member of the central committee of the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), and his undercover activities in Spain between 1953 and 1964. The book shows a stark view of Communist organizations during the [[Cold War]], and presents a very critical portrait of leading figures of the PCE, including [[Santiago Carrillo]] and [[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]].\n\n''What a Beautiful Sunday'' (''Quel beau dimanche!''), his novel of life in Buchenwald and after liberation was published by [[\u00c9ditions Grasset|Grasset]] in 1980. It purports to tell what it was like to live one day, hour by hour, in the concentration camp, but like Sempr\u00fan's other novels, the narrator recounts events that precede and follow that day. In part, Sempr\u00fan was inspired by ''[[A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], and the work contains a criticism of [[Stalinism]] as well as [[fascism]].\n\n''Literature or Life'' was published by Gallimard in 1994.  The French title, ''L'Ecriture ou la vie'', might be better translated as \"Writing or Life\". Sempr\u00fan explores themes related to deportation, but the focus is on living with the memory of the experience and how to write about it. Sempr\u00fan revisits scenes from previous works and gives rationales for his literary choices.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Spanish Academy Award winners and nominees]]\n* [[Calle Mayor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* C\u00e9spedes Gallego, Jaime, ''La obra de Jorge Sempr\u00fan.

His more recent work in this vein also includes reflections on the meaning of [[Europe]] and of being European, as informed by this period of history, including how Buchenwald was reopened by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces as Special Camp No. 2 of the [[NKVD]], and then largely razed and planted over by [[East Germany]] to hide the mass graves from this second dark episode.<ref>{{cite web | last = Haddad | first = Emmanuel | title = Jorge Sempr\u00fan: Buchenwald, 65 ans apr\u00e8s | url = http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/33107/jorge-semprun-buchenwald-commemoration-65-ans.html | publisher = [[caf\u00e9babel]] | date = 8 April 2010 | access-date = 7 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720205848/http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/33107/jorge-semprun-buchenwald-commemoration-65-ans.html | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSempr\u00fan's writing in Spanish deals with Spanish subject matter, and includes two volumes of memoirs: ''Autobiograf\u00eda de Federico S\u00e1nchez'', about his clandestine work in and later exclusion from the Spanish Communist Party (1953\u201364), and ''Federico S\u00e1nchez se despide de ustedes'', which deals with his term of service as Minister of Culture in the second Socialist government of [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] (1988\u201391). A novel in Spanish, ''Veinte a\u00f1os y un d\u00eda'', is set in 1956 and deals with recent history in Spain.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nSempr\u00fan's first book, ''Le grand voyage'' (''The Long Voyage'' in English; republished as ''The Cattle Truck'' in 2005 by [[Serif (publisher)|Serif]]), was published in 1963 by [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]]. It recounts Sempr\u00fan's [[deportation]] and incarceration in Buchenwald in fictionalized form. A feature of the novel, and with Sempr\u00fan's work in general, is its fractured chronology. The work recounts his train journey and arrival at the concentration camp.  During the long trip, the narrator provides the reader with flashbacks to his experiences in the French Resistance and flash-forwards to life in the camp and after liberation. The novel won two literary prizes, the ''[[Prix Formentor]]'' and ''[[Prix litt\u00e9raire de la R\u00e9sistance]]'' (\"Literary Prize of the Resistance\").\n\nIn 1977, his ''Autobiograf\u00eda de Federico S\u00e1nchez'' (''Autobiography of Federico S\u00e1nchez'') won the [[Premio Planeta]], the most highly remunerated literary prize in Spain. In spite of the pseudonymous title, the work is Sempr\u00fan's least fictionalized volume of autobiography,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Alli\u00e8s | first = Paul | title = Jorge Semprun: une 'autobiographie politique' | journal = P\u00f4le Sud | volume = 1 | issue =  1 | date = 1994 | pages = 11\u201321 | url =  http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/pole_1262-1676_1994_num_1_1_1323 }}</ref> recounting his life as a member of the central committee of the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), and his undercover activities in Spain between 1953 and 1964. The book shows a stark view of Communist organizations during the [[Cold War]], and presents a very critical portrait of leading figures of the PCE, including [[Santiago Carrillo]] and [[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]].\n\n''What a Beautiful Sunday'' (''Quel beau dimanche!''), his novel of life in Buchenwald and after liberation was published by [[\u00c9ditions Grasset|Grasset]] in 1980. It purports to tell what it was like to live one day, hour by hour, in the concentration camp, but like Sempr\u00fan's other novels, the narrator recounts events that precede and follow that day. In part, Sempr\u00fan was inspired by ''[[A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], and the work contains a criticism of [[Stalinism]] as well as [[fascism]].\n\n''Literature or Life'' was published by Gallimard in 1994.  The French title, ''L'Ecriture ou la vie'', might be better translated as \"Writing or Life\". Sempr\u00fan explores themes related to deportation, but the focus is on living with the memory of the experience and how to write about it. Sempr\u00fan revisits scenes from previous works and gives rationales for his literary choices.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Spanish Academy Award winners and nominees]]\n* [[Calle Mayor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* C\u00e9spedes Gallego, Jaime, ''La obra de Jorge Sempr\u00fan.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name=\"skyscraper\" /><ref name=\"emporis\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web| author=[[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn]]| title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower| url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (later renamed SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe CN Tower was built by Canada Cement Company<ref name=\"Canada Cement Company\">title=Canada Cement Building| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canada_Cement_Building,_Montreal_04.jpg | access date=August 22, 2019</ref> (also known as the Cement Foundation Company of Canada at the time),<ref>Barr, Elinar, Jan. 1, 2015, p. 173 | title=Swedes in Canada: Invisible Immigrants |\npublisher=[[University of Toronto Press]], Canada, {{ISBN|978-1442613744}},  576 pages| accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> a subsidiary of Sweden's [[Skanska]], a global project-development and construction group.\n\n [[File:Ripleys Aquarium Toronto map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of the CN Tower and nearby buildings and structures]]\nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (and not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]] in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nThe tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CNTower\" /><ref name=\"ieee\" />\n\n[[File:CN Tower40 construction skycrane March 1975 01c.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment]]\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|abbr=on}}.\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Fulford| first=Robert| date=March 13, 1996| title=Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto| publisher=MacFarlane, Walter & Ross| page=32| isbn=978-0395773079}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Phases of construction ====\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"135px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:CN Tower footings 1973.jpg|Constructing the base, July 1973\nFile:Cntower1974.jpg|Brackets being raised, August 1974\nFile:CN Tower50 construction skycrane March 1975 01d.jpg|Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction (April 1975).jpg|Main pod construction, April 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction.jpg|Nearing completion, December 1975\nFile:CN Tower 1976.jpg|Two months after opening, August 1976\n</gallery>\n\n==== Architects ====\n*[[WZMH Architects]]\n*[[John Andrews (architect)|John Hamilton Andrews]]\n*Webb Zerafa\n*Menkes Housden with the help of E.R.

As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former [[Railway Lands]] were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] railway and subway station,  and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a [[Manhattanization|boom]] in [[condominium]] construction in the first quarter of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the [[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada|Ripley's Aquarium]] by the base of the tower.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:2015 Toronto Pan American Games-Laslovarga.jpeg|thumb|right|Fireworks display on the CN Tower during [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|the opening ceremony]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]\n*While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.<ref name=records/>\n*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/Press_Kit/CN_Tower_General_Information_2013_Revised.pdf |publisher=CN Tower |date=2013}}</ref>\n*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980.

The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |title=CN Tower |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406071501/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].\n\nThe main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas \u2014 at {{convert|338|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} \u2014 is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's [[UHF]] transmitters.

These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name=\"skyscraper\" /><ref name=\"emporis\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web| author=[[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn]]| title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower| url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (later renamed SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe CN Tower was built by Canada Cement Company<ref name=\"Canada Cement Company\">title=Canada Cement Building| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canada_Cement_Building,_Montreal_04.jpg | access date=August 22, 2019</ref> (also known as the Cement Foundation Company of Canada at the time),<ref>Barr, Elinar, Jan. 1, 2015, p. 173 | title=Swedes in Canada: Invisible Immigrants |\npublisher=[[University of Toronto Press]], Canada, {{ISBN|978-1442613744}},  576 pages| accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> a subsidiary of Sweden's [[Skanska]], a global project-development and construction group.\n\n [[File:Ripleys Aquarium Toronto map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of the CN Tower and nearby buildings and structures]]\nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (and not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]] in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nThe tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CNTower\" /><ref name=\"ieee\" />\n\n[[File:CN Tower40 construction skycrane March 1975 01c.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment]]\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|abbr=on}}.\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Fulford| first=Robert| date=March 13, 1996| title=Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto| publisher=MacFarlane, Walter & Ross| page=32| isbn=978-0395773079}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Phases of construction ====\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"135px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:CN Tower footings 1973.jpg|Constructing the base, July 1973\nFile:Cntower1974.jpg|Brackets being raised, August 1974\nFile:CN Tower50 construction skycrane March 1975 01d.jpg|Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction (April 1975).jpg|Main pod construction, April 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction.jpg|Nearing completion, December 1975\nFile:CN Tower 1976.jpg|Two months after opening, August 1976\n</gallery>\n\n==== Architects ====\n*[[WZMH Architects]]\n*[[John Andrews (architect)|John Hamilton Andrews]]\n*Webb Zerafa\n*Menkes Housden with the help of E.R.

[[Canadian National Railway]] sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when it decided to divest all operations not directly related to its core freight shipping businesses.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former [[Railway Lands]] were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] railway and subway station,  and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a [[Manhattanization|boom]] in [[condominium]] construction in the first quarter of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the [[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada|Ripley's Aquarium]] by the base of the tower.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:2015 Toronto Pan American Games-Laslovarga.jpeg|thumb|right|Fireworks display on the CN Tower during [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|the opening ceremony]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]\n*While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.<ref name=records/>\n*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/Press_Kit/CN_Tower_General_Information_2013_Revised.pdf |publisher=CN Tower |date=2013}}</ref>\n*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980.

The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |title=CN Tower |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406071501/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].\n\nThe main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas \u2014 at {{convert|338|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} \u2014 is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's [[UHF]] transmitters. The [[glass floor]] and outdoor observation deck are at {{convert|342|m|ft|1}}. The glass floor has an area of {{convert|24|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and can withstand a pressure of {{convert|4100|kPa|psi|0|lk=on}}.

He borrowed money to take them to the US and to [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] them. McCaskill had many contacts from his days with Clapton and managed to get [[Atlantic Records]] to sign them. The band relocated to Los Angeles and released the follow-up, ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'', better known as ''The White Album''. It reached [[record chart|No. 1]] and was the first of many with renowned producer [[Arif Mardin]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nMcIntosh died of a heroin overdose at a Los Angeles party on 23 September 1974.<ref name=\"Rockopedia\">{{cite book\n| first = David\n| last = Roberts\n| year = 1998\n| title = Guinness Rockopedia\n| edition = 1st\n| publisher = Guinness Publishing Ltd.\n| location = London\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/24 24]\n| isbn = 0-85112-072-5\n| url = https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/24\n}}</ref><ref name=\"AMG\"/> Gorrie also overdosed, but [[Cher]] kept him conscious until medical help arrived.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912985-6,00.html |title=Gorrie Overdose |publisher=Time.com |date=17 March 1975 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230215451/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C912985-6%2C00.html |archivedate=30 December 2010 }}</ref> The ''[[NME]]'' reported in January 1975 that AWB played a benefit show for McIntosh's widow at the [[Marquee Club]] in London.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first = John\n| last = Tobler\n| year = 1992\n| title = NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition = 1st\n| publisher = Reed International Books Ltd\n| location = London\n| page = 272\n| id = CN 5585}}</ref> McIntosh was replaced by [[Steve Ferrone]], previously of [[Bloodstone (band)|Bloodstone]]), who had replaced McIntosh before in  [[Brian Auger]]'s Oblivion Express.<ref name=\"Rockopedia\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the single \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\", taken from the No. 1 ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'' album, reached No. 1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The song knocked Linda Ronstadt's \"You're No Good\" out of No. 1 and sold over one million copies.

It was both a tribute to AWB's knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band's name.\n\nAWB followed up with the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]'' (1975) and ''[[Soul Searching (Average White Band album)|Soul Searching]]'' (1976), both big sellers and yielding further [[Top 40]] singles. ''Cut the Cake'' was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh's memory. A double live album \"Person To Person\" was issued in late 1976. Their next LP, ''Benny & Us'', was a collaboration with [[Ben E. King]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter several more albums, \"Warmer Communications\" (1978), \"Feel No Fret\" (1979) and after a switch to the U.S. Arista label, \"Shine\" (1980) and \"Cupid's In Fashion\" (1982), AWB's audience and sales dwindled. The group initially disbanded by 1983. Their 1980 [[disco]] hit \"[[Let's Go Round Again]]\" (UK No. 12),<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first = David\n| last = Roberts\n| year = 2006\n| title = British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition = 19th\n| publisher = Guinness World Records Limited\n| location = London\n| isbn = 1-904994-10-5\n| page = 34}}</ref> was [[cover version|covered]] in the late 1990s by [[Louise Nurding|Louise]].\n\nFerrone went on to work with [[Duran Duran]] and later with [[Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers]] from 1994 until Petty's death in 2017. Hamish Stuart joined [[Paul McCartney]]'s touring group.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, ''Sleepless Nights''.\n\nThe classic lineup of Gorrie, McIntyre, Ball, Stuart, Duncan and Ferrone reunited for one last time at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary in 1988. Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball then continued in 1989 to record ''[[Aftershock (Average White Band album)|Aftershock]]''. [[Alex Ligertwood]] (ex-[[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jeff Beck Group]] and another veteran of Brian Auger's Oblivion Express) also appeared on this album, replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band. Ligertwood left after the album's recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band's live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-[[Blood Sweat and Tears]]), who in turn was replaced by Fred \"Catfish\" Alias in September 1998. Drummer [[Adam Deitch]] did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.\n\nAverage White Band has continued recording (1997's ''Soul Tattoo'', 1999's ''Face to Face'') and touring since. Ball worked on ''Soul Tattoo'' with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.\n\nBrian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with [[Hall and Oates]]), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averagewhiteband.com |title=Averagewhiteband.com |publisher=Averagewhiteband.com |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152311/http://www.averagewhiteband.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTheir line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).\n\nDunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. After Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former [[Earth Wind and Fire]] member [[Morris Pleasure]] (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.\n\nBrent Carter (ex-[[Tower of Power]]) has been singing with AWB since 2011.\n\nIn July 2015, Malcolm \u2018Molly\u2019 Duncan, Steve Ferrone and Hamish Stuart reunited to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the original AWB. They released an album titled \"Three Sixty\" in 2017 and have been performing live together along with supporting musicians. \nAs of 2019, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre are the only two original members left in the Average White Band.\n\nOn 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Average White Band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the

They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\", and their albums ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'' and ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]''. The band name was initially proposed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. They have influenced others, such as the [[Brand New Heavies]], and been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by various musicians, including the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[The Beatnuts]], [[Too Short]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Nas]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Christina Milian]], and [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]]<ref name=\"Rockopedia\"/>, making them the 15th most sampled act in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/714/alan_gorrie_awb_everybody_be_cool_real |title=Average White Band interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' August 2011 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> As of 2018, 46 years after their formation, they continue to perform.\n\n==Career==\n===Formation===\nAWB was formed in early 1972<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first = Martin C.\n| last = Strong\n| year = 2000\n| title = The Great Rock Discography\n| edition = 5th\n| publisher = Mojo Books\n| location = Edinburgh\n| pages = 36\u201337\n| isbn = 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> in London by [[Alan Gorrie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst752.html |title=Alan Gorrie |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> and [[Molly Duncan|Malcolm \"Molly\" Duncan]], with Owen \"Onnie\" McIntyre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst2298.html |title=Owen (Onnie) McIntyre |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Michael Rosen (trumpet), [[Roger Ball (musician)|Roger Ball]], and [[Robbie McIntosh (drummer)|Robbie McIntosh]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst2301.html |title=Robert (Robbie) McIntosh 1950 \u2013 1974 |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> joining them in the original line-up.

Gorrie and McIntyre had been members of [[Forever More (band)|Forever More]]. McIntyre and McIntosh were used as [[session musician]]s on [[Chuck Berry]]'s recording of \"[[My Ding-a-Ling]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAccording to Duncan, members of the band had played together before in Scotland, but had moved to London separately and met up by chance at a [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] concert.  They decided to jam together; a friend heard them and remarked: \"This is too much for the average white man,\" which became adapted as the name of the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/14/average-white-band-how-we-made-pick-up-the-pieces-interview |title=Average White Band: how we made Pick Up the Pieces |first= Dave |last=Simpson |date=14 August 2017 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\nThe band's breakthrough was a support slot at [[Eric Clapton]]'s comeback concert in 1973.

He borrowed money to take them to the US and to [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] them. McCaskill had many contacts from his days with Clapton and managed to get [[Atlantic Records]] to sign them. The band relocated to Los Angeles and released the follow-up, ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'', better known as ''The White Album''.

The song knocked Linda Ronstadt's \"You're No Good\" out of No. 1 and sold over one million copies.

It was both a tribute to AWB's knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band's name.\n\nAWB followed up with the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]'' (1975) and ''[[Soul Searching (Average White Band album)|Soul Searching]]'' (1976), both big sellers and yielding further [[Top 40]] singles. ''Cut the Cake'' was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh's memory. A double live album \"Person To Person\" was issued in late 1976. Their next LP, ''Benny & Us'', was a collaboration with [[Ben E. King]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter several more albums, \"Warmer Communications\" (1978), \"Feel No Fret\" (1979) and after a switch to the U.S. Arista label, \"Shine\" (1980) and \"Cupid's In Fashion\" (1982), AWB's audience and sales dwindled. The group initially disbanded by 1983. Their 1980 [[disco]] hit \"[[Let's Go Round Again]]\" (UK No. 12),<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first = David\n| last = Roberts\n| year = 2006\n| title = British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition = 19th\n| publisher = Guinness World Records Limited\n| location = London\n| isbn = 1-904994-10-5\n| page = 34}}</ref> was [[cover version|covered]] in the late 1990s by [[Louise Nurding|Louise]].\n\nFerrone went on to work with [[Duran Duran]] and later with [[Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers]] from 1994 until Petty's death in 2017. Hamish Stuart joined [[Paul McCartney]]'s touring group.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, ''Sleepless Nights''.\n\nThe classic lineup of Gorrie, McIntyre, Ball, Stuart, Duncan and Ferrone reunited for one last time at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary in 1988. Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball then continued in 1989 to record ''[[Aftershock (Average White Band album)|Aftershock]]''. [[Alex Ligertwood]] (ex-[[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jeff Beck Group]] and another veteran of Brian Auger's Oblivion Express) also appeared on this album, replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band. Ligertwood left after the album's recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band's live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-[[Blood Sweat and Tears]]), who in turn was replaced by Fred \"Catfish\" Alias in September 1998. Drummer [[Adam Deitch]] did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.\n\nAverage White Band has continued recording (1997's ''Soul Tattoo'', 1999's ''Face to Face'') and touring since. Ball worked on ''Soul Tattoo'' with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.\n\nBrian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with [[Hall and Oates]]), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averagewhiteband.com |title=Averagewhiteband.com |publisher=Averagewhiteband.com |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152311/http://www.averagewhiteband.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTheir line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).\n\nDunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. After Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former [[Earth Wind and Fire]] member [[Morris Pleasure]] (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.\n\nBrent Carter (ex-[[Tower of Power]]) has been singing with AWB since 2011.\n\nIn July 2015, Malcolm \u2018Molly\u2019 Duncan, Steve Ferrone and Hamish Stuart reunited to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the original AWB. They released an album titled \"Three Sixty\" in 2017 and have been performing live together along with supporting musicians. \nAs of 2019, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre are the only two original members left in the Average White Band.\n\nOn 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Average White Band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the
