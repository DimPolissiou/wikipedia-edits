Although the survey of Neemuch\u2013Nasirabad railway was carried out in the year 1871-72, the construction was started in the year 1879, and the work completed in March 1881.\n\nGIPR's first BG tracks used 65&nbsp;lb/yd double-headed rails made of wrought iron.  Rails of 80&nbsp;lb/yd were common (e.g., Indian Midland Railway). Both flat-bottomed and bull-headed rails were commonly used. MG railways started off with 40&nbsp;lb/yd rails, although 30&nbsp;lb/yd rails were also used. The Barsi Light Railway used 30&nbsp;lb/yd rails. The Rajputana Malwa Railway used 50&nbsp;lb rails.\n\nThe first broad gauge line of the division from Godhra to Limkheda was completed in the year 1893 and Limkheda\u2013Dahod, Ratlam line was completed and opened for traffic in the year 1894, while the Ratlam\u2013Nagda\u2013Ujjain BG line completed and opened for traffic during the year 1896.\n\nThe whole management of this line was under (BB & CI) Bombay, Baroda & Central India Railway till independence i.e. up to 15.08.1947.\n\nThe first rail line in Rajputana, Agra\u2013Bharatpur was built in 1873 under Rajputana\u2013Malwa railway. It was extended up to Ajmer on 1 August 1875 and further extended up to Naseerabad on 14 February 1876. The total length of railways in Rajputana, including the British District of Ajmer\u2013Merwara, was 652 miles in 1881, 943 in 1891, 1,359 in 1901, and 1,576 miles in 1906 A.D., Out of which 739 miles track was the property of the Government of India and the rest was owned by various Native States. Out of 1,576 miles track, 1,528 miles track was on the metre-gauge system and only 48 miles track was on narrow-gauge system.\n\nSome states undertook extension of railways by financing the cost and entrusting the work of construction either to the British Government or to one of the companies already running a railway line. The Sanganer\u2013Sawai Madhopur railway was planned by Jaipur state in this way in 1884-85. The total cost of the line was about Rs. 25 lakhs. The railway line was so planned that it avoided the states of Tonk and Bundi and connected two important trade centres \u2013 Sambhar Salt area and the Harauti grain belt. It was hoped that it would make good returns on investment.\n\nThe remaining railway line in Rajasthan was the Udaipur\u2013Chitor, a portion of the Bina\u2013Guna\u2013Baran. It connected the towns after which it was named. It was 67 miles in length, and was the property of the Udaipur Durbar, by whom it was constructed between 1895 and 1899, and by whom it was working since 1898. The capital expenditure up to the end of 1904 was nearly 21 lakhs, and the net profits average about 5 per cent.\n\n==Electrification==\nThe electrification from Baroda to New Delhi was subsequently taken up during the year 1984.
