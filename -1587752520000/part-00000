Taking place in a world of anthropomorphic [[coffee bean]]s, the film tells the story of a bean assassin named Jack Bean, whose alias is Killer Bean, who goes on a mission to hunt a crime boss. The film was preceded by two [[Web series|web]] [[Short film|short]]s: \"Killer Bean: The Interrogation\" and \"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nThe film begins at a warehouse party with loud music that is attended solely by gangsters. At 2:30 AM, Killer Bean is at a nearby hotel trying to sleep, and makes a phone call asking them to turn down the music. The gangsters refuse, and  Killer Bean confronts them. After the gangsters fire a shot at Killer Bean and miss, Killer Bean ends up killing every one of the gangsters. The last bean killed is revealed to be the nephew of Cappuccino, a  mob boss.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4_7-lYjLEI/killerbeanforever.html |title=Youtube: Killer Bean Forever - Entire First Scene (Posted by Killer Bean Studios) |author=|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe police, led by Detective Cromwell, investigate the warehouse shootings. The warehouse is known to be owned by Cappuccino. As the police investigate, Vagan, a lieutenant of Cappuccino arrives at the warehouse. After discovering the massacre, Vagan, who runs guns for Cappuccino, quickly informs his boss what has happened and that Cappuccino is Killer Bean's next target. Due to Killer Bean's skill, Vagan suggests hiring mercenary soldiers to kill him.\n\nKiller Bean receives an encrypted call from his boss warning him that he is being reckless and that the attack on the warehouse should have never happened, and that only the \"target\" should be killed. Killer Bean assures his boss that the mission will succeed. Killer Bean goes to another of Cappuccino's warehouses but instead finds Vagan there, who attempts to kill him. The fight between Vagan and Killer Bean ends as a draw. Vagan leaves a note to Killer Bean which reads, \"Shadow Bean, you are too late\".\n\nKiller Bean later goes to a bar across the street where Detective Cromwell finds him. Cromwell suggests they work together to bring Cappuccino down, but Killer Bean refuses his help. Later, Cromwell finds the note referencing the \"Shadow Beans\". After a call to police intelligence, Cromwell discovers that the Shadow Beans were a private organization that carried out secret government operations, but disbanded years ago.\n\nKiller Bean locates a third warehouse, evidently attempting to find Cappuccino there. After killing the gangsters there, Killer Bean is confronted by mercenaries hired by Vagan. The mercenaries fail, but afterwards Vagan is able to capture Killer Bean. Cappuccino interrogates Killer Bean asking him why he wants to kill him, but receives no answers. Killer Bean escapes, and then reveals that he is not after Cappuccino, but rather after Vagan. Cappuccino, furious at Vagan's deception, tells Vagan that he's fired. Vagan shoots Cappuccino. Killer Bean explains that he has been sent to kill Vagan, a former Shadow Bean whose code name is Dark Bean. Dark Bean had betrayed the Shadow Agency and had stolen their secret database. Dark Bean then explains that the Shadow Agency had degenerated from an honorable agency into simply guns for hire, and that he was ordered to supply weapons to criminals. Dark Bean claims to have left the Shadow Agency and run guns for Cappuccino so that he could be knowledgeable of all weapon transfers, and thus could fight crime. Killer Bean doesn't believe him, and kills Dark Bean as he attempts to shoot Killer Bean first.\n\nDetective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean gives up, assuming that only the police can protect him from the Shadow Agency, and presumably because he would have to kill police officers. Meanwhile, the Shadow Agency has dispatched another Shadow Bean named Jet Bean to kill Killer Bean. Jet Bean, an assassin from the east, is one of the Shadow Agency's top Shadow Beans.\n\nKiller Bean is taken to prison, but Jet Bean manages to kill every police officer and find him in his cell. Killer Bean explains to Jet Bean that the Shadow Agency has gone criminal, but Jet Bean doesn't believe him. In the last fight scene, Killer Bean kills Jet Bean with much effort. Killer Bean then contacts the Shadow Agency on Jet Bean's cell phone, and they suggest Killer Bean come in to \"talk things over\". Killer Bean says he will come in, but it won't be for talk. The film ends with Killer Bean finding a cache of police weapons, and driving off to confront the Shadow Agency.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Vegas E.

Jeff Lew intended this short only to teach himself animation, and it only received about 3000 hits. After practicing animation for about 2 years, Lew started work on \"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\", a 7-minute short. \"Killer Bean 2\" took about 3 years to create, and was released on [[iFilm]] in 2000. In about 6 months, it received about a million views, which was significant before YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|title=Killer Bean Forever About the Director|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819102651/http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|url-status=|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> A later edit, \"Killer Bean 2.1\", was uploaded to YouTube in 2009.

The first rough draft of the screen play took about 5 months. [[Previsualization]] took about one and a half years. One mistake Lew regretted was not making the concept art before previz, which meant that many of the previz shots could not be reused for final animation. Lew then posted an ad on [[Craigslist]] for voices, and auditioned about 20 people and cast four. The concept artist for the characters was Von Caberte.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |title=Killer Bean Forever: The Art of Cabertevon |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813010508/http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |archive-date=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By July 2005, all preproduction was completed.\n\nThe film took about five years to create, with approximately one and half years in pre-production and three years in animation.

Prior to 1707, an [[Kingdom of England|English]] red ensign and a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] red ensign were flown by the English and Scottish Royal navies respectively. The precise date of the first appearance of these earlier red ensigns is not known, but surviving payment receipts indicate that the English navy was paying to have such flags sewn in the 1620s.\n\n==History==\n===England (pre-1707)===\n[[File:English Red Ensign 1620.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}English Red Ensign as it appeared in the 17th century.]]\n\nPrior to the reorganisation of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1864, the plain red ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|Red Squadron]] as early as 1558. By 1620 the plain red ensign started to appear with the Cross of St George in the upper-left canton. The Colony of [[Massachusetts]] used the red ensign, from its founding, and after a sermon by [[Roger Williams]] in 1636, equating crosses with the Papacy, Governor [[John Endecott|Endicott]] ordered the St. George cross removed from the flag. The Great and General Court of the colony found that Endicott had \"exceeded the lymits of his calling\", and yet left the flag without its cross for a number of decades afterward.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070401075528/http://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/NEFlag.html</ref>\n\nIn 1674, a Royal Proclamation of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630\u20131685, reigned 1660\u20131685) confirmed that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag to be worn by English [[merchant marine|merchant]] ships.  The wording of the 1674 proclamation indicates that the flag was customarily being used by English merchantmen before that date. At this time, the ensign displayed the English [[St George's Cross|Cross of St George]] in the [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]]. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the [[Red Ensign]] was allocated to merchantmen.\n\n===Scotland (pre-1707)===\n[[File:Scottish Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The Scottish Red Ensign, flown by ships of the former [[Royal Scots Navy]] before it was merged into the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1707.]]\nIt is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish records were lost at sea in the ship that was sent to return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with the \"[[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]]\", by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1239\u20131307, reigned 1272\u20131307). Prior to 1707 the Scottish Red Ensign was flown by ships of the [[Royal Scottish Navy|Royal Scots Navy]], with a [[Flag of Scotland|saltire]] in the canton.\n\nThe Scottish Ensign has been flown unofficially by many Scottish vessels for a number of years. In 2015, a movement was launched by Lieutenant Commander George MacKenzie [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] to have the Scottish Ensign officially recognised, on the basis that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 permits Her Majesty the Queen in Council or a Secretary of State to approve \"any colours consisting of the Red Ensign defaced or modified\". Supporters cited the example of the States of [[Jersey]], who in 2010 were permitted to use a \"voluntary or informal\" red ensign, adorned with a [[Plantagenet]] crown.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/could-scottish-ensign-replace-union-jack-on-ships-1-3777602|title=Could Scottish Ensign replace Union Jack on ships?|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 May 2015| access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/comment/14850611.Michael_Russell__Petition_aims_to_see_boats_flying_the_flag_for_Scotland/|title=Michael Russell: Petition aims to see boats flying the flag for Scotland|first=Michael|last=Russell|newspaper=The National|date=19 May 2015| \naccess-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The movement culminated in a petition for the [[Scottish Government]] to seek a warrant from the U.K. government to reintroduce the flag as an \"informal or voluntary ensign\" for Scottish merchant vessels.

An Order in Council of 21 July 1707, established as naval flags of the royal standard, the Union flag and \"the ensign directed by her Majesty since the said Union of the two Kingdoms\", which from the coloured drafts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of [[Great Britain]] and the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes.<ref>W. G. Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922)</ref>\n\nIn 1707, [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], ratifying the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year, were passed by the parliaments of [[Parliament of England|England]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|Scotland]], thereby uniting the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the [[Wales|Principality of Wales]]) into a new state with the name \"[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]\". This resulted in a new red ensign which placed the first [[Flag of Great Britain|Union Flag]] in the first quarter. The new design of the Red Ensign was proclaimed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1665\u20131714, reigned 1702\u20131714), who indicated that it was to be used by both the navy and ships owned by \"our loving subjects\". \n\nThe flag was flown by ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] before the [[American Revolution]]. Modification of the flag was used to express the discontent of the colonists before and during the outbreak of revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capture the Flag: The Stars and Stripes in American History|last=Testi|first=Arnaldo|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York, N.Y|pages=16}}</ref> This can be seen in both the [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton flag]] and the [[George Rex Flag|George Rex flag]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citizens or Papists?

The [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St Patrick's Cross]] was added to the Union Flag and, accordingly, to the first quarters of the British ensigns.\n\nThe [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]] included a specific provision that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag for a British merchantman. This provision was repeated in successive British shipping legislation (i.e., [[Merchant Shipping Act 1889|1889]], [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894|1894]] (section 73) and [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995|1995]]).\n\nUntil 1864, the Red Ensign was also the principal ensign of the Royal Navy, and as such it was worn by ships of the Red Squadron of the navy, as well as by those warships that were not assigned to any squadron (i.e., those sailing under independent command). The white ensign and the blue ensign were also used by the Royal Navy.\n\nMany in the [[Admiralty]] felt that the Royal Navy's use of three separate ensigns (i.e., the red, white, and blue) was outdated and confusing. Many also felt that steam merchantmen should be clearly distinguishable from warships. In July 1864, an [[order-in-council]] provided that the White Ensign was the ensign of the Royal Naval Service. The Blue Ensign was designated as the proper national colours for ships commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and (with an appropriate badge) as national colours for ships in government service. The Red Ensign was assigned to British merchantmen. This basic structure remains today.\n\nA few years later (1867\u20131869), the Admiralty determined that the [[Blue Ensign|blue ensign]] charged with an appropriate badge in the fly would be used as the ensign by those ships in the armed, or public, service of the many British colonies. Most British colonies needed to use the blue ensign due to the fact that most had government vessels; some colonies, such as South Australia, had warships. As a result, the Blue Ensign was used throughout the Empire and thus became the model for the flags used by a number of colonies and former colonies in the [[British Empire]]. At the same time, the red ensign (which was designated in 1864 as the flag for merchant shipping) was used by merchantmen of those colonies which obtained an Admiralty warrant. Not all colonies obtained an Admiralty warrant, however; the ones that did tended to be larger, and included Canada (1892); New Zealand (1899); Australia (1901); South Africa (1910) and [[Cyprus]] (1922). Those areas that did not have an Admiralty warrant used the plain Red Ensign, although unofficial local versions of the Red Ensign were used.\n\n{{As of|2005|alt=Today}}, Red Ensigns charged with the local emblem are available to be used by ships registered on several of the component registers of the Red Ensign Group:  [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], and [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==Plain red ensign==\nThe plain red ensign is the [[civil ensign]] or merchant ensign of the [[United Kingdom]]. The flag has overall ratio of 1:2 with the [[Union Jack|Union]] occupying one quarter of the field and placed in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]].\n\n==Defaced red ensign==\nSome government departments or public bodies fly red ensigns [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of United Kingdom.

The flag has apparently been flown unofficially since Bermuda's arms were granted in 1910. There appears to be no formal adoption of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship ''[[Sea Venture]]'' off of Bermuda in 1609. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda's land flag due to Canadian influence. (In the early 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag.) Bermuda's 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s. Bermuda (civil) Government vessels and maritime services use the [[Blue Ensign#Defaced blue ensign|defaced blue ensign]], which is flown both from vessels and from shore facilities.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Gibraltar====\n[[File:Civil_Ensign_of_Gibraltar.svg|250px|right|thumb|[[Gibraltar]]'s Red Ensign]]\n[[Gibraltar]] features variant flags of the territory which incorporate the Gibraltar [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|coat of arms]] into a red ensign.

From 1901 to 1954 the flag was used as a civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] stated that there should be no restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]] reaffirmed this position, but it was not until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not both at the same time.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00182/c53816f1-e166-4a20-b073-5b59c8003a02\n|title=Shipping Registration Act 1981\n|pages=10, 22\n|accessdate=2012-04-25\n}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Red Ensign}}\n{{See also|Great Canadian Flag Debate|Flag of Manitoba|Flag of Ontario}}\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1868-1921.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1868\u20131921)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1921\u20131957)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Final Canadian Red Ensign (1957\u20131965)]]\n\nThe term \"Red Ensign\" is often used to refer to the [[Canadian Red Ensign]], the former ''de facto'' [[national flag]] of Canada. It was informally adopted following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the Red Ensign was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.\n\nCanada's Red Ensign bore various forms of the shield from the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canadian coat of arms]] in its fly during the period of its use. Shown here are pictures of the three official forms between 1868 and 1965.

Prior to 1707, an [[Kingdom of England|English]] red ensign and a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] red ensign were flown by the English and Scottish Royal navies respectively. The precise date of the first appearance of these earlier red ensigns is not known, but surviving payment receipts indicate that the English navy was paying to have such flags sewn in the 1620s.\n\n==History==\n===England (pre-1707)===\n[[File:English Red Ensign 1620.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}English Red Ensign as it appeared in the 17th century.]]\n\nPrior to the reorganisation of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1864, the plain red ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|Red Squadron]] as early as 1558. By 1620 the plain red ensign started to appear with the Cross of St George in the upper-left canton. The Colony of [[Massachusetts]] used the red ensign, from its founding, and after a sermon by [[Roger Williams]] in 1636, equating crosses with the Papacy, Governor [[John Endecott|Endicott]] ordered the St. George cross removed from the flag. The Great and General Court of the colony found that Endicott had \"exceeded the lymits of his calling\", and yet left the flag without its cross for a number of decades afterward.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070401075528/http://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/NEFlag.html</ref>\n\nIn 1674, a Royal Proclamation of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630\u20131685, reigned 1660\u20131685) confirmed that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag to be worn by English [[merchant marine|merchant]] ships.  The wording of the 1674 proclamation indicates that the flag was customarily being used by English merchantmen before that date. At this time, the ensign displayed the English [[St George's Cross|Cross of St George]] in the [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]]. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the [[Red Ensign]] was allocated to merchantmen.\n\n===Scotland (pre-1707)===\n[[File:Scottish Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The Scottish Red Ensign, flown by ships of the former [[Royal Scots Navy]] before it was merged into the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1707.]]\nIt is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish records were lost at sea in the ship that was sent to return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with the \"[[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]]\", by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1239\u20131307, reigned 1272\u20131307). Prior to 1707 the Scottish Red Ensign was flown by ships of the [[Royal Scottish Navy|Royal Scots Navy]], with a [[Flag of Scotland|saltire]] in the canton.\n\nThe Scottish Ensign has been flown unofficially by many Scottish vessels for a number of years. In 2015, a movement was launched by Lieutenant Commander George MacKenzie [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] to have the Scottish Ensign officially recognised, on the basis that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 permits Her Majesty the Queen in Council or a Secretary of State to approve \"any colours consisting of the Red Ensign defaced or modified\". Supporters cited the example of the States of [[Jersey]], who in 2010 were permitted to use a \"voluntary or informal\" red ensign, adorned with a [[Plantagenet]] crown.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/could-scottish-ensign-replace-union-jack-on-ships-1-3777602|title=Could Scottish Ensign replace Union Jack on ships?|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 May 2015| access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/comment/14850611.Michael_Russell__Petition_aims_to_see_boats_flying_the_flag_for_Scotland/|title=Michael Russell: Petition aims to see boats flying the flag for Scotland|first=Michael|last=Russell|newspaper=The National|date=19 May 2015| \naccess-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The movement culminated in a petition for the [[Scottish Government]] to seek a warrant from the U.K. government to reintroduce the flag as an \"informal or voluntary ensign\" for Scottish merchant vessels.

An Order in Council of 21 July 1707, established as naval flags of the royal standard, the Union flag and \"the ensign directed by her Majesty since the said Union of the two Kingdoms\", which from the coloured drafts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of [[Great Britain]] and the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes.<ref>W. G. Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922)</ref>\n\nIn 1707, [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], ratifying the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year, were passed by the parliaments of [[Parliament of England|England]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|Scotland]], thereby uniting the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the [[Wales|Principality of Wales]]) into a new state with the name \"[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]\". This resulted in a new red ensign which placed the first [[Flag of Great Britain|Union Flag]] in the first quarter. The new design of the Red Ensign was proclaimed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1665\u20131714, reigned 1702\u20131714), who indicated that it was to be used by both the navy and ships owned by \"our loving subjects\". \n\nThe flag was flown by ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] before the [[American Revolution]]. Modification of the flag was used to express the discontent of the colonists before and during the outbreak of revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capture the Flag: The Stars and Stripes in American History|last=Testi|first=Arnaldo|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York, N.Y|pages=16}}</ref> This can be seen in both the [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton flag]] and the [[George Rex Flag|George Rex flag]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citizens or Papists?

The [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St Patrick's Cross]] was added to the Union Flag and, accordingly, to the first quarters of the British ensigns.\n\nThe [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]] included a specific provision that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag for a British merchantman. This provision was repeated in successive British shipping legislation (i.e., [[Merchant Shipping Act 1889|1889]], [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894|1894]] (section 73) and [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995|1995]]).\n\nUntil 1864, the Red Ensign was also the principal ensign of the Royal Navy, and as such it was worn by ships of the Red Squadron of the navy, as well as by those warships that were not assigned to any squadron (i.e., those sailing under independent command). The white ensign and the blue ensign were also used by the Royal Navy.\n\nMany in the [[Admiralty]] felt that the Royal Navy's use of three separate ensigns (i.e., the red, white, and blue) was outdated and confusing. Many also felt that steam merchantmen should be clearly distinguishable from warships. In July 1864, an [[order-in-council]] provided that the White Ensign was the ensign of the Royal Naval Service. The Blue Ensign was designated as the proper national colours for ships commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and (with an appropriate badge) as national colours for ships in government service. The Red Ensign was assigned to British merchantmen. This basic structure remains today.\n\nA few years later (1867\u20131869), the Admiralty determined that the [[Blue Ensign|blue ensign]] charged with an appropriate badge in the fly would be used as the ensign by those ships in the armed, or public, service of the many British colonies. Most British colonies needed to use the blue ensign due to the fact that most had government vessels; some colonies, such as South Australia, had warships. As a result, the Blue Ensign was used throughout the Empire and thus became the model for the flags used by a number of colonies and former colonies in the [[British Empire]]. At the same time, the red ensign (which was designated in 1864 as the flag for merchant shipping) was used by merchantmen of those colonies which obtained an Admiralty warrant. Not all colonies obtained an Admiralty warrant, however; the ones that did tended to be larger, and included Canada (1892); New Zealand (1899); Australia (1901); South Africa (1910) and [[Cyprus]] (1922). Those areas that did not have an Admiralty warrant used the plain Red Ensign, although unofficial local versions of the Red Ensign were used.\n\n{{As of|2005|alt=Today}}, Red Ensigns charged with the local emblem are available to be used by ships registered on several of the component registers of the Red Ensign Group:  [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], and [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==Plain red ensign==\nThe plain red ensign is the [[civil ensign]] or merchant ensign of the [[United Kingdom]]. The flag has overall ratio of 1:2 with the [[Union Jack|Union]] occupying one quarter of the field and placed in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]].\n\n==Defaced red ensign==\nSome government departments or public bodies fly red ensigns [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of United Kingdom.

There appears to be no formal adoption of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship ''[[Sea Venture]]'' off of Bermuda in 1609. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda's land flag due to Canadian influence. (In the early 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag.) Bermuda's 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s.

From 1901 to 1954 the flag was used as a civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] stated that there should be no restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]] reaffirmed this position, but it was not until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not both at the same time.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00182/c53816f1-e166-4a20-b073-5b59c8003a02\n|title=Shipping Registration Act 1981\n|pages=10, 22\n|accessdate=2012-04-25\n}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Red Ensign}}\n{{See also|Great Canadian Flag Debate|Flag of Manitoba|Flag of Ontario}}\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1868-1921.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1868\u20131921)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1921\u20131957)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Final Canadian Red Ensign (1957\u20131965)]]\n\nThe term \"Red Ensign\" is often used to refer to the [[Canadian Red Ensign]], the former ''de facto'' [[national flag]] of Canada. It was informally adopted following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the Red Ensign was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.\n\nCanada's Red Ensign bore various forms of the shield from the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canadian coat of arms]] in its fly during the period of its use. Shown here are pictures of the three official forms between 1868 and 1965. Canada also used a [[blue ensign]] for ships operated by the Canadian government and for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].\n\nThe Red Ensign served as Canada's national flag until 1965 when, after considerable [[Great Canadian Flag Debate|debate]], it was replaced by the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]]. The Red Ensign is still popular among [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalists]] and [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchists]]. Although the national Red Ensign is no longer used officially, the provincial flags of [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]] and [[Flag of Ontario|Ontario]] are Red Ensigns bearing their respective coats of arms.\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[North West Company]] also used Red Ensigns as their corporate flags.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Ontario.svg|Ontario's official flag since 1965\nFile:Flag of Manitoba.svg|Manitoba's official flag since 1966\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag.svg|Hudson's Bay Company corporate flag\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag (1707-1801).svg|HBC flag, 1707-1801\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag (1682-1707).svg|HBC flag, 1682-1707\nFile:Flag of the North West Company Post-1801.svg|[[North West Company]] flag, 1801-1821\nFile:Flag of the North West Company Pre-1801.svg|North West Company flag before 1801\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Newfoundland====\n[[File:Dominion of Newfoundland Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Newfoundland Red Ensign]]\nThe Red Ensign with the Newfoundland great seal in the fly was considered the unofficial flag of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] from 1904 until 1931, at which point it was officially legislated as the Dominion of Newfoundland's \"National Colours\" to be flown as the [[civil ensign]], with the [[Union Flag]] being legislated as the national flag at that time as well.

The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics. As a hunter of fowl and upland game, the Vizsla has held a prominent position among sporting dogs &ndash; that of household companion and family dog.\n\nThe Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and outstanding trainability. It was bred to work in fields, forests or bodies of water. Although they are lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess a well-developed protective instinct.<ref name=\"vca\">{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/vizsla/history.htm|title=Vizsla Club of America|accessdate = 16 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080417005637/http://clubs.akc.org/vizsla/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 17 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Appearance===\nThe Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing.<ref name=\"akc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/vizsla/|title=AKC Vizsla Breed Standard|accessdate = 16 June 2008}}</ref> Robust, but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs that have defined muscles.\n\nVarious breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas and vice versa are commonly mistaken for other breeds. [[Redbone Coonhound]]s, [[Weimaraner]]s and [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]]s are most commonly mixed up. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. However, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas.\n\nThe nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradovizsla.org/|title=Colorado Wyoming Vizsla Rescue Group|accessdate = 16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Color and coats====\nThe standard coat is a solid golden rust color in several shadings.<ref name=\"akc\"/> The coat could also be described as a copper-brown color, russet gold, and dark sandy gold. Solid, dark, mahogany red and pale yellow are considered faults and a disqualification in competitions. Small areas of white on the fore-chest, neck, or tail are permissible<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/vizsla/index.cfm|title=Vizsla Dog Breed Information|work=akc.org}}</ref> but not preferred. Some variations in the Vizsla coat color along their back (saddle-type marks) are typical.\n\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standards for the Vizsla states that the coat should be short, smooth, dense, and close-lying, without a woolly undercoat. The Vizsla is not suited to being kept outside since, unlike most other breeds, it does not have an undercoat. They are self-cleaning dogs and rarely need to be bathed, if ever. They have little noticeable \"dog smell\" detectable by humans. After several forays into lakes and streams they will develop an aroma that is a weaker version of the 'wet dog' smell. A quick bath and this odor will vanish.\n\n====Size====\n\nThe Vizsla is a medium-sized dog, The average height and weight:\n\n*Males\n**Height: {{convert|23|-|27|in|cm|abbr=on}}\n**Weight: {{convert|45|-|66|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n*Females\n**Height: {{convert|21|-|24|in|cm|abbr=on}}\n**Weight: {{convert|40|-|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Vizsla appearance\">\nFile:Anzu.JPG|Vizslas are gentle-mannered dogs \nFile:Wy\u017ce\u0142 w\u0119gierski g\u0142adkow\u0142osy 500.jpg|The Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog\nFile:Male Vizsla.jpg|Vizsla portrait\nFile:Vizsla-profile.jpg|Five-month-old Vizsla with the AKC standard \"golden rust\" coat\n</gallery>\n\n====Tail====\n[[File:Vizsla r\u00e1h\u00faz a vadra.jpg|thumb|Vizsla pointing]]\n[[File:Vizsla Rosie water harness.jpg|thumb|Vizsla in water]]\nThe American breed standard does call for the tail to be [[Docking (dog)|docked]] to two-thirds of its original length.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/hungarian-wire-haired-vizsla|work=United Kennel Club website|title=Breed Standards: Hungarian Wire-Haired Vizsla|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> Breed standards in countries where docking is banned, such as the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/media-centre/issue-statements/tail-docking|work=Kennel Club Media Centre|title=Tail docking|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> do not allow this. The Vizsla holds its tail horizontal to the ground and wags it vigorously while charging through rough scrub and undergrowth.\n\nThe docked tail of the Vizsla is significantly longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the [[Weimaraner]], [[Dobermann]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], and [[Australian Shepherd]]. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.\n\n===Temperament===\n[[File:Vizsla Dorl.JPG|thumb]]\nVizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal,<ref>{{cite news|author=Kara Spak|title=Labrador retriever is Chicago's top dog|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1393115,chicago-top-dog-labrador-012209.article|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=23 January 2009}}</ref> caring, and very affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children, and even strangers. Often, they are referred to as \"velcro\" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Vizslas will cry or whine when they feel neglected or are otherwise unhappy. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the \"pack\" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained to be so.\n\nThey are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training.<ref name=\"akc\"/> Not only are they great [[Pointing breed|pointers]], but they are excellent [[retriever]]s as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly.<ref name=\"gottlieb\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Gottlieb\n  | first = Gay\n  | title = The Complete Hungarian Vizsla\n  | publisher = Ringpress\n  | year = 2002\n  | isbn = 0-948955-32-5 }}\n</ref> However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session.\n\nVizslas are excellent swimmers. Some may need a little motivation to get in the water but as they get used to it they will love it. Like all [[hunting dog]]s, Vizslas require a great deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy.\n\nThe Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. They are intelligent dogs and need a lot of mental stimulation when young. If left alone for long hours, they can be bored and become destructive.<ref>{{cite web|title=The VIZSLA|url=http://www.hungarianvizslaclub.org.uk/owning/the-vizsla/|accessdate = 15 September 2015}}</ref> With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that can be great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much as possible.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:vizsla.jpg|thumbnail|Vizslas are excellent swimmers.]]\n[[File:Vizslacoldweather.jpg|thumb|Vizslas that live in cold weather climates often need protection from the harsh conditions.]]\nA Vizsla Club of America survey puts the average lifespan of the Vizsla at 9.15 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vizsla Club of America Welfare Foundation 2008 Health Survey|url=http://vcaweb.org/download/2008VizslaHealthSurvey_info.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>  The Vizsla is considered to be a robust dog but some localized breeding programs using a small number of dogs have led to heritable illnesses in some offspring including:\n* [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]] is very rare but remotely possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offa.org/hipstatbreed.html|title=Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|accessdate = 19 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614195118/http://www.offa.org/hipstatbreed.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 14 June 2008}}</ref>\n* Canine epilepsy\n* Cancer (mast cell tumors, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma)\n* [[Sebaceous adenitis]]\nResponsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offa.org/purpose.html|title=Orthopedic Foundation for Animals: Purpose|work=offa.org}}</ref>\nVizslas can also suffer from [[hypothyroidism]], [[dwarfism]], persistent right aortic arch, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy.

Records of letters and writings show the high esteem in which the Vizsla was held.\n\nThe Vizsla has survived the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] (1526\u20131696), the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and the [[Hungarian People's Republic]]. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near-extinctions in their history, including being overrun by [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]]s and [[German Shorthaired Pointer]]s in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near-extinction after World War II.<ref name=\"boggs\"/> A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various \"strains\" of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas are commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia.\n\nThe Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain AKC recognition.

The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics. As a hunter of fowl and upland game, the Vizsla has held a prominent position among sporting dogs &ndash; that of household companion and family dog.\n\nThe Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and outstanding trainability. It was bred to work in fields, forests or bodies of water. Although they are lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess a well-developed protective instinct.<ref name=\"vca\">{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/vizsla/history.htm|title=Vizsla Club of America|accessdate = 16 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080417005637/http://clubs.akc.org/vizsla/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 17 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Appearance===\nThe Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing.<ref name=\"akc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/vizsla/|title=AKC Vizsla Breed Standard|accessdate = 16 June 2008}}</ref> Robust, but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs that have defined muscles.\n\nVarious breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas and vice versa are commonly mistaken for other breeds. [[Redbone Coonhound]]s, [[Weimaraner]]s and [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]]s are most commonly mixed up. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. However, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas.\n\nThe nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradovizsla.org/|title=Colorado Wyoming Vizsla Rescue Group|accessdate = 16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Color and coats====\nThe standard coat is a solid golden rust color in several shadings.<ref name=\"akc\"/> The coat could also be described as a copper-brown color, russet gold, and dark sandy gold. Solid, dark, mahogany red and pale yellow are considered faults and a disqualification in competitions. Small areas of white on the fore-chest, neck, or tail are permissible<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/vizsla/index.cfm|title=Vizsla Dog Breed Information|work=akc.org}}</ref> but not preferred. Some variations in the Vizsla coat color along their back (saddle-type marks) are typical.\n\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standards for the Vizsla states that the coat should be short, smooth, dense, and close-lying, without a woolly undercoat. The Vizsla is not suited to being kept outside since, unlike most other breeds, it does not have an undercoat. They are self-cleaning dogs and rarely need to be bathed, if ever. They have little noticeable \"dog smell\" detectable by humans. After several forays into lakes and streams they will develop an aroma that is a weaker version of the 'wet dog' smell. A quick bath and this odor will vanish.\n\n====Size====\n\nThe Vizsla is a medium-sized dog, The average height and weight:\n\n*Males\n**Height: {{convert|23|-|27|in|cm|abbr=on}}\n**Weight: {{convert|45|-|66|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n*Females\n**Height: {{convert|21|-|24|in|cm|abbr=on}}\n**Weight: {{convert|40|-|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Vizsla appearance\">\nFile:Anzu.JPG|Vizslas are gentle-mannered dogs \nFile:Wy\u017ce\u0142 w\u0119gierski g\u0142adkow\u0142osy 500.jpg|The Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog\nFile:Male Vizsla.jpg|Vizsla portrait\nFile:Vizsla-profile.jpg|Five-month-old Vizsla with the AKC standard \"golden rust\" coat\n</gallery>\n\n====Tail====\n[[File:Vizsla r\u00e1h\u00faz a vadra.jpg|thumb|Vizsla pointing]]\n[[File:Vizsla Rosie water harness.jpg|thumb|Vizsla in water]]\nThe American breed standard does call for the tail to be [[Docking (dog)|docked]] to two-thirds of its original length.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/hungarian-wire-haired-vizsla|work=United Kennel Club website|title=Breed Standards: Hungarian Wire-Haired Vizsla|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> Breed standards in countries where docking is banned, such as the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/media-centre/issue-statements/tail-docking|work=Kennel Club Media Centre|title=Tail docking|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> do not allow this. The Vizsla holds its tail horizontal to the ground and wags it vigorously while charging through rough scrub and undergrowth.\n\nThe docked tail of the Vizsla is significantly longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the [[Weimaraner]], [[Dobermann]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], and [[Australian Shepherd]]. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.\n\n===Temperament===\n[[File:Vizsla Dorl.JPG|thumb]]\nVizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal,<ref>{{cite news|author=Kara Spak|title=Labrador retriever is Chicago's top dog|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1393115,chicago-top-dog-labrador-012209.article|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=23 January 2009}}</ref> caring, and very affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children, and even strangers. Often, they are referred to as \"velcro\" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Vizslas will cry or whine when they feel neglected or are otherwise unhappy. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the \"pack\" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained to be so.\n\nThey are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training.<ref name=\"akc\"/> Not only are they great [[Pointing breed|pointers]], but they are excellent [[retriever]]s as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly.<ref name=\"gottlieb\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Gottlieb\n  | first = Gay\n  | title = The Complete Hungarian Vizsla\n  | publisher = Ringpress\n  | year = 2002\n  | isbn = 0-948955-32-5 }}\n</ref> However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session.\n\nVizslas are excellent swimmers. Some may need a little motivation to get in the water but as they get used to it they will love it. Like all [[hunting dog]]s, Vizslas require a great deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy.\n\nThe Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. They are intelligent dogs and need a lot of mental stimulation when young. If left alone for long hours, they can be bored and become destructive.<ref>{{cite web|title=The VIZSLA|url=http://www.hungarianvizslaclub.org.uk/owning/the-vizsla/|accessdate = 15 September 2015}}</ref> With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that can be great around children.

Records of letters and writings show the high esteem in which the Vizsla was held.\n\nThe Vizsla has survived the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] (1526\u20131696), the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and the [[Hungarian People's Republic]]. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near-extinctions in their history, including being overrun by [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]]s and [[German Shorthaired Pointer]]s in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near-extinction after World War II.<ref name=\"boggs\"/> A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various \"strains\" of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas are commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia.\n\nThe Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain AKC recognition. As a result of registering foundation stock with the [[American Kennel Club|AKC]], Vizsla owners were able to obtain official recognition on 25 November 1960, as the Vizsla became the 115th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club.<ref name=\"vca\"/>\n\nThe Vizsla was used in development of other breeds, most notably the [[Weimaraner]], [[Wirehaired Vizsla]] and [[German Shorthaired Pointer]] breeds.<ref name=\"boggs\"/> There is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other [[Pointing breeds|pointer breeds]], being used to reestablish the Vizsla breed at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"boggs\"/>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Vizsla standing Rosie harness.jpg|The Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise and interaction\nFile:Vizsla dog in grass.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n=== Vizsla in the UK ===\nApproximately 4,520 Vizsla puppies are registered with the Kennel Club of Great Britain (KC) each year, making the breed one of the top 50 most popular.
