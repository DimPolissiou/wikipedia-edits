Directed by [[Guy Ritchie]], from a script he co-wrote with [[John August]], it is a [[live-action]] adaptation of Disney's [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|1992 animated film of the same name]], which itself is based on the [[Aladdin|eponymous tale]] from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>{{efn|name=Origins}} The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Mena Massoud]], [[Naomi Scott]], [[Marwan Kenzari]], [[Navid Negahban]], [[Nasim Pedrad]], [[Billy Magnussen]], and [[Numan Acar]], as well as the voices of [[Alan Tudyk]] and [[Frank Welker]]. The plot follows [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], a street urchin, as he falls in love with [[Princess Jasmine]], befriends a wish-granting [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], and battles the wicked [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]].\n\nIn October 2016, Disney announced Ritchie would direct a live-action ''Aladdin'' remake. Smith was the first member of the cast to join, signing on to portray Genie in July 2017, and Massoud and Scott were confirmed for the two lead roles later that month. [[Principal photography]] began that September at [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England, also filming in the [[Wadi Rum|Wadi Rum Desert]] in Jordan, and lasted until January 2018. Additional filming and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] took place in August 2018.\n\n''Aladdin'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 24, 2019. It grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->34th<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!--> highest-grossing film of all-time]] during its theatrical run. The film received mixed reviews from critics; while the musical score, costumes and performances of Smith, Massoud and Scott were praised, criticisms were aimed at Ritchie's direction, the CGI effects, the deviations from the original film and Kenzari's performance as Jafar.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| title=\u2018Aladdin\u2019 Remake Rubs Critics Differently, From \u2018Rip-Roaring Spectacle\u2019 to \u2018Cinematic Karaoke\u2019| author=Brian Welk| website=[[TheWrap]]| date=May 22, 2019| accessdate=May 22, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522183634/https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| archive-date=May 22, 2019| url-status=live}}</ref> A sequel is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nAladdin, a kind-hearted [[street urchin]], living in the Arabian city of Agrabah along with his pet [[monkey]] Abu, rescues and befriends Princess Jasmine, who has snuck out of the palace to explore, tired of her sheltered life. Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie / Mariner]]: <br />A comedically eccentric and kindly [[jinn]] who has the power to grant three wishes to whoever possesses his magic lamp.

Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie / Mariner]]: <br />A comedically eccentric and kindly [[jinn]] who has the power to grant three wishes to whoever possesses his magic lamp.

Over 2,000 actors and actresses had auditioned for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine, but finding a male lead of Middle Eastern or Indian descent in his 20s, who could act and sing, had proven difficult for the producers. [[Naomi Scott]] and [[Tara Sutaria]] were the final two actresses in the running for the role of Jasmine, but neither could be cast until a chemistry test was done with whomever would be cast as Aladdin.

The field was a mixed-use facility utilized by both the football and baseball teams. [[Bleacher]] seating for 4,000 persons were added in 1901, with field drainage added the following year to alleviate flooding.\n\nIn 1904, a [[track and field]] component was added to the athletic facility; however, conditions of the field continued to be a problem for the Hoosiers. The track and field portion of Jordan Field was upgraded in 1915. A proposed stadium, north of the current facility, was planned by the university; however, the outbreak of [[World War I]] postponed construction. The football and baseball teams would continue play at Jordan Field through the end of 1923. The proposed stadium would begin construction in 1924 and would open in the [[1925 Indiana Hoosiers football team|fall of 1925]]. The final varsity athletic event for Jordan Field, a baseball game, would occur in 1950 prior to the facility being turned into a parking lot for the nearby [[Indiana Memorial Union]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Field of Dreams \u2013 Jordan Field|url=https://indiana.rivals.com/news/field-of-dreams-4|publisher=Indiana.Rivals.com|year=2009|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Memorial Stadium (1925\u20131959)===\n{{Main|Tenth Street Stadium}}\nIndiana's two Memorial Stadiums are entirely distinct venues and share only the same name, though never at the same time.

It was demolished in the same year and its former place on campus is currently occupied by the arboretum.

The field was a mixed-use facility utilized by both the football and baseball teams. [[Bleacher]] seating for 4,000 persons were added in 1901, with field drainage added the following year to alleviate flooding.\n\nIn 1904, a [[track and field]] component was added to the athletic facility; however, conditions of the field continued to be a problem for the Hoosiers. The track and field portion of Jordan Field was upgraded in 1915. A proposed stadium, north of the current facility, was planned by the university; however, the outbreak of [[World War I]] postponed construction. The football and baseball teams would continue play at Jordan Field through the end of 1923. The proposed stadium would begin construction in 1924 and would open in the [[1925 Indiana Hoosiers football team|fall of 1925]]. The final varsity athletic event for Jordan Field, a baseball game, would occur in 1950 prior to the facility being turned into a parking lot for the nearby [[Indiana Memorial Union]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Field of Dreams \u2013 Jordan Field|url=https://indiana.rivals.com/news/field-of-dreams-4|publisher=Indiana.Rivals.com|year=2009|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Memorial Stadium (1925\u20131959)===\n{{Main|Tenth Street Stadium}}\nIndiana's two Memorial Stadiums are entirely distinct venues and share only the same name, though never at the same time.

It was demolished in the same year and its former place on campus is currently occupied by the arboretum.

{"title_page": "Technological dualism", "text_new": "'''Technological dualism''' was proposed by Benjamin Higgins. He was the Ritchie Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne in the late 1940s. His theory explains the causes of unemployment in the underdeveloped economies. Developing countries of today are often characterized by dualistic economies. One is the modern (or formal) sector while the other is the traditional (informal) sector. Their relation has been explained by Higgins in his theory explained below.\n\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n\n==Technological dualism==\n\nThe theory of technological dualism comes under the subject of [[development economics]]. This theory was propounded by Benjamin Higgins in place of [[Social dualism]] theory by Professor Boeke. In the words of Prof Higgins \"dualism is the situation in which productive employment opportunities are limited not because of lack of effective [[demand]] but because of resource and technological constraints in the two sector\". The two sector here means the traditional rural sector and modern sector.\nThis theory is prevalent in less developed countries. According to Prof Higgins this is the cause of unemployment and underemployment in these less developed countries. The traditional rural sector and the modern sector both use different production function and have different resource endowments and this is the reason for technological dualism in these less developed economies.<ref>{{cite book|last=ghatak|first=subrata|title=Development Economcs|year=2010|publisher=Longman Publishing Group|location=harlow|isbn=0-582-44873-5}}</ref>\n\n== Explanation of technological dualism ==\n\nThere are two fundamental basis of technological dualism\n\n=== Difference in production function ===\nThere are differences in the production function in the two sectors. There are fixed technical coefficients in the modern sector whereas in case of traditional sector the technical coefficients are variable. This duality is analyzed by Higgins in the context of Factor Proportions. Prof Eckaus offers a detailed explanation of this feature. This will be explained later on in this topic. This concept of Factor Proportion is used by Higgins for the analysis of the unemployment in the underdeveloped countries.\n\n=== Difference in factor-endowment ===\nThere is a difference in availability of labour and capital this forms the fundamental basis of technological dualism. In the modern sector more amount of capital than labour is observed so therefore capital intensive techniques would be used. In the traditional sector more of labour is present than capital. So here labour-intensive techniques will be incorporated. Thus two distinct techniques of production can be observed in these two sectors.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n==Features of dual sector==\n\nAs mentioned above in case of technological dualism the economy is divided into traditional sector and modern sector. Following are some characteristics of these sector.\n\n===Traditional sector===\n\n1) Agriculture, [[cottage industries]] and small industries are the main occupations of this sector.\n\n2) Different techniques and combinations are used in this sector. It has variable technical coefficients of production. As technical coefficients are variable the products can be produced with a wide range of techniques and combinations of labour and capital.\n\n3) As it is a traditional sector and [[factor endowment]] is such that [[labour-intensive]] technique is dominating in this sector as compared to [[capital intensive]] technique of production.<ref name=\"Development Economics\">{{cite book|last=Jain|first=TR|title=Development Economics|year=October 2009|publisher=F.K Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-87140-86-0|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\n===Modern sector===\n\n1) Large-scale industries, plantation, transport, oil fields are the main occupation in this sector.\n\n2) As it is the modern Sector hence [[capital intensive]] production is prevalent.\n\n3) Different techniques and combination are not used. The technical coefficients in this sector is fixed due to this different techniques or combination cannot be used.\n\n4) There is a limited degree of technical substitutability of factors and the production is characterized by fixed technical coefficients.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n==Production function in industrial/modern sector==\n\nTwo factors of production (labour and capital) and two goods is the assumption taken to show the technological dualism in the two sectors.\n\n[[File:Industrial 22.jpg|left|400px|Capital against Labor graph depicting the industrial production function.]]\n\nThe production function in the industrial sector is shown. The horizontal axis depicts Labour and the vertical axis is Capital. The curves which are [[isoquant]]s show the combination of labour and capital at some given level of output. The higher the curve the higher the levels of output i.e. O1 level of output is least and as you go to O2, O3, O4 the output level increases. The dotted line Pi shows the expansion path of the modern sector. From the figure 1 we can see that the production process is capital intensive. For instance, to get an output of O1 then OC1 amount of capital will be used and OL1 units of labour will be employed. If OL2 units are available the excess supply of labour would not have any effect on production techniques and L1L2 (excess labour) will remain unemployed or will try to seek employment in the traditional sector. This proves that only when the capital increases more labour will be taken in and output will be expanded. In this case the labour and capital have to be used in fixed proportion to get any output. As we know the production process is [[capital intensive]]. Figure 1 shows that OC1 units of capital is used and OL1 units of labour is employed to get Q1 units of output. if the availability of capital increases the producer would shift to the higher isoquant curve showing higher level of output. Huggins argues that the technical coefficients are not as rigidly fixed and therefore the small slanting dotted lines where two isoquants meet in the figure above show that they are somewhat flexible.f there are very large differences in the factor endowments such as given by CoLn the [[entrepreneurs]] would probably think of using more labour-intensive technique. The slope of the [[expansion path]] (Pi) shows that despite the increase in capital and output there is no significant improvement in the employment.<ref name=\"development mishra\" />\n\n==Production function in traditional/agriculture sector==\n\nThe technical [[coefficients]] in the traditional sector is variable. The unemployed labour in the industrial sector will have no option but to look for employment in the traditional sector. As traditional sector is labour-intensive therefore the inflow in labour can be absorbed in this sector as the technical coefficients are variable.\n\nInitially this absorption takes place by getting more land under cultivation so as to keep the ratio of labour to land constant.  For sometime the capital and labour combination remain constant as the output rises from O1 to O3 as given in Figure 2.  As resources are not unlimited the good land tends to become scarce and due to inflow of labour the ratio of labour to capital in the sector rises and hence the techniques tend to become increasingly labour-intensive.  When the point On is reached all the available land has already been cultivated due to the high intensive labour techniques used and the marginal productivity of labour falls below zero. [[Disguised unemployment]] starts making an appearance at this point. Under these condition there is no incentive for farmers to or small industries to make an investment in this sector even if they have the money to invest. Nor will they be interested in introducing labour saving innovations even if they knew about them.  Since labour supply is in excess  therefore labour as a group is not interested in increasing their efforts.  Thus methods of production remain labour-intensive and economic and social welfare remain low.<ref name=\"development mishra\">{{cite book|last=puri|first=mishra|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=himalayan publishing house|location=Bombay|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=258\u2013260}}</ref>\n\nHiggins notes that the problem of [[disguised unemployment]] has become more and more serious in the rural sector during the last two centuries.  This happened as technological progress took a form of capital intensive sector and not technological progress took place in agriculture, handicrafts.  The technological progress has been rapid in modern sector.  Particularly after the second world war both he trade union activity and direct government intervention has led to increase in the industrial wage rates in certain countries but these policies have had no effect on the rural wage rate.  As a result, the tendency towards technological dualism has increased.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n== Factor proportion problem ==\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this topic we will discuss the factor proportion problem as incorporated by Prof Higgins in his theory.  This problem was discussed by Prof Eckaus in detail in his study.\nProf Eckaus begins with a simple case where one good is produced in the economy, national product, with two factors of production labour and capital.  It is assumed by him that the factors given are used in fixed proportions. Eckaus finds out that the relatively abundant factor i.e. labour faces structural unemployment. This happens even if the technique used is labour-intensive. So from his study it showed that structural unemployment of labour exists even when labour-intensive technique is used.\nIn the next step the national product is divided into two goods-one is output of local enterprises which are relatively more labour-intensive and output of western enterprises which are relatively more capital intensive.  Again the result is the same very high capital-labour ratio results in structural unemployment of labour.  This cannot be removed even if prce is adjusted, or by creation of increased effective demand.\nThis conclusion remains unchanged even if variable coefficients replace the fixed coefficients in the more labour-intensive field of employment.\nSome of the reasons for aggravation of these structural employment is\n1) If the technological progress takes a form of capital intensive sector.\n2) If the rate of population growth is higher than the rate of capital accumulation in the labour sector.\n3) If government policies or the trade union are able to increase the wages to a higher level.<ref name=\"development mishra\" />\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nHiggins in his theory of technological dualism shows us that technological dualism in underdeveloped countries is the cause of unemployment and disguised unemployment. He thinks that the development in the modern sector can take place if foreign capital is present in the economy. As a result of this industrialization in these economies do not cause capital formation instead they are associated with ever increase in population. This is the reason for unemployment in these under developed economies.\n\n==Critical evaluation==\nProf Higgins' theory is more realistic as compared to the Boeke theory of social dualism. His theory clearly explains the reasons for unemployment in the underdeveloped countries.

He was the Ritchie Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne in the late 1940s. His theory explains the causes of unemployment in the underdeveloped economies. Developing countries of today are often characterized by dualistic economies. One is the modern (or formal) sector while the other is the traditional (informal) sector. Their relation has been explained by Higgins in his theory explained below.\n\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n\n==Technological dualism==\n\nThe theory of technological dualism comes under the subject of [[development economics]]. This theory was propounded by Benjamin Higgins in place of [[Social dualism]] theory by Professor Boeke. In the words of Prof Higgins \"dualism is the situation in which productive employment opportunities are limited not because of lack of effective [[demand]] but because of resource and technological constraints in the two sector\". The two sector here means the traditional rural sector and modern sector.\nThis theory is prevalent in less developed countries. According to Prof Higgins this is the cause of unemployment and underemployment in these less developed countries. The traditional rural sector and the modern sector both use different production function and have different resource endowments and this is the reason for technological dualism in these less developed economies.<ref>{{cite book|last=ghatak|first=subrata|title=Development Economcs|year=2010|publisher=Longman Publishing Group|location=harlow|isbn=0-582-44873-5}}</ref>\n\n== Explanation of technological dualism ==\n\nThere are two fundamental basis of technological dualism\n\n=== Difference in production function ===\nThere are differences in the production function in the two sectors. There are fixed technical coefficients in the modern sector whereas in case of traditional sector the technical coefficients are variable. This duality is analyzed by Higgins in the context of Factor Proportions. Prof Eckaus offers a detailed explanation of this feature. This will be explained later on in this topic. This concept of Factor Proportion is used by Higgins for the analysis of the unemployment in the underdeveloped countries.\n\n=== Difference in factor-endowment ===\nThere is a difference in availability of labour and capital this forms the fundamental basis of technological dualism. In the modern sector more amount of capital than labour is observed so therefor capital intensive techniques would be used. In the traditional sector more of labour is present than capital. So here labour-intensive techniques will be incorporated. Thus two distinct techniques of production can be observed in these two sectors.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n==Features of dual sector==\n\nAs mentioned above in case of technological dualism the economy is divided into traditional sector and modern sector. Following are some characteristics of these sector.\n\n===Traditional sector===\n\n1) Agriculture, [[cottage industries]] and small industries are the main occupations of this sector.\n\n2) Different techniques and combinations are used in this sector. It has variable technical coefficients of production. As technical coefficients are variable the products can be produced with a wide range of techniques and combinations of labour and capital.\n\n3) As it is a traditional sector and [[factor endowment]] is such that [[labour-intensive]] technique is dominating in this sector as compared to [[capital intensive]] technique of production.<ref name=\"Development Economics\">{{cite book|last=Jain|first=TR|title=Development Economics|year=October 2009|publisher=F.K Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-87140-86-0|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\n===Modern sector===\n\n1) Large-scale industries, plantation, transport, oil fields are the main occupation in this sector.\n\n2) As it is the modern Sector hence [[capital intensive]] production is prevalent.\n\n3) Different techniques and combination are not used. The technical coefficients in this sector is fixed due to this different techniques or combination cannot be used.\n\n4) There is a limited degree of technical substitutability of factors and the production is characterized by fixed technical coefficients.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n==Production function in industrial/modern sector==\n\nTwo factors of production (labour and capital) and two goods is the assumption taken to show the technological dualism in the two sectors.\n\n[[File:Industrial 22.jpg|left|400px|Capital against Labor graph depicting the industrial production function.]]\n\nThe production function in the industrial sector is shown. The horizontal axis depicts Labour and the vertical axis is Capital. The curves which are [[isoquant]]s show the combination of labour and capital at some given level of output. The higher the curve the higher the levels of output i.e. O1 level of output is least and as you go to O2, O3, O4 the output level increases. The dotted line Pi shows the expansion path of the modern sector. From the figure 1 we can see that the production process is capital intensive. For instance, to get an output of O1 then OC1 amount of capital will be used and OL1 units of labour will be employed. If OL2 units are available the excess supply of labour would not have any effect on production techniques and L1L2 (excess labour) will remain unemployed or will try to seek employment in the traditional sector. This proves that only when the capital increases more labour will be taken in and output will be expanded. In this case the labour and capital have to be used in fixed proportion to get any output. As we know the production process is [[capital intensive]]. Figure 1 shows that OC1 units of capital is used and OL1 units of labour is employed to get Q1 units of output. if the availability of capital increases the producer would shift to the higher isoquant curve showing higher level of output. Huggins argues that the technical coefficients are not as rigidly fixed and therefore the small slanting dotted lines where two isoquants meet in the figure above show that they are somewhat flexible.f there are very large differences in the factor endowments such as given by CoLn the [[entrepreneurs]] would probably think of using more labour-intensive technique. The slope of the [[expansion path]] (Pi) shows that despite the increase in capital and output there is no significant improvement in the employment.<ref name=\"development mishra\" />\n\n==Production function in traditional/agriculture sector==\n\nThe technical [[coefficients]] in the traditional sector is variable. The unemployed labour in the industrial sector will have no option but to look for employment in the traditional sector. As traditional sector is labour-intensive therefore the inflow in labour can be absorbed in this sector as the technical coefficients are variable.\n\nInitially this absorption takes place by getting more land under cultivation so as to keep the ratio of labour to land constant.  For sometime the capital and labour combination remain constant as the output rises from O1 to O3 as given in Figure 2.  As resources are not unlimited the good land tends to become scarce and due to inflow of labour the ratio of labour to capital in the sector rises and hence the techniques tend to become increasingly labour-intensive.  When the point On is reached all the available land has already been cultivated due to the high intensive labour techniques used and the marginal productivity of labour falls below zero. [[Disguised unemployment]] starts making an appearance at this point. Under these condition there is no incentive for farmers to or small industries to make an investment in this sector even if they have the money to invest. Nor will they be interested in introducing labour saving innovations even if they knew about them.  Since labour supply is in excess  therefore labour as a group is not interested in increasing their efforts.  Thus methods of production remain labour-intensive and economic and social welfare remain low.<ref name=\"development mishra\">{{cite book|last=puri|first=mishra|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=himalayan publishing house|location=Bombay|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=258\u2013260}}</ref>\n\nHiggins notes that the problem of [[disguised unemployment]] has become more and more serious in the rural sector during the last two centuries.  This happened as technological progress took a form of capital intensive sector and not technological progress took place in agriculture, handicrafts.  The technological progress has been rapid in modern sector.  Particularly after the second world war both he trade union activity and direct government intervention has led to increase in the industrial wage rates in certain countries but these policies have had no effect on the rural wage rate.  As a result, the tendency towards technological dualism has increased.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n== Factor proportion problem ==\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this topic we will discuss the factor proportion problem as incorporated by Prof Higgins in his theory.  This problem was discussed by Prof Eckaus in detail in his study.\nProf Eckaus begins with a simple case where one good is produced in the economy, national product, with two factors of production labour and capital.  It is assumed by him that the factors given are used in fixed proportions. Eckaus finds out that the relatively abundant factor i.e. labour faces structural unemployment. This happens even if the technique used is labour-intensive. So from his study it showed that structural unemployment of labour exists even when labour-intensive technique is used.\nIn the next step the national product is divided into two goods-one is output of local enterprises which are relatively more labour-intensive and output of western enterprises which are relatively more capital intensive.  Again the result is the same very high capital-labour ratio results in structural unemployment of labour.  This cannot be removed even if prce is adjusted, or by creation of increased effective demand.\nThis conclusion remains unchanged even if variable coefficients replace the fixed coefficients in the more labour-intensive field of employment.\nSome of the reasons for aggravation of these structural employment is\n1) If the technological progress takes a form of capital intensive sector.\n2) If the rate of population growth is higher than the rate of capital accumulation in the labour sector.\n3) If government policies or the trade union are able to increase the wages to a higher level.<ref name=\"development mishra\" />\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nHiggins in his theory of technological dualism shows us that technological dualism in underdeveloped countries is the cause of unemployment and disguised unemployment. He thinks that the development in the modern sector can take place if foreign capital is present in the economy. As a result of this industrialization in these economies do not cause capital formation instead they are associated with ever increase in population. This is the reason for unemployment in these under developed economies.\n\n==Critical evaluation==\nProf Higgins' theory is more realistic as compared to the Boeke theory of social dualism. His theory clearly explains the reasons for unemployment in the underdeveloped countries. Higgins' theory is not free of criticism; some of the criticisms are given below:\n\n1) Higgins fails to offer an explanation of nature and growth of unemployment in the traditional sector in the dual society\n\n2) It is questionable to assume that development of the industrial sector is dependent entirely on imported technology.\n\n3) He gives importance to only technical factors affecting labour and capital whereas social and psychological factors are completely ignored.\n\n4) His theory is based on the assumption that technical coefficients are fixed in the modern sector.  However a little degree of elasticity cannot be ruled out completely. This makes his assumption questionable.\n\n5) The theory explains the underemployment in the traditional sector but it does not provide a solution.<ref name=\"Development Economics\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Partial Theories of Development-footer}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.professor-frithjof-kuhnen.de/publications/causes-of-underdevelopment/1-1.htm\n* https://www.scribd.com/doc/47449015/TECHNOLOGICAL-DUALISM-AGRICULTURE-AND-THE-UNEMPLOYMENT-PROBLEM-OF-DEVELOPING-ECONOMIES-Egbe-B-E-1-Ogar-A-M-2-Ibrahim-M-K-3-and-Albert-A-T\n* http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2719/6/06_abstract.pdf\n* http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2719/17/17_chapter%2010.pdf\n* https://books.google.com/books?id=l6WfYYhvrC4C&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=technological+dualism+Professor+Higgins&source=bl&ots=Q-aEqJARDE&sig=5JfeKV0Cqyori7-jcK30XoWvaus&hl=en&ei=20-UTpu5LaqOmQW14KXlBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false\n* http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2719/17/17_chapter%2010.pdf\n\n[[Category:Microeconomic theories]]\n[[Category:Development economics]]\n[[Category:Unemployment]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDifference in factor-endowment:Typo fixing, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_dualism"}
