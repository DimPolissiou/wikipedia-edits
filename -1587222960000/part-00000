This duty is so prestigious that the colour is generally carried by a young officer ([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]), while experienced non-commissioned officers ([[colour sergeant]]s) are assigned to the protection of the flag. These NCOs, accompanied sometimes by warrant officers (as is the case in several countries), can be ceremonially armed with either [[sabre]]s or [[rifle]]s to protect the colour. Colour guards are generally dismounted, but there are also mounted colour guard formations as well.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mazurovsky - Fight for the banner (1805), 1910-12.jpg|thumb|upright|Fight for the flag between French [[line infantry]] and [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Russian Guard]] [[cuirassier]]s at the [[battle of Austerlitz]] (1805).]]\n{{Main|Military colours, standards and guidons}}\nAs armies became trained and adopted set formations, each [[regiment|regiment's]] ability to keep its formation was potentially critical to its, and therefore its army's, success. In the chaos of battle, not least due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was. Flags and banners have been used by many armies in battle to serve this purpose.\n\nRegimental flags were generally awarded to a regiment by a head-of-State during a ceremony and colours may be inscribed with [[battle honours]] or other symbols representing former achievements. They were therefore treated with reverence as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. The loss of a unit's flag was not only shameful, but losing this central point of reference could make the unit break up. So regiments tended to adopt colour guards, a detachment of experienced or \u00e9lite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy's standard was considered as a great feat of arms.\n\nDue to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, colours are no longer used in battle, but continue to be carried by colour guards at events of formal character.\n\n==Current use==\n===Commonwealth of Nations===\n[[File:Presentation of Colours March Off RRC.JPG|thumb|left|The old colours of the [[Royal Regiment of Canada]] are marched off by colour guards, during the presentation of new colours to the regiment.]]\nColour guards are used in the military throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including [[Australia]], [[Canada]]<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/caf/military-identity-system/drill-manual/chapter-8.html#1-7</ref>, [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. A colour guard unit typically consists of the [[standard-bearer]], who is of the rank of [[second lieutenant]] or equivalent (pilot officer or sub-lieutenant), positioned in the centre of the colour guard, flanked by two or more individuals, typically armed with rifles or sabres. A colour sergeant major typically stands behind the colours carrying a [[pace stick]]. So, the formation (when the colours are combined on parade) is as follows:\n\n* Colour Sergeants carrying rifles\n* Ensigns\n* Sergeant of the Guard\n* Colour Sergeant Major behind the colour\n\nAside from [[Present arms (command)|presenting arms]] and sabres,  colour guards of the Commonwealth of Nations are expected to lower their flags to the ground in full and regular salutes in ceremonies and parades. Civilians should stand during such times and soldiers are expected to salute them when not in formation.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAs the British Army, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy have several types of colours, there are also colour guards for these colours and these colours and their colour guards are as follows:\n\n=====British Army (infantry)=====\n[[File:Colour Sergeant, Welsh Guards, with pace stick.jpg|thumb|upright|Colour Sergeant of the [[Welsh Guards]].

Today, only honor guards are granted colour guard duty to represent the whole of the PLA. Being the seniormost branch of the PLA, the [[PLA Ground Forces|Ground Forces]] representative serves as the ensign in the service colour guard, with the officer to his/her right being from the Navy and the officer to their left being from the Air Force.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Y06bCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=guard+of+honor+of+the+pla+hong+kong+garrison&source=bl&ots=pBCf6Wc8o1&sig=ACfU3U2RPVHQmstzLEGClQBnCIyHGk05NQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHv4uaxr_lAhXQWhUIHTobDts4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=guard%20of%20honor%20of%20the%20pla%20hong%20kong%20garrison&f=false</ref>  Since 1981, the PLA has continued a tradition of the colour guard detail with the PLA flag leading the [[Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion]] in military parades. In December 2017, the Beijing Garrison Colour Guard Company of the [[People's Armed Police]], which is present during flag ceremonies in Tiananmen Square in Beijing carrying the national flag, was officially attached to the honor guard battalion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.waonews.com/news/1436-The_historical_moment_Armed_Police_Tiananmen_flag_guard_cancel_the_designation_to_history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421234239/https://www.waonews.com/news/1436-The_historical_moment_Armed_Police_Tiananmen_flag_guard_cancel_the_designation_to_history.html |archive-date=2018-04-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Republic of China  (Taiwan) ===\nIn Taiwan, the colour guard tradition of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] is modeled on the German, Russian and US practice. Until 1976, each military unit sported a singular stand of colours on parade, as opposed to the honor guard of the ROCAF, which is more aligned with the traditions of the US Joint Service Honor Guard of the [[Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region]]. All colour bearers of formations above company level must be, following US tradition, holding the rank of sergeant or above as a non-commissioned officer, while the colour escorts are lower ranking enlisted personnel. Since the National Day parade of 1978, the format of unit colour guards in ROCAF formations of battalion size (and of equivalent formations) is:\n\n* Left escort\n* 1st 2 company guidon bearers\n* Unit colour\n* 2nd 2 company guidon bearers \n* Right escort\n\nBrigade-level colours (and above) are guided by the left and right escorts only.\n\nThe joint service colour guard of the ROCAF General Headquarters, today as in the past, is similarly composed but is more larger, with its composition being\n\n* Left escort\n* Air Force Flag\n* Naval Jack\n* Army Flag\n* [[Flag of the Republic of China]] (National Colour)\n* Army Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Navy Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Air Force Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Right escort\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t113201.jpg|left|thumb|A mounted French colour guard]]\nFrench colour guards are composed of:\n\n* One ensign holding the [[flag of France]] as the national colour\n* Two non-commissioned officers assisting the ensign \n* Three enlisted personnel behind to guard the colour\n\nThe colour guards of France's military academies tend to wear swords; those of NCO schools, other educational institutions and active units carry rifles instead. This design is used in other countries with Francophone populations.\n\nFrench colour guards render honors on the command of [[present arms (command)|present arms]] (pr\u00e9sentez arme). On command, the 2 NCOs and 3 enlisted will execute present arms, whether it be by presenting their sabre vertically or by putting the right hand over the handle of their weapon while the ensign lowers the national colour/unit colour somewhere close to their legs. On some occasions, the flag is not lowered unless the guard is in the presence of a dignitary (such as the [[President of the Republic]]) or a military leader (such as the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]).\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n{{See also|Military colours, standards and guidons #Indonesia}}\n[[File:Indonesian army colour guard.png|thumb|upright|An [[Indonesian Army]] colour guard]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], the Colour guard is known as \"'Pataka'\" an abbreviation from ''\"Pasukan Tanda Kehormatan\"'' which is the term used in various uniformed institutions including the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], the [[Indonesian National Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Indonesia)|Municipal Police Units]], etc. referring to the white-uniformed 9-man or 12-man guard present during ceremonial events carrying and escorting the [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] of the institution. The Pataka are modeled from the former Dutch practice and is led by a Colour sergeant positioned at the middle of the guard (rear of the ensign), while the [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] who carries the [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] is usually a junior [[lieutenant]] (2nd Lieutenant or Ensign). For a [[battalion]] level, the Colour is carried by a [[Sergeant]]/[[chief petty officer]].\n\n'''Composition of the Indonesian colour guard unit'''\n* Colour officer\n* Lead squad carrying the unit colour or national flag\n** One colour sergeant/ensign\n** Two non-commissioned officers escorting the colour\n* Relief squad \n** One replacement colour sergeant/ensign\n** Two non-commissioned officers\n* Rear guard squad of three enlisted personnel (2 squads of 3-4 in the [[Indonesian Marine Corps]])\n\nThe uniform of the colour guard is basically all-white, with a white ceremonial combat helmet similar to the [[M1 helmet]], white [[full dress uniform]], white leather flag carrier worn by the ensign, and white parade boots. The colour guard personnel of the Armed Forces and the National Police usually carries the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, but sometimes the [[M16 rifle|M-16]], [[FN FAL]] or [[Pindad SS1]] rifle is used.\n\n===Mexico===\nIn [[Mexico]], an ''Escolta de la bandera'' or ''Escolta'' is used to describe colour guards and flag parties in the [[Spanish language]]. In Mexico these formations are made up of six individuals: the flag party commander and the escort proper of around 5, following the French practice. In the Mexican Armed Forces, National Guard and state police formations the colour escort squad is made up of:\n\n* Ensign carrying the [[Flag of Mexico]] as National Colour (Infantry and other units)/National Standard (Cavalry and Artillery (the latter in the Army only))\n* 2 Escorts\n* Rear section of 2 escorts\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe Dutch armed forces have similar ranks corresponding to a colour guard, the ''vaandrig'' and ''kornet'' (aspirant officers who have not been sworn in yet). The color guard practice mirrors that of the United Kingdom, with an ensign of second lieutenant rank (or equivalent), armed escorts, and a colour guard commander.\n\n=== Post-Soviet states ===\n[[File:US Navy 100510-N-8288P-022 A Russian honor guard marches during the opening ceremony of the 65th anniversary of the Victory in Europe Day parade.jpg|thumb|Colour Guard of the  [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] at the 2010 Victory Day Parade in [[St. Petersburg]].]]\nThe practices of the colour guards for the armed forces of a number of [[post-Soviet states]] are similar to one another, adopting the practice from the former [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. Colour guards from these states are typically composed of a colour officer, one ensign or senior NCO holding the flag of their respective country as the national colour or the unit colour, and two enlisted personnel assisting the ensign. Active units, military academies, and guards of honor carry sabers in the colour guard, if needed, rifles may be substituted.\n\nIf there are multiple colour guards marching in a parade at the same time, one guard is required to march directly behind the first guard. During the Soviet era, the [[Soviet flag]] was never allowed to be paraded by a military colour guard, with military and regimental flags only being paraded in colour guards. On occasion during the Soviet era, the [[Victory Banner]] was also used in colour guard teams, with the last known occasions being in 1975, 1977, 1985, 1987 and 1990.\n\nHowever, several post-Soviet armed forces have deviated/modified the practices of the former Soviet colour guard; evident with the colour guards of the [[Turkmen Ground Forces]], and the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]], whose colour guards dip their flags as a form of salute.\n\nThe customs practiced by the colour guards of the former Soviet Armed Forces was also adopted by the [[Mongolian Armed Forces]], given the [[Mongolia\u2013Russia relations|historical relationship]] between the two countries.\n\n=== Serbia ===\nGiven a shared heritage with Austria and Turkey plus its own traditions, the modern Serbian Armed Forces maintains a colour guard component. Every unit of the Armed Forces has a colour company that is made up of:\n\n* Colour company commander\n* Colour guard\n** One ensign\n** 2 armed senior NCOs serving as colour escorts\n* 2 honor guard platoons guarding the colour from the rear\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:Riksmotet2011 1c568 9303.jpg|thumb|Swedish ceremonial colour guard at the opening of the [[Riksdag]] in 2011.]]\nIn Sweden the colour guard can be composed in three distinct manners: Greater colour guard, smaller colour guard and an officers guard. Each regiment, or military unit that carries a colour, in Sweden sets up its own colour guard. The Swedish military rank of [[f\u00e4nrik]] (and the corresponding cavalry rank of ''kornet'') was originally intended for the holder of the company flag. This duty was considered so prestigious that an officer was necessary to carry it out. Today, it is a regular officer rank.\n\n====Greater colour guard====\nThis is composed of two commissioned officers, called ''fanf\u00f6rare'' (''carriers of the colour'') and eight enlisted soldiers. This stems from the time of king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]] when all Swedish regiments had eight battalions. Each battalion contributed one soldier to the common colour guard.\n\n====Small colour guard====\nThis is composed of one commissioned officer and four enlisted soldiers.\n\n====Officers guard====\nThis is composed of three commissioned officers.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[military of the United States]], the ''color guard'' (where the word ''color'' is referring to the national flag) carries the [[Colours, standards and guidons#United States|national colour]] and other [[flag]]s appropriate to its position in the [[chain of command]]. Typically these include a [[Military unit|unit]] flag and a departmental flag ([[United States Department of the Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]], [[United States Department of the Air Force|Air Force]], or [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]). In addition to the flag bearers, who are positioned in the center of the color guard, there are two or more individuals who carry [[rifle]]s and or [[sabre]]s. This is a symbol that the flag (and its nation) will always be protected.\n\n====Composition of the US color guard====\n[[File:2009 Non-commissioned Officer Parade DVIDS173390.jpg|thumb|A color guard detachment from the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in full dress.

The sergeant major is also responsible for the selection, training, and performance of the members.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (e)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref> The color guard consists of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] members and is commanded by the senior (color) [[Sergeant]], who carries the National Color and gives the necessary commands for movements and rendering honors during drill exercises or [[parade]] ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 45 (a)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref>\n\nBeing assigned to the color guard is considered an honor due to the fact that these individuals present and carry the symbols of their unit and country. Depending on the circumstance and subject to the orders of their commander, members may wear [[Dress uniform|full dress]] or less formal [[Military uniform|uniforms]]. It is mandatory for all members of the color guard to wear headgear, for example, a [[garrison cap]], [[beret]], or [[service cap]]. On occasion, certain color guards can be [[horse]]-[[Riding animal#Riding animals or mounts|mounted]].\n\nA US color guard is made up of a \"Color Sergeant\" carrying the National Colors and serves as the unit commander, a unit or command \"Color Bearer\", and two \"Color Escorts\" carrying rifles and/or sabres. If multiple colors are carried, multiple color bearers may be needed.\n\n====Manoeuvering====\nThe color guard is formed and marched in one rank at close interval (shoulder-to-shoulder). Since the National Colors must always be in the position of honor on the right,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/FM_3-21.5_Drill_and_Ceremonies.pdf |title=FM 3-21.5 (FM 22-5) Drill and Ceremonies |last1=Morrow |first1=JoyceE. |last2=Schoomaker |first2=Peter K. |date=July 2003 |website=Center of Military History |publisher=United States Army |page=K-3 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> the color guard must execute a special movement to reverse direction. It does not execute rear march, nor does it execute about face. Rather, it performs a maneuver derived from the standard countercolumn command, generally known as ''counter march'' or ''colors reverse march'', in order to keep the precedence of flags in order.\nOther drill movements performed by the color guard include [[Salute#Small arms salutes|presenting arms]], left and right wheel (turns) marches, eyes right (upon passing the reviewing stand during a parade), [[Casing of the Colors|casing/uncasing the colors]], and fixing/unfixing [[bayonet]]s (by the arms bearers).\n\n====Rendering honors====\n=====By the color guard=====\n[[File:USMC Color Guard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States Marine Corps]] color guard during the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". Note that the national flag does not dip.]]\nThe color guard renders honors when the national anthem is played or sung, when passing in review during a parade, or in certain other circumstances. In these cases, the unit and departmental flags salute by dipping (leaning the flag forward). However, with the exception of a response to a naval salute, the United States national flag renders no salute. This is enshrined in the [[United States Flag Code]] and U.S. law.\n\n=====To the color guard=====\nIn the U.S. military, individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased (unfurled) colors render honors when outdoors. Individuals who are not part of any formation begin the hand salute when the colors are six paces distant and hold it until they have passed six paces beyond the colors.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (c)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref>\n\nCivilians are expected to stand at the position of attention with their right hand placed over their heart for the same period, and the hand salute applies to uniformed organizations as well (specifically the Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of America). Since recently, veterans are expected to hand salute the colors too, like their military counterparts including personnel not in uniform.\n\n== See also==\n* [[Guard of honour]]\n* [[Presentation of Colours]]\n* [[Trooping the Colour]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Colour guards}}\n*[http://www.oldguard.mdw.army.mil/specialty-platoons/continental-color-guard Continental Color Guard of The Old Guard]\n* [http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%202.aspx MCO P5060.20 US Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual] Chapter 7\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060516151759/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=3905 U.

Today, only honor guards are granted colour guard duty to represent the whole of the PLA. Being the seniormost branch of the PLA, the [[PLA Ground Forces|Ground Forces]] representative serves as the ensign in the service colour guard, with the officer to his/her right being from the Navy and the officer to their left being from the Air Force.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Y06bCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=guard+of+honor+of+the+pla+hong+kong+garrison&source=bl&ots=pBCf6Wc8o1&sig=ACfU3U2RPVHQmstzLEGClQBnCIyHGk05NQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHv4uaxr_lAhXQWhUIHTobDts4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=guard%20of%20honor%20of%20the%20pla%20hong%20kong%20garrison&f=false</ref>  Since 1981, the PLA has continued a tradition of the colour guard detail with the PLA flag leading the [[Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion]] in military parades. In December 2017, the Beijing Garrison Colour Guard Company of the [[People's Armed Police]], which is present during flag ceremonies in Tiananmen Square in Beijing carrying the national flag, was officially attached to the honor guard battalion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.waonews.com/news/1436-The_historical_moment_Armed_Police_Tiananmen_flag_guard_cancel_the_designation_to_history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421234239/https://www.waonews.com/news/1436-The_historical_moment_Armed_Police_Tiananmen_flag_guard_cancel_the_designation_to_history.html |archive-date=2018-04-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Republic of China  (Taiwan) ===\nIn Taiwan, the colour guard tradition of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] is modeled on the German, Russian and US practice. Until 1976, each military unit sported a singular stand of colours on parade, as opposed to the honor guard of the ROCAF, which is more aligned with the traditions of the US Joint Service Honor Guard of the [[Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region]]. All colour bearers of formations above company level must be, following US tradition, holding the rank of sergeant or above as a non-commissioned officer, while the colour escorts are lower ranking enlisted personnel. Since the National Day parade of 1978, the format of unit colour guards in ROCAF formations of battalion size (and of equivalent formations) is:\n\n* Left escort\n* 1st 2 company guidon bearers\n* Unit colour\n* 2nd 2 company guidon bearers \n* Right escort\n\nBrigade-level colours (and above) are guided by the left and right escorts only.\n\nThe joint service colour guard of the ROCAF General Headquarters, today as in the past, is similarly composed but is more larger, with its composition being\n\n* Left escort\n* Air Force Flag\n* Naval Jack\n* Army Flag\n* [[Flag of the Republic of China]] (National Colour)\n* Army Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Navy Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Air Force Honor Guard Unit Colour\n* Right escort\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t113201.jpg|left|thumb|A mounted French colour guard]]\nFrench colour guards are composed of:\n\n* One ensign holding the [[flag of France]] as the national colour\n* Two non-commissioned officers assisting the ensign \n* Three enlisted personnel behind to guard the colour\n\nThe colour guards of France's military academies tend to wear swords; those of NCO schools, other educational institutions and active units carry rifles instead. This design is used in other countries with Francophone populations.\n\nFrench colour guards render honors on the command of [[present arms (command)|present arms]] (pr\u00e9sentez arme). On command, the 2 NCOs and 3 enlisted will execute present arms, whether it be by presenting their sabre vertically or by putting the right hand over the handle of their weapon while the ensign lowers the national colour/unit colour somewhere close to their legs. On some occasions, the flag is not lowered unless the guard is in the presence of a dignitary (such as the [[President of the Republic]]) or a military leader (such as the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]).\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n{{See also|Military colours, standards and guidons #Indonesia}}\n[[File:Indonesian army colour guard.png|thumb|upright|An [[Indonesian Army]] colour guard]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], the Colour guard is known as \"'Pataka'\" an abbreviation from ''\"Pasukan Tanda Kehormatan\"'' which is the term used in various uniformed institutions including the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], the [[Indonesian National Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Indonesia)|Municipal Police Units]], etc. referring to the white-uniformed 9-man or 12-man guard present during ceremonial events carrying and escorting the [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] of the institution. The Pataka are modeled from the former Dutch practice and is led by a Colour sergeant positioned at the middle of the guard (rear of the ensign), while the [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] who carries the [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] is usually a junior [[lieutenant]] (2nd Lieutenant or Ensign). For a [[battalion]] level, the Colour is carried by a [[Sergeant]]/[[chief petty officer]].\n\n'''Composition of the Indonesian colour guard unit'''\n* Colour officer\n* Lead squad carrying the unit colour or national flag\n** One colour sergeant/ensign\n** Two non-commissioned officers escorting the colour\n* Relief squad \n** One replacement colour sergeant/ensign\n** Two non-commissioned officers\n* Rear guard squad of three enlisted personnel (2 squads of 3-4 in the [[Indonesian Marine Corps]])\n\nThe uniform of the colour guard is basically all-white, with a white ceremonial combat helmet similar to the [[M1 helmet]], white [[full dress uniform]], white leather flag carrier worn by the ensign, and white parade boots. The colour guard personnel of the Armed Forces and the National Police usually carries the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, but sometimes the [[M16 rifle|M-16]], [[FN FAL]] or [[Pindad SS1]] rifle is used.\n\n===Mexico===\nIn [[Mexico]], an ''Escolta de la bandera'' or ''Escolta'' is used to describe colour guards and flag parties in the [[Spanish language]]. In Mexico these formations are made up of six individuals: the flag party commander and the escort proper of around 5, following the French practice. In the Mexican Armed Forces, National Guard and state police formations the colour escort squad is made up of:\n\n* Ensign carrying the [[Flag of Mexico]] as National Colour (Infantry and other units)/National Standard (Cavalry and Artillery (the latter in the Army only))\n* 2 Escorts\n* Rear section of 2 escorts\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe Dutch armed forces have similar ranks corresponding to a colour guard, the ''vaandrig'' and ''kornet'' (aspirant officers who have not been sworn in yet). The color guard practice mirrors that of the United Kingdom, with an ensign of second lieutenant rank (or equivalent), armed escorts, and a colour guard commander.\n\n=== Post-Soviet states ===\n[[File:US Navy 100510-N-8288P-022 A Russian honor guard marches during the opening ceremony of the 65th anniversary of the Victory in Europe Day parade.jpg|thumb|Colour Guard of the  [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] at the 2010 Victory Day Parade in [[St. Petersburg]].]]\nThe practices of the colour guards for the armed forces of a number of [[post-Soviet states]] are similar to one another, adopting the practice from the former [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. Colour guards from these states are typically composed of a colour officer, one ensign or senior NCO holding the flag of their respective country as the national colour or the unit colour, and two enlisted personnel assisting the ensign. Active units, military academies, and guards of honor carry sabers in the colour guard, if needed, rifles may be substituted.\n\nIf there are multiple colour guards marching in a parade at the same time, one guard is required to march directly behind the first guard. During the Soviet era, the [[Soviet flag]] was never allowed to be paraded by a military colour guard, with military and regimental flags only being paraded in colour guards. On occasion during the Soviet era, the [[Victory Banner]] was also used in colour guard teams, with the last known occasions being in 1975, 1977, 1985, 1987 and 1990.\n\nHowever, several post-Soviet armed forces have deviated/modified the practices of the former Soviet colour guard; evident with the colour guards of the [[Turkmen Ground Forces]], and the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]], whose colour guards dip their flags as a form of salute.\n\nThe customs practiced by the colour guards of the former Soviet Armed Forces was also adopted by the [[Mongolian Armed Forces]], given the [[Mongolia\u2013Russia relations|historical relationship]] between the two countries.\n\n=== Serbia ===\nGiven a shared heritage with Austria and Turkey plus its own traditions, the modern Serbian Armed Forces maintains a colour guard component. Every unit of the Armed Forces has a colour company that is made up of:\n\n* Colour company commander\n* Colour guard\n** One ensign\n** 2 armed senior NCOs serving as colour escorts\n* 2 honor guard platoons guarding the colour from the rear\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:Riksmotet2011 1c568 9303.jpg|thumb|Swedish ceremonial colour guard at the opening of the [[Riksdag]] in 2011.]]\nIn Sweden the colour guard can be composed in three distinct manners: Greater colour guard, smaller colour guard and an officers guard. Each regiment, or military unit that carries a colour, in Sweden sets up its own colour guard. The Swedish military rank of [[f\u00e4nrik]] (and the corresponding cavalry rank of ''kornet'') was originally intended for the holder of the company flag. This duty was considered so prestigious that an officer was necessary to carry it out. Today, it is a regular officer rank.\n\n====Greater colour guard====\nThis is composed of two commissioned officers, called ''fanf\u00f6rare'' (''carriers of the colour'') and eight enlisted soldiers. This stems from the time of king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]] when all Swedish regiments had eight battalions. Each battalion contributed one soldier to the common colour guard.\n\n====Small colour guard====\nThis is composed of one commissioned officer and four enlisted soldiers.\n\n====Officers guard====\nThis is composed of three commissioned officers.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[military of the United States]], the ''color guard'' (where the word ''color'' is referring to the national flag) carries the [[Colours, standards and guidons#United States|national colour]] and other [[flag]]s appropriate to its position in the [[chain of command]]. Typically these include a [[Military unit|unit]] flag and a departmental flag ([[United States Department of the Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]], [[United States Department of the Air Force|Air Force]], or [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]). In addition to the flag bearers, who are positioned in the center of the color guard, there are two or more individuals who carry [[rifle]]s and or [[sabre]]s. This is a symbol that the flag (and its nation) will always be protected.\n\n====Composition of the US color guard====\n[[File:2009 Non-commissioned Officer Parade DVIDS173390.jpg|thumb|A color guard detachment from the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in full dress.

The sergeant major is also responsible for the selection, training, and performance of the members.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (e)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref> The color guard consists of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] members and is commanded by the senior (color) [[Sergeant]], who carries the National Color and gives the necessary commands for movements and rendering honors during drill exercises or [[parade]] ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 45 (a)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref>\n\nBeing assigned to the color guard is considered an honor due to the fact that these individuals present and carry the symbols of their unit and country. Depending on the circumstance and subject to the orders of their commander, members may wear [[Dress uniform|full dress]] or less formal [[Military uniform|uniforms]]. It is mandatory for all members of the color guard to wear headgear, for example, a [[garrison cap]], [[beret]], or [[service cap]]. On occasion, certain color guards can be [[horse]]-[[Riding animal#Riding animals or mounts|mounted]].\n\nA US color guard is made up of a \"Color Sergeant\" carrying the National Colors and serves as the unit commander, a unit or command \"Color Bearer\", and two \"Color Escorts\" carrying rifles and/or sabres. If multiple colors are carried, multiple color bearers may be needed.\n\n====Manoeuvering====\nThe color guard is formed and marched in one rank at close interval (shoulder-to-shoulder). Since the National Colors must always be in the position of honor on the right,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/FM_3-21.5_Drill_and_Ceremonies.pdf |title=FM 3-21.5 (FM 22-5) Drill and Ceremonies |last1=Morrow |first1=JoyceE. |last2=Schoomaker |first2=Peter K. |date=July 2003 |website=Center of Military History |publisher=United States Army |page=K-3 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> the color guard must execute a special movement to reverse direction. It does not execute rear march, nor does it execute about face. Rather, it performs a maneuver derived from the standard countercolumn command, generally known as ''counter march'' or ''colors reverse march'', in order to keep the precedence of flags in order.\nOther drill movements performed by the color guard include [[Salute#Small arms salutes|presenting arms]], left and right wheel (turns) marches, eyes right (upon passing the reviewing stand during a parade), [[Casing of the Colors|casing/uncasing the colors]], and fixing/unfixing [[bayonet]]s (by the arms bearers).\n\n====Rendering honors====\n=====By the color guard=====\n[[File:USMC Color Guard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States Marine Corps]] color guard during the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". Note that the national flag does not dip.]]\nThe color guard renders honors when the national anthem is played or sung, when passing in review during a parade, or in certain other circumstances. In these cases, the unit and departmental flags salute by dipping (leaning the flag forward). However, with the exception of a response to a naval salute, the United States national flag renders no salute. This is enshrined in the [[United States Flag Code]] and U.S. law.\n\n=====To the color guard=====\nIn the U.S. military, individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased (unfurled) colors render honors when outdoors. Individuals who are not part of any formation begin the hand salute when the colors are six paces distant and hold it until they have passed six paces beyond the colors.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (c)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])</ref>\n\nCivilians are expected to stand at the position of attention with their right hand placed over their heart for the same period, and the hand salute applies to uniformed organizations as well (specifically the Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of America). Since recently, veterans are expected to hand salute the colors too, like their military counterparts including personnel not in uniform.\n\n== See also==\n* [[Guard of honour]]\n* [[Presentation of Colours]]\n* [[Trooping the Colour]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Colour guards}}\n*[http://www.oldguard.mdw.army.mil/specialty-platoons/continental-color-guard Continental Color Guard of The Old Guard]\n* [http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%202.aspx MCO P5060.20 US Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual] Chapter 7\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060516151759/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=3905 U.

This was enabled by changing the standard office air conditioner temperature to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C (or about 82&nbsp;\u00b0F) and introducing a liberal summer dress code in the bureaucracy of the Japanese government so staff could work in the warmer temperature. The campaign then spread to the private sector.\n\nThis idea was proposed by the then-[[Minister of the Environment (Japan)|Minister]] [[Yuriko Koike]] under the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Junichir\u014d Koizumi]]. Initially the campaign was from June to September, but from 2011, when there were electricity shortages after the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] it was lengthened. It now runs from May to October.<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20150501p2a00m0na011000c.html 'Cool Biz' casual work attire campaign kicks off May 1, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503194142/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20150501p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=May  3, 2015 }} ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' Retrieved May 4, 2015</ref>\n\n==Plan==\nAccording to the Ministry of the Environment, central government ministries were to set [[air conditioner]] temperatures at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C until September. The Cool Biz dress code advises workers to starch collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from materials that breathe and absorb moisture. Additionally, workers are encouraged to wear short-sleeved shirts without jackets or ties.  Many workers, though, were confused about whether they should follow the new stipulations\u2014many came to work with their jackets in hand and their ties in their pockets. Even those who liked the idea of dressing more casually sometimes became self-conscious during their commutes when they were surrounded by non-government employees who were all wearing standard business suits. Many government workers said they felt it was impolite not to wear a tie when meeting counterparts from the private sector.\n\nAll of the government leaders took part in Cool Biz. Prime Minister Koizumi was frequently interviewed without a tie or jacket, and this produced a significantly raised profile of the campaign.\n\n==Result of Cool Biz Campaign==\nOn October 28, 2005, the Ministry of Environment announced results of the Cool Biz campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/press/2005/1028a.html |title=Press Release_2005 [MOE&#93; |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref> The MOE conducted a web-based questionnaire survey on the Cool Biz campaign on September 30, 2005, covering some 1,200 men and women randomly extracted from an Internet panel recruited by a research company. Survey results indicate that 95.8% of respondents knew Cool Biz, and 32.7% of 562 respondents answered that their offices set the air conditioner thermostat higher than in previous years. Based on these figures, the Ministry estimated that the campaign resulted in a 460,000-ton reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission, the equivalent volume of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by about 1 million households for one month.\n\nSome companies including [[Toyota]] request their employees not to wear jackets and ties even when meeting with business partners.\n\nThe results for 2006 were even better, resulting in an estimated 1.14 million-ton reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission, equivalent to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by about 2.5 million households for one month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=7690 |script-title=ja:\u74b0\u5883\u7701 \u5831\u9053\u767a\u8868\u8cc7\u6599\u2212\u5e73\u621018\u5e7411\u670810\u65e5\u2212\u672c\u5e74\u5ea6\u306e\u300c\uff23\uff2f\uff2f\uff2c \uff22\uff29\uff3a\u300d\u306e\u6210\u679c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04|language=ja}}</ref> The Ministry also stated that it intends to continue encouraging people to set summer office temperatures at no lower than 28&nbsp;\u00b0C as well as to work to have the Cool Biz concept take permanent root in society.\n\nIn July 2009, the Cabinet Office announced results of a new questionnaire survey, which indicates that 91.8% of respondents knew about the Cool Biz campaign, and 57% of them put the campaign into practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mag.executive.itmedia.co.jp/executive/articles/0907/13/news042.html|script-title=ja:\u8077\u5834\u3067\u306e\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u30d3\u30ba\u5b9f\u65bd\u304c5\u5272\u3092\u8d85\u3059\u3000\u5185\u95a3\u5e9c|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2015-05-04|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==Economic results==\nWhile Cool Biz spread energy savings to all businesses, the necktie business suffered.

This was enabled by changing the standard office air conditioner temperature to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C (or about 82&nbsp;\u00b0F) and introducing a liberal summer dress code in the bureaucracy of the Japanese government so staff could work in the warmer temperature. The campaign then spread to the private sector.\n\nThis idea was proposed by the then-[[Minister of the Environment (Japan)|Minister]] [[Yuriko Koike]] under the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Junichir\u014d Koizumi]]. Initially the campaign was from June to September, but from 2011, when there were electricity shortages after the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] it was lengthened. It now runs from May to October.<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20150501p2a00m0na011000c.html 'Cool Biz' casual work attire campaign kicks off May 1, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503194142/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20150501p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=May  3, 2015 }} ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' Retrieved May 4, 2015</ref>\n\n==Plan==\nAccording to the Ministry of the Environment, central government ministries were to set [[air conditioner]] temperatures at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C until September. The Cool Biz dress code advises workers to starch collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from materials that breathe and absorb moisture. Additionally, workers are encouraged to wear short-sleeved shirts without jackets or ties.  Many workers, though, were confused about whether they should follow the new stipulations\u2014many came to work with their jackets in hand and their ties in their pockets. Even those who liked the idea of dressing more casually sometimes became self-conscious during their commutes when they were surrounded by non-government employees who were all wearing standard business suits. Many government workers said they felt it was impolite not to wear a tie when meeting counterparts from the private sector.\n\nAll of the government leaders took part in Cool Biz. Prime Minister Koizumi was frequently interviewed without a tie or jacket, and this produced a significantly raised profile of the campaign.\n\n==Result of Cool Biz Campaign==\nOn October 28, 2005, the Ministry of Enivronment announced results of the Cool Biz campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/press/2005/1028a.html |title=Press Release_2005 [MOE&#93; |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref> The MOE conducted a web-based questionnaire survey on the Cool Biz campaign on September 30, 2005, covering some 1,200 men and women randomly extracted from an Internet panel recruited by a research company. Survey results indicate that 95.8% of respondents knew Cool Biz, and 32.7% of 562 respondents answered that their offices set the air conditioner thermostat higher than in previous years. Based on these figures, the Ministry estimated that the campaign resulted in a 460,000-ton reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission, the equivalent volume of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by about 1 million households for one month.\n\nSome companies including [[Toyota]] request their employees not to wear jackets and ties even when meeting with business partners.\n\nThe results for 2006 were even better, resulting in an estimated 1.14 million-ton reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission, equivalent to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by about 2.5 million households for one month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=7690 |script-title=ja:\u74b0\u5883\u7701 \u5831\u9053\u767a\u8868\u8cc7\u6599\u2212\u5e73\u621018\u5e7411\u670810\u65e5\u2212\u672c\u5e74\u5ea6\u306e\u300c\uff23\uff2f\uff2f\uff2c \uff22\uff29\uff3a\u300d\u306e\u6210\u679c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04|language=ja}}</ref> The Ministry also stated that it intends to continue encouraging people to set summer office temperatures at no lower than 28&nbsp;\u00b0C as well as to work to have the Cool Biz concept take permanent root in society.\n\nIn July 2009, the Cabinet Office announced results of a new questionnaire survey, which indicates that 91.8% of respondents knew about the Cool Biz campaign, and 57% of them put the campaign into practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mag.executive.itmedia.co.jp/executive/articles/0907/13/news042.html|script-title=ja:\u8077\u5834\u3067\u306e\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u30d3\u30ba\u5b9f\u65bd\u304c5\u5272\u3092\u8d85\u3059\u3000\u5185\u95a3\u5e9c|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2015-05-04|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==Economic results==\nWhile Cool Biz spread energy savings to all businesses, the necktie business suffered.

{"title_page": "Tadeusz Katelbach", "text_new": "[[File:Tadeusz Katelbach.jpg|185px|thumb|Tadeusz Katelbach]]'''Tadeusz Katelbach''' (1897\u20131977) was a [[Poland|Polish]] politician, diplomat, journalist, publicist, senator in the [[Second Polish Republic]], and activist of [[Polish American|American]] [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn on February 24, 1897 in [[Warsaw]], which at that time belonged to Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]], Katelbach attended Gorski High School in Warsaw. In 1910, he joined secret Polish organization Association of Progressive Independent Youth (Zwiazek Mlodziezy Postepowo-Niepodleglosciowej), and in 1913, he entered the paramilitary [[Riflemen's Association]]. In August 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Katelbach joined [[Polish Military Organisation]].\n\nIn November 1915, after German Army had captured Warsaw (see [[Great Retreat (Russian)]]), Katelbach began studying law at [[Warsaw University]]. While still a member of Polish Military Organisation, he also joined [[Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\"]], and was one of leaders of a student strike in 1917.\n\nIn late 1918 and early 1919, Katelbach fought in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] in [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]]. In August 1919, together with other activists of Polish Military Organisation he organized the [[Sejny Uprising]], aimed at local [[Lithuania]]n administration. During this rebellion, Katelbach became a close associate of Second Directorate of [[Polish General Staff]] (see [[History of Polish intelligence services]]), which was responsible for [[military intelligence]] and [[counterintelligence]]. As a member of Association of [[Kresy]] Guards, he came to [[Wilno]] after [[Zeligowski's Mutiny]], and became editor in chief of the Gazeta Wilenska newspaper.\n\n== Second Polish Republic ==\nIn 1922, Katelbach was sent on a short mission to the [[Free City of Danzig]], and in January 1923, shortly after his wedding with Zenaida n\u00e9e Semplinska, he left for [[Berlin]]. Officially, Katelbach was a reporter of several Polish papers, but the real purpose of his mission was to provide a link between the government in Warsaw, and newly created [[Union of Poles in Germany]]. After a few months, Katelbach returned to Warsaw and work in a bank for over a year.\n\nIn November 1925, he was sent to [[Geneva]]. Again, Katelbach was presented as a journalist, but in fact he was a [[resident spy]]. In May 1926, shortly before the [[May Coup (Poland)]], he was recalled to Poland, and joined pro-[[Sanacja]] organization [[Union for Improvement of the Republic]]. In January 1927, Katelbach was again sent to Berlin, tasked with centralization of Polish national organizations in [[Weimar Republic]]. He remained there until August 2, 1933, when he was sent to [[Kaunas]], where Katelbach was regarded as unofficial Polish envoy to [[Lithuania]]. In 1937, after returning to Poland, he was awarded Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].\n\nIn 1937 - 38, Katelbach together with his brother Stefan became actively involved in Polish filming industry. He managed film department at [[Polish Telegraphic Agency]]. In November 1938, after joining pro-government [[Camp of National Unity]], he was elected to the [[Polish Senate]] from the District of [[Lublin]].\n\n== World War Two ==\nOn September 12, 1939, Minister of Propaganda [[Micha\u0142 Gra\u017cy\u0144ski]] ordered Katelbach to form information and press office of his ministry at [[Budapest]]. Two days later, at a local office building in [[Zalishchyky|Zaleszczyki]], Katelbach met with oppositional, anti-[[Sanacja]] politicians: [[Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski]], [[Henryk Strasburger]], [[Aleksander \u0141ado\u015b]], [[August Zaleski]] and [[Tadeusz Tomaszewski]]. A few months later, all became involved in [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]'s Government in Exile, located in [[France]].\n\nKatelbach left Poland on September 14, and while in [[Romania]], he immediately became involved in the activities of a political group associated with Ambassador [[Roger Raczy\u0144ski]], [[Alfred Poninski]] and Polish military attache to Romania, Colonel [[Tadeusz Zakrzewski]]. It was partly due to their activities that members of legal Polish government, together with Prime Minister [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] were interned by the Romanians in the town of [[Slanic]]. On September 21, Katelbach sent a letter to Skladkowski, urging him to resign from the post, and on the next day he left Romania, to reach [[Paris]] on October 6, 1939.\n\nEnjoying the support of Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski, who was deputy Prime Minister of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski's [[Polish government-in-exile|government-in-exile]], Katelbach was offered a job at the Ministry of Information and Documentation. After the [[Fall of France]], on June 23, 1940 he left for [[Portugal]], via [[Spain]], and joined the Committee of Aid for Polish Refugees in [[Lisbon]]. On July 14, 1940 he came to [[London]], and was immediately named chairman of German Department at the Office of Documentation (part of Stanislaw Stronski Ministry of Information). Katelbach remained in this post since July 1941 until July 1945, when Great Britain ceased to recognize Polish government in Exile.\n\n== Postwar Period and Death ==\n[[File:Tadeusz Katelbach gr\u00f3b.JPG|thumb|240px|Grave of Tadeusz Katelbach in catacombs section of the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery, Warsaw]]\nAfter the war, Katelbach decided to stay in London, where he lived until 1955, as an active member of Polish emigree circles. In June 1955 he left for [[Munich]], where [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]] offered him a job at Polish Section of [[Radio Free Europe]]. Recommended by [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] and [[Tadeusz Bielecki]], Katelbach remained a full-time employee of the radio until his retirement in July 1965.\n\nIn December 1965, together with wife, Katelbach left Munich and went to [[Seattle]], where their daughter [[Nina Polan]] lived. In May 1966, they moved to [[New York City]].\n\nSuffering from diabetes, Tadeusz Katelbach died from [[myocardial infarction]] on November 9, 1977 in New York City, while awaiting heart surgery. He was buried alongside his wife, Zenaida, and their daughter, in catacombs section of the [[Pow\u0105zki Cemetery|Pow\u0105zki Cemetery in Warsaw]].\n\n== The Year of Bad Prophecies ==\nTadeusz Katelbach wrote several books, including his 1943 London diary \"The Year of Bad Prophecies\" (\"Rok zlych wrozb\"). In the book, he presents a vivid portrait of members of Polish Government in Exile, and criticizes Prime Minister [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] for his decisions. Katelbach writes: \"The year 1943 brought us bad events. Political leadership of the Polish Government in London was unable to cope with the difficult tasks. The westward march of the Soviet armies, flooding Polish lands, was a forecast of complete subjugation of Poland. The stance of Moscow leaves no illusions (...) After the disastrous [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement]] of 1941, Sikorski caused the dissolution of the [[National Council of Poland]], so that there is no discussion of the agreement (...) The Allies are making it obvious that they are leaving us alone with Moscow. And Moscow has already decided the question of our Eastern borders.

In 1910, he joined secret Polish organization Association of Progressive Independent Youth (Zwiazek Mlodziezy Postepowo-Niepodleglosciowej), and in 1913, he entered the paramilitary [[Riflemen's Association]]. In August 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Katelbach joined [[Polish Military Organisation]].\n\nIn November 1915, after German Army had captured Warsaw (see [[Great Retreat (Russian)]]), Katelbach began studying law at [[Warsaw University]]. While still a member of Polish Military Organisation, he also joined [[Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\"]], and was one of leaders of a student strike in 1917.\n\nIn late 1918 and early 1919, Katelbach fought in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] in [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]]. In August 1919, together with other activists of Polish Military Organisation he organized the [[Sejny Uprising]], aimed at local [[Lithuania]]n administration. During this rebellion, Katelbach became a close associate of Second Directorate of [[Polish General Staff]] (see [[History of Polish intelligence services]]), which was responsible for [[military intelligence]] and [[counterintelligence]]. As a member of Association of [[Kresy]] Guards, he came to [[Wilno]] after [[Zeligowski's Mutiny]], and became editor in chief of the Gazeta Wilenska newspaper.\n\n== Second Polish Republic ==\nIn 1922, Katelbach was sent on a short mission to the [[Free City of Danzig]], and in January 1923, shortly after his wedding with Zenaida n\u00e9e Semplinska, he left for [[Berlin]]. Officially, Katelbach was a reporter of several Polish papers, but the real purpose of his mission was to provide a link between the government in Warsaw, and newly created [[Union of Poles in Germany]]. After a few months, Katelbach returned to Warsaw and work in a bank for over a year.\n\nIn November 1925, he was sent to [[Geneva]]. Again, Katelbach was presented as a journalist, but in fact he was a [[resident spy]]. In May 1926, shortly before the [[May Coup (Poland)]], he was recalled to Poland, and joined pro-[[Sanacja]] organization [[Union for Improvement of the Republic]]. In January 1927, Katelbach was again sent to Berlin, tasked with centralization of Polish national organizations in [[Weimar Republic]]. He remained there until August 2, 1933, when he was sent to [[Kaunas]], where Katelbach was regarded as unofficial Polish envoy to [[Lithuania]]. In 1937, after returning to Poland, he was awarded Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].\n\nIn 1937 - 38, Katelbach together with his brother Stefan became actively involved in Polish filming industry. He managed film department at [[Polish Telegraphic Agency]]. In November 1938, after joining pro-government [[Camp of National Unity]], he was elected to the [[Polish Senate]] from the District of [[Lublin]].\n\n== World War Two ==\nOn September 12, 1939, Minister of Propaganda [[Micha\u0142 Gra\u017cy\u0144ski]] ordered Katelbach to form information and press office of his ministry at [[Budapest]]. Two days later, at a local office building in [[Zalishchyky|Zaleszczyki]], Katelbach met with oppositional, anti-[[Sanacja]] politicians: [[Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski]], [[Henryk Strasburger]], [[Aleksander \u0141ado\u015b]], [[August Zaleski]] and [[Tadeusz Tomaszewski]]. A few months later, all became involved in [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]'s Government in Exile, located in [[France]].\n\nKatelbach left Poland on September 14, and while in [[Romania]], he immediately became involved in the activities of a political group associated with Ambassador [[Roger Raczy\u0144ski]], [[Alfred Poninski]] and Polish military attache to Romania, Colonel [[Tadeusz Zakrzewski]]. It was partly due to their activities that members of legal Polish government, together with Prime Minister [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] were interned by the Romanians in the town of [[Slanic]]. On September 21, Katelbach sent a letter to Skladkowski, urging him to resign from the post, and on the next day he left Romania, to reach [[Paris]] on October 6, 1939.\n\nEnjoing the support of Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski, who was deputy Prime Minister of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski's [[Polish government-in-exile|government-in-exile]], Katelbach was offered a job at the Ministry of Information and Documentation. After the [[Fall of France]], on June 23, 1940 he left for [[Portugal]], via [[Spain]], and joined the Committee of Aid for Polish Refugees in [[Lisbon]]. On July 14, 1940 he came to [[London]], and was immediately named chairman of German Department at the Office of Documentation (part of Stanislaw Stronski Ministry of Information). Katelbach remained in this post since July 1941 until July 1945, when Great Britain ceased to recognize Polish government in Exile.\n\n== Postwar Period and Death ==\n[[File:Tadeusz Katelbach gr\u00f3b.JPG|thumb|240px|Grave of Tadeusz Katelbach in catacombs section of the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery, Warsaw]]\nAfter the war, Katelbach decided to stay in London, where he lived until 1955, as an active member of Polish emigree circles. In June 1955 he left for [[Munich]], where [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]] offered him a job at Polish Section of [[Radio Free Europe]]. Recommended by [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] and [[Tadeusz Bielecki]], Katelbach remained a full-time employee of the radio until his retirement in July 1965.\n\nIn December 1965, together with wife, Katelbach left Munich and went to [[Seattle]], where their daughter [[Nina Polan]] lived. In May 1966, they moved to [[New York City]].\n\nSuffering from diabetes, Tadeusz Katelbach died from [[myocardial infarction]] on November 9, 1977 in New York City, while awaiting heart surgery. He was buried alongside his wife, Zenaida, and their daughter, in catacombs section of the [[Pow\u0105zki Cemetery|Pow\u0105zki Cemetery in Warsaw]].\n\n== The Year of Bad Prophecies ==\nTadeusz Katelbach wrote several books, including his 1943 London diary \"The Year of Bad Prophecies\" (\"Rok zlych wrozb\"). In the book, he presents a vivid portrait of members of Polish Government in Exile, and criticizes Prime Minister [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] for his decisions. Katelbach writes: \"The year 1943 brought us bad events. Political leadership of the Polish Government in London was unable to cope with the difficult tasks. The westward march of the Soviet armies, flooding Polish lands, was a forecast of complete subjugation of Poland. The stance of Moscow leaves no illusions (...) After the disastrous [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement]] of 1941, Sikorski caused the dissolution of the [[National Council of Poland]], so that there is no discussion of the agreement (...) The Allies are making it obvious that they are leaving us alone with Moscow. And Moscow has already decided the question of our Eastern borders. The realists know it, even though Stalin for propaganda reasons assures that Russia does not plan to seize non-Russian lands (...) The Soviets spend 200 000 pounds monthly for their propaganda, which is visible everywhere in England.

Thirteen state and [[Territories of the United States|territorial]] [[Governor#United States|governorships]], as well as numerous other state and local elections, will also be contested.\n\nEach [[major party]] will choose a nominee for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] through a series of primaries and caucuses, culminating in a national convention held in mid-2020. Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[Donald Trump]] is seeking re-nomination in the [[2020 Republican Party presidential primaries]], while Joe Biden is the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s presumptive nominee after his sweeping wins in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].\n\nBarring vacancies and party-switching, Republicans will enter the 2020 elections with control of 53 of the 100 seats in the Senate, while Democrats will enter the election with control of approximately 235 seats in the House of Representatives.{{efn|The exact number of Democratic seats will depend on the results of vacancies and special elections that occur prior to November 2020.}} All 33 [[Classes of United States senators|Class 2]] senators are up for election, and two states (Georgia and Arizona) are holding special elections for the Senate. The six [[Delegate (United States Congress)|non-voting congressional delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and the inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]] will also be elected.\n\nThe vast majority of the fifty states will hold regularly-scheduled state legislative elections, and eleven states will hold gubernatorial elections.

Like the Republican primaries, the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2020|2020 Democratic primaries]] will take place from early 2020 to mid-2020. The Democratic ticket will be nominated at the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]], held in July 2020. Other parties will conduct various processes to choose their presidential tickets, and [[independent politician|independent]] candidates may also seek the presidency.\n\nThe individual who wins a majority of the presidential [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]] (270 of the 538 electoral votes) will win the presidential election. The current electoral vote distribution was determined by the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Each elector is chosen by the states and is charged with casting one vote for president and one vote for vice president. Most states award all their electoral votes to the individual who wins a majority or plurality of that state's popular vote, although two states award electors by [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]]. If no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote, then the [[United States House of Representatives]] will hold a [[contingent election]] to determine the winner.{{efn|In a contingent election, the House of Representatives can choose from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. Each state delegation of the House of Representatives receives one vote. For example, the state delegation of Alabama (consisting of seven representatives) and the state delegation of Alaska (consisting of one representative) each collectively receive one vote.}} The vice president is selected in a similar manner, though a contingent election will be held in the [[United States Senate]] if no individual receives a majority of the vice presidential electoral vote.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Congressional elections===\n====Senate elections====\n{{main|2020 United States Senate elections}}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:33%\" | 33\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:12%\" | 12\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}; width:2%\" | 2\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:22%\" | 23\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:31%\" | 30\n\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n| style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:33%\" | 33 Democrats<br/>not up\n| style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:12%\" | 12 Democrats<br/>up\n| style=\"color:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}; width:2%\" | {{efn | 2 Independents not up}}\n| style=\"color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:23%\" | 23 Republicans<br/>up\n| style=\"color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:30%\" | 30 Republicans<br/>not up\n\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Control of Senate seats by class after the 2018 elections\n|-\n!
