Improper disposal of petroleum products such as [[gasoline]] and [[mineral spirits]] contribute to sewer gas hazards.  Sewer gases are of concern due to their odor, health effects, and potential for creating fire or explosions.\n\n==In homes==\nSewer gas is typically restricted from entering buildings through [[trap (plumbing)|plumbing traps]] that create a [[water seal (plumbing)|water seal]] at potential points of entry.  In addition, plumbing [[Plumbing drainage venting|vents]] allow sewer gases to be exhausted outdoors.  Infrequently used [[plumbing fixture]]s may allow sewer gas to enter a home due to [[evaporation]] of water in the trap, especially in warm weather.  The result is the most common means of sewer gas entering buildings and can be solved easily by using the fixtures regularly or adding water to their drains. One of the most common traps to dry out are floor drains such as those typically placed near home [[furnace]]s,  [[water heating|water heaters]] and rooms with underfloor heating. Infrequently used utility sinks, tubs, showers, and restrooms also are common culprits.  [[Trap primer]]s are available that automatically add water to remote or little used traps such as these. Blocked plumbing vents, typically at the roof, also can cause water seals to fail via siphoning of the water.\n\nExposure to sewer gas also can happen if the gas seeps in via a leaking plumbing drain or vent pipe, or even through cracks in a building\u2019s foundation. Sewer gas is typically denser than atmospheric gases and may accumulate in basements, but may eventually mix with surrounding air. Individuals who work in sanitation industries or on farms might be exposed on the job if they clean or maintain municipal [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[manure]] storage tanks, or [[septic tank]]s.\n\nIn buildings with [[HVAC]] [[Air handling unit|air handlers]] that admit outside air for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows can be a source of sewer gas odors.   In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to sewer gas odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes.  Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Wasp 1882-01-13 cover The Dance of Death.jpg|thumb|The cover of an 1882 issue of ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]'', with an illustration linking sewer gas and disease]]\nDuring the mid-1800s, when indoor plumbing was being developed, it was a common idea that disease was caused largely by [[Miasma theory|miasmas]], or literally \"polluted air.\"<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1275984 | pmid=11733443 | volume=175 | issue=6 | title=&quot;The insidious foe&quot;--sewer gas |date=December 2001 | journal=West.

Originally, traps in plumbing drain pipes were designed to help keep this bad air from passing back into living spaces within buildings.  However, during the [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in London, in the Summer of 1854, physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], among others, worked to prove that polluted water was the culprit, not the foul smells from sewage pipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theghostmap.com/|title=The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson - Online Resources|website=www.theghostmap.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Johnson  | first = Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author)  | title = [[The Ghost Map]] | publisher = [[Riverhead Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59448-925-4 }}</ref> Subsequently, even as the [[germ theory of disease]] developed, society was slow to accept the idea that odors from sewers were relatively harmless when it came to the spread of disease.\n\n==Health effects==\nIn most homes, sewer gas may have a slightly unpleasant odor, but does not often pose a significant health hazard.<ref>{{cite web |author=Thad Godish |title=Indoor Environment Notebook |publisher=Ball State University: Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management |url=http://publish.bsu.edu/ien/archives/2002/022802.htm |date=February 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113002423/http://publish.bsu.edu/ien/archives/2002/022802.htm |archivedate=2012-01-13}}</ref>  Residential sewer pipes primarily contain the gases found in [[air]] ([[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], etc.).<ref>VK Ojha, P Dutta,Intelligent Gas Recognition System: Analysis and Design Issue,Lambert Academic Publishing, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, {{ISBN|978-3-659-21734-0}}</ref>  Often, [[methane]] is the gas of next highest concentration, but typically remains at nontoxic levels, especially in properly vented systems. However, if sewer gas has a distinct \u201crotten egg\u201d smell, especially in sewage mains, septic tanks, or other sewage treatment facilities, it may be due to [[hydrogen sulfide]] content, which can be detected by human olfactory senses in concentrations as low as [[parts per billion]]. Exposure to low levels of this [[chemical]] can irritate the eyes, cause a cough or sore throat, [[hypoxia (medical)|shortness of breath]], and fluid accumulation in the [[lung]]s. Prolonged low-level exposure may cause fatigue, pneumonia, loss of appetite, [[headaches]], irritability, poor memory, and dizziness. High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (>150 ppm) can produce [[olfactory fatigue]], whereby the scent becomes undetectable.  At higher concentrations (>300 ppm), hydrogen sulfide can cause loss of consciousness and death. Very high concentrations (>1000 ppm) can result in immediate collapse, occurring after a single breath.\n\n==Explosion risk==\nSewer gas can contain methane and hydrogen sulfide, both highly flammable and potentially explosive substances. As such, ignition of the gas is possible with flame or sparks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/air/sewergas.htm|website=www.dhs.wisconsin.gov|date=3 March 2017|title=Exposure to sewer gas|}}</ref>\nThe methane concentration in open sewers is lower (7 to 15 ppmv) than the closed drains (up to 300 ppmv) in samples collected 2 cm above the level of sewage.<ref> N N Purkait and D K Chakrabarty.

Septic vent pipes can be fitted with filters that remove some odors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nSewer gas can be used as a power source, thus reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The gas is piped into a cleaning system and then used as a fuel to power a generator or combined heat and power (CHP) plant.\n\n==Impact on sewerage==\n\nGases present in sewerage can strongly impact material\ndurability due to the action of microorganisms.

Improper disposal of petroleum products such as [[gasoline]] and [[mineral spirits]] contribute to sewer gas hazards.  Sewer gases are of concern due to their odor, health effects, and potential for creating fire or explosions.\n\n==In homes==\nSewer gas is typically restricted from entering buildings through [[trap (plumbing)|plumbing traps]] that create a [[water seal (plumbing)|water seal]] at potential points of entry.  In addition, plumbing [[Plumbing drainage venting|vents]] allow sewer gases to be exhausted outdoors.  Infrequently used [[plumbing fixture]]s may allow sewer gas to enter a home due to [[evaporation]] of water in the trap, especially in warm weather.  The result is the most common means of sewer gas entering buildings and can be solved easily by using the fixtures regularly or adding water to their drains. One of the most common traps to dry out are floor drains such as those typically placed near home [[furnace]]s,  [[water heater]]s and rooms with underfloor heating. Infrequently used utility sinks, tubs, showers, and restrooms also are common culprits.  [[Trap primer]]s are available that automatically add water to remote or little used traps such as these. Blocked plumbing vents, typically at the roof, also can cause water seals to fail via siphoning of the water.\n\nExposure to sewer gas also can happen if the gas seeps in via a leaking plumbing drain or vent pipe, or even through cracks in a building\u2019s foundation. Sewer gas is typically denser than atmospheric gases and may accumulate in basements, but may eventually mix with surrounding air. Individuals who work in sanitation industries or on farms might be exposed on the job if they clean or maintain municipal [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[manure]] storage tanks, or [[septic tank]]s.\n\nIn buildings with [[HVAC]] [[Air handling unit|air handlers]] that admit outside air for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows can be a source of sewer gas odors.   In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to sewer gas odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes.  Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Wasp 1882-01-13 cover The Dance of Death.jpg|thumb|The cover of an 1882 issue of ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]'', with an illustration linking sewer gas and disease]]\nDuring the mid-1800s, when indoor plumbing was being developed, it was a common idea that disease was caused largely by [[Miasma theory|miasmas]], or literally \"polluted air.\"<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1275984 | pmid=11733443 | volume=175 | issue=6 | title=&quot;The insidious foe&quot;--sewer gas |date=December 2001 | journal=West.

Originally, traps in plumbing drain pipes were designed to help keep this bad air from passing back into living spaces within buildings.  However, during the [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in London, in the Summer of 1854, physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], among others, worked to prove that polluted water was the culprit, not the foul smells from sewage pipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theghostmap.com/|title=The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson - Online Resources|website=www.theghostmap.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Johnson  | first = Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author)  | title = [[The Ghost Map]] | publisher = [[Riverhead Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59448-925-4 }}</ref> Subsequently, even as the [[germ theory of disease]] developed, society was slow to accept the idea that odors from sewers were relatively harmless when it came to the spread of disease.\n\n==Health effects==\nIn most homes, sewer gas may have a slightly unpleasant odor, but does not often pose a significant health hazard.<ref>{{cite web |author=Thad Godish |title=Indoor Environment Notebook |publisher=Ball State University: Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management |url=http://publish.bsu.edu/ien/archives/2002/022802.htm |date=February 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113002423/http://publish.bsu.edu/ien/archives/2002/022802.htm |archivedate=2012-01-13}}</ref>  Residential sewer pipes primarily contain the gases found in [[air]] ([[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], etc.).<ref>VK Ojha, P Dutta,Intelligent Gas Recognition System: Analysis and Design Issue,Lambert Academic Publishing, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, {{ISBN|978-3-659-21734-0}}</ref>  Often, [[methane]] is the gas of next highest concentration, but typically remains at nontoxic levels, especially in properly vented systems. However, if sewer gas has a distinct \u201crotten egg\u201d smell, especially in sewage mains, septic tanks, or other sewage treatment facilities, it may be due to [[hydrogen sulfide]] content, which can be detected by human olfactory senses in concentrations as low as [[parts per billion]]. Exposure to low levels of this [[chemical]] can irritate the eyes, cause a cough or sore throat, [[hypoxia (medical)|shortness of breath]], and fluid accumulation in the [[lung]]s. Prolonged low-level exposure may cause fatigue, pneumonia, loss of appetite, [[headaches]], irritability, poor memory, and dizziness. High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (>150 ppm) can produce [[olfactory fatigue]], whereby the scent becomes undetectable.  At higher concentrations (>300 ppm), hydrogen sulfide can cause loss of consciousness and death. Very high concentrations (>1000 ppm) can result in immediate collapse, occurring after a single breath.\n\n==Explosion risk==\nSewer gas can contain methane and hydrogen sulfide, both highly flammable and potentially explosive substances. As such, ignition of the gas is possible with flame or sparks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/air/sewergas.htm|website=www.dhs.wisconsin.gov|date=3 March 2017|title=Exposure to sewer gas|}}</ref>\nThe methane concentration in open sewers is lower (7 to 15 ppmv) than the closed drains (up to 300 ppmv) in samples collected 2 cm above the level of sewage.<ref> N N Purkait and D K Chakrabarty.

Septic vent pipes can be fitted with filters that remove some odors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nSewer gas can be used as a power source, thus reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The gas is piped into a cleaning system and then used as a fuel to power a generator or combined heat and power (CHP) plant.\n\n==Impact on sewerage==\n\nGases present in sewerage can strongly impact material\ndurability due to the action of microorganisms. The most deleterious one is associated to hydrogen sulfide that can result in [[biogenic sulfide corrosion]] or [[microbial corrosion]].

The screenplay and the story were written by [[Katherine Fugate]], Abby Kohn, and Marc Silverstein. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Carter Jenkins]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Taylor Lautner]], [[George Lopez]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Julia Roberts]], Bryce Robinson and [[Taylor Swift]] in her film debut. The film received negative reviews but was a major box office success.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows a group of related characters and their struggles with love on [[Valentine's Day]].\n\nFlorist Reed Bennett ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) wakes up and proposes to his girlfriend Morley Clarkson ([[Jessica Alba]]), who accepts. However, Reed's closest friends, Alfonso Rodriguez ([[George Lopez]]) and Julia Fitzpatrick ([[Jennifer Garner]]), aren't surprised when Morley suddenly changes her mind and leaves Reed a few hours later.\n\nOn a flight to [[Los Angeles]], Kate Hazeltine ([[Julia Roberts]]), a captain in the [[U.S. Army]] on a one-day leave, befriends Holden Wilson ([[Bradley Cooper]]). Kate is travelling a long distance to get back home only for a short time, and Holden states that she must really be in love to do so. When the plane lands and Kate has to wait hours for the taxi, Holden offers his limousine to allow her to be there on time.\n\nJulia, an elementary school teacher, has fallen in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), but does not know that he is married to Pamela ([[Katherine LaNasa]]). Harrison tells her that he needs to go to [[San Francisco]] for a business trip: on his way, he stops by at Reed's flowershop and orders two flower bouquets - asking for discretion. Wanting to surprise him and despite Reed's warnings, Julia flies to San Francisco, convinced that Reed was wrong. Julia finds out that he is married and finds him at a local restaurant. Dressed as a waitress, Julia makes a scene at the restaurant, making Pamela suspicious.\n\nOne of Julia's students, Edison (Bryce Robinson), orders flowers from Reed, to be sent to his teacher. Julia suggests to Edison to give the flowers to a girl named Rani in his class who has a crush on him after telling Edison the meaning of love.\n\nEdison's babysitter Grace Smart ([[Emma Roberts]]) is planning to lose her virginity to her boyfriend Alex Franklin ([[Carter Jenkins]]). The planned encounter goes awry when Grace's mother discovers a naked Alex in Grace's room, rehearsing a song he wrote for Grace.\n\nEdison's grandparents, Edgar ([[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]]) and Estelle Paddington ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) are facing the troubles of a long marriage. Estelle admits to Edgar about an affair she had with one of his business partners long ago. Although she is deeply sorry, Edgar is very upset.\n\nGrace's high school friends, Willy Harrington ([[Taylor Lautner]]) and Felicia Miller ([[Taylor Swift]]), are experiencing the freshness of new love, and have agreed to wait to have sex.\n\nSean Jackson ([[Eric Dane]]), a [[closeted]] [[gay]] professional football player, is contemplating the end of his career with his publicist Kara Monahan ([[Jessica Biel]]) and his agent Paula Thomas ([[Queen Latifah]]). Kara is organizing her annual \"I Hate Valentine's Day\" party, but soon becomes interested in sports reporter Kelvin Moore ([[Jamie Foxx]]), who was ordered to do a Valentine's Day report by his boss Susan Moralez ([[Kathy Bates]]), and who shares Kara's hatred of the holiday.\n\nSubstituting for Paula's absent secretary is one of the firm's receptionists, Liz Curran ([[Anne Hathaway]]), who dates mail-room clerk Jason Morris ([[Topher Grace]]). Jason is shocked when Liz turns out to be moonlighting as a [[phone sex]] operator. Liz explains that she is only doing this because she has a $100,000 student loan to pay off. Jason is upset, but eventually reconciles with her after seeing Edgar forgive Estelle.\n\nSean finally [[coming out|comes out]] on national television, and Holden, Sean's lover, goes back to him.\nKate arrives home late at night to greet not her supposed boyfriend but her son Edison.\nWilly drops Felicia off at home after a date and they kiss. Kelvin and Kara hang out at Kelvin's news station where they later kiss. Alfonso dines with his wife, and Grace and Alex agree to wait to have sex. Edgar and Estelle reconcile and redo their marriage vows, Harrison's wife has left him because of his infidelity and Morley tries to call Reed, who is instead starting a new relationship with Julia. Paula receives a call from one of Liz's [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] clients and takes delight in expressing her dominance and sadism.\n\n==Cast==\n{{small|In alphabetical order:}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Morley Clarkson\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Susan Moralez\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Kara Monahan\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Holden Wilson\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Sean Jackson\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Dr. Harrison Copeland\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edgar Paddington\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Kelvin Moore\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Julia Fitzpatrick\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Jason Morris\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Elizabeth Curran\n* [[Carter Jenkins]] as Alexander Franklin\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Reed Bennett\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Paula Thomas\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as William Harrington\n* [[George Lopez]] as Alfonso Rodriguez\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Estelle Paddington\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Grace Smart\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Cpt.

The screenplay and the story were written by [[Katherine Fugate]], Abby Kohn, and Marc Silverstein. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Carter Jenkins]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Taylor Lautner]], [[George Lopez]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Julia Roberts]], Bryce Robinson and [[Taylor Swift]] in her film debut. The film received negative reviews but was a major box office success.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows a group of related characters and their struggles with love on [[Valentine's Day]].\n\nFlorist Reed Bennett ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) wakes up and proposes to his girlfriend Morley Clarkson ([[Jessica Alba]]), who accepts. However, Reed\u2019s closest friends, Alfonso Rodriguez ([[George Lopez]]) and Julia Fitzpatrick ([[Jennifer Garner]]), aren't surprised when Morley suddenly changes her mind and leaves Reed a few hours later.\n\nOn a flight to [[Los Angeles]], Kate Hazeltine ([[Julia Roberts]]), a captain in the [[U.S. Army]] on a one-day leave, befriends Holden Wilson ([[Bradley Cooper]]). Kate is travelling a long distance to get back home only for a short time, and Holden states that she must really be in love to do so. When the plane lands and Kate has to wait hours for the taxi, Holden offers his limousine to allow her to be there on time.\n\nJulia, an elementary school teacher, has fallen in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), but does not know that he is married to Pamela ([[Katherine LaNasa]]). Harrison tells her that he needs to go to [[San Francisco]] for a business trip: on his way, he stops by at Reed's flowershop and orders two flower bouquets - asking for discretion. Wanting to surprise him and despite Reed's warnings, Julia flies to San Francisco, convinced that Reed was wrong. Julia finds out that he is married and finds him at a local restaurant. Dressed as a waitress, Julia makes a scene at the restaurant, making Pamela suspicious.\n\nOne of Julia\u2019s students, Edison (Bryce Robinson), orders flowers from Reed, to be sent to his teacher. Julia suggests to Edison to give the flowers to a girl named Rani in his class who has a crush on him after telling Edison the meaning of love.\n\nEdison's babysitter Grace Smart ([[Emma Roberts]]) is planning to lose her virginity to her boyfriend Alex Franklin ([[Carter Jenkins]]). The planned encounter goes awry when Grace's mother discovers a naked Alex in Grace's room, rehearsing a song he wrote for Grace.\n\nEdison\u2019s grandparents, Edgar ([[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]]) and Estelle Paddington ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) are facing the troubles of a long marriage. Estelle admits to Edgar about an affair she had with one of his business partners long ago. Although she is deeply sorry, Edgar is very upset.\n\nGrace\u2019s high school friends, Willy Harrington ([[Taylor Lautner]]) and Felicia Miller ([[Taylor Swift]]), are experiencing the freshness of new love, and have agreed to wait to have sex.\n\nSean Jackson ([[Eric Dane]]), a [[closeted]] [[gay]] professional football player, is contemplating the end of his career with his publicist Kara Monahan ([[Jessica Biel]]) and his agent Paula Thomas ([[Queen Latifah]]). Kara is organizing her annual \"I Hate Valentine's Day\" party, but soon becomes interested in sports reporter Kelvin Moore ([[Jamie Foxx]]), who was ordered to do a Valentine's Day report by his boss Susan Moralez ([[Kathy Bates]]), and who shares Kara's hatred of the holiday.\n\nSubstituting for Paula's absent secretary is one of the firm's receptionists, Liz Curran ([[Anne Hathaway]]), who dates mail-room clerk Jason Morris ([[Topher Grace]]). Jason is shocked when Liz turns out to be moonlighting as a [[phone sex]] operator. Liz explains that she is only doing this because she has a $100,000 student loan to pay off. Jason is upset, but eventually reconciles with her after seeing Edgar forgive Estelle.\n\nSean finally [[coming out|comes out]] on national television, and Holden, Sean's lover, goes back to him.\nKate arrives home late at night to greet not her supposed boyfriend but her son Edison.\nWilly drops Felicia off at home after a date and they kiss. Kelvin and Kara hang out at Kelvin's news station where they later kiss. Alfonso dines with his wife, and Grace and Alex agree to wait to have sex. Edgar and Estelle reconcile and redo their marriage vows, Harrison's wife has left him because of his infidelity and Morley tries to call Reed, who is instead starting a new relationship with Julia. Paula receives a call from one of Liz's [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] clients and takes delight in expressing her dominance and sadism.\n\n==Cast==\n{{small|In alphabetical order:}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Morley Clarkson\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Susan Moralez\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Kara Monahan\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Holden Wilson\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Sean Jackson\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Dr. Harrison Copeland\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edgar Paddington\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Kelvin Moore\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Julia Fitzpatrick\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Jason Morris\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Elizabeth Curran\n* [[Carter Jenkins]] as Alexander Franklin\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Reed Bennett\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Paula Thomas\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as William Harrington\n* [[George Lopez]] as Alfonso Rodriguez\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Estelle Paddington\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Grace Smart\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Cpt.

The service drop is made up of two 120 V lines and a [[Ground and neutral|neutral line]]. When these lines are insulated and twisted together, they are referred to as a triplex cable which may contain a supporting [[Overhead_line#Construction|messenger cable]] in the middle of the neutral conductor to provide strength for long spans. The neutral line from the pole is connected to a [[ground (electrical)|ground]] near the service panel; often a conductive rod driven into the earth. The service drop provides the building with two 120 V lines of opposite [[phase (waves)|phase]], so 240 V can be obtained by connecting a load between the two 120 V conductors, while 120 V loads are connected between either of the two 120 V lines and the neutral line. 240 V circuits are used for high-demand devices, such as [[air conditioners]], [[water heating|water heaters]], [[clothes dryer]]s, [[oven]]s and [[boiler]]s, while 120 V circuits are used for lighter loads such as lighting and ordinary small appliance outlets.\n\n===European===\nIn many European countries and other countries that use European systems, [[three-phase]] service drops are often used for domestic residences. The use of three-phase power allows longer service drops to serve multiple residences, which is economical with the higher density of housing in Europe. The service drop consists of three phase wires and a neutral wire which is grounded.  Each phase wire provides around 230 V to loads connected between it and the neutral. Each of the phase wires carries 50 Hz alternating current which is 120\u00b0 out of phase with the other two.  Several slightly different voltage standards have been used in the past as well:  220Y380, 230Y400 and 240Y415, with plans for future \"harmonization\" towards 230Y400. In this notation, the first number is the voltage between a phase wire and neutral, and the second number, after the \"Y\", is the line voltage (between any two-phase wires).\n\nOther countries, such as the UK and Republic of Ireland, generally provide a single phase and neutral per house, with every third house on the same phase. In this case the available current is higher. Single-phase supplies with a supplier's fuse of up to 100 A are common, while the 3-phase domestic supplies are generally of lower current rating (often less than 50 A) per phase.\n\n==Commercial and industrial==\nCommercial and industrial service drops can be much bigger, and are usually [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]].  In the US, common services are 120Y/208 (three 120 V circuits 120 degrees out of phase, with 208\u00a0V line-to-line), 240 V three-phase, and 480 V three-phase. 600 V three-phase is common in Canada, and 380-415 V or 690 V three-phase is found in European and many other countries. Generally, higher voltages are used for heavy industrial loads, and lower voltages for commercial applications.\n\nIn North America where single-phase distribution transformers for service drops are the norm, three-phase service drops are often constructed using three single-phase transformers, wired in a Y configuration. This is called a ''transformer bank''.\n\n==Underground==\nService conductors for a customer may be run underground, from a [[padmount transformer]] to a customer's meter. \n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Service Drop}}\n[[Category:Electric power systems components]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n[[File:Service drop.jpg|A [[three phase]] 220Y400 volt service drop in China. |thumb]]\n\nIn [[electric power distribution]], a '''service drop''' is an overhead electrical line running from a [[utility pole]],  to a customer's building or other premises.

(Tiny Ones Transport Service)''''' is an American computer-animated television series.<ref name=\"greenlight\" /> Created by Travis Braun, it is a production of [[Titmouse, Inc.|Titmouse, Inc]]. The show debuted on [[Disney Junior]] on June 14, 2019.<ref name=\"VoiceCast\" />\nIt focuses on Pip the [[penguin]] and Freddy the [[flamingo]] who tend the babies during their lives at a daycare-like transporting service nursery for infants.\n\n== Plot ==\nPip the [[penguin]] and Freddy the [[flamingo]] are two delivery birds in-training at the T.O.T.S. (Tiny Ones Transport Service) who are also the non-stork delivery birds at the corporation in the future which has been burned to the ground. Together, the two help take care of the babies, where they travel around the globe to find their forever families in need while learning to solve problems under the guidance of K.C the Koala and Captain Beakman, along with the other delivery storks.  \n\nAnimation Production by Icon Creative Studio, Inc. Technicolor Animation\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* Pip the Penguin (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]]<ref name=\"VoiceCast\"/>) \u2013 A young delivery bird who serves as Freddy's navigator and is the main protagonist of the series, along with Freddy. First mentioned in episode \"Back to Cool\", his birthplace is Iceberg Alley, home of Penn and his parents, and other penguins.\n* Freddy the Flamingo (voiced by Christian J. Simon<ref name=\"VoiceCast\"/>) \u2013 A young delivery bird who is Pip's partner, and the one who does the flying. He's also the main protagonist, along with Pip. He has long wings that help him fly.\n* Captain Beakman (voiced by [[Vanessa Williams]]<ref name=\"VoiceCast\"/>) \u2013 The leader of T.O.T.S. and the mother of Mia the kitten. \n* K.C the Koala (voiced by [[Megan Hilty]]<ref name=\"VoiceCast\"/>) \u2013 A 16-year-old worker at T.O.T.S. who tends the infants before they get delivered. She runs the nursery. She is also a guitarist.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Bodhi (voiced by [[Parvesh Cheena]]) \u2013 An insecure stork deliverer with the biggest wings at T.O.T.S. He tends to get spooked by mostly ordinary things, but is willing to help when assistance is needed.\n* Ava (voiced by Melanie Minichino) \u2013 A street-talking female stork deliverer at T.O.T.S. Her catchphrase is \"Rock On!\".\n* J.P. (voiced by [[Henri Lubatti]]) \u2013 A narcistic and proud stork deliverer at T.O.T.S. who speaks in a [[French accent]]. He is one of the finest deliverers at T.O.T.S. as he won \"Delivery Bird of the Month\" ten consecutive times, thus Pip and Freddy see him as a role model. He was also the company's fastest deliverer until he was succeeded by Ava who in turn was succeeded by Bodhi.\n* Paulie (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 A parrot who is the air traffic controller at T.O.T.S. and often speaks his sentences twice.\n* Mr. Woodbird (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) \u2013 A woodpecker who is the janitor at T.O.T.S. who sometimes gives Pip and Freddy ideas that are solutions to their problems.\n* Mia (voiced by Charlie Townsend) \u2013 A baby kitten, who is the adopted daughter of Captain Beakman. Her catchphrase is \"Mia help! Mia help!\" when someone wants help with something, but even she needs help. In the episode \"Lend Me Your Paw\", she looks up to Pip and Freddy. She is the only baby whose name does not start with the same letter as her animal type.\n* Peggy (voiced by Angelica Hale) - A polar bear who wanted a better baby brother than Paul until she heard he got stuck in a small cave in the episode \"Bringing Back Baby\".\n\n===Minor===\n====Babies====\nSome of the babies are toddler animals who have each skill and ability in each episode. They are delivered by both Pip and Freddy on their deliveries. Some are background characters. \n* Kiki (voiced by Amari McCoy) \u2013 A baby kitten who used to think that Pip and Freddy were her parents until she met her real ones.\n* Wyatt (voiced by Remy Edgerly) \u2013 A baby whale who was really big and took a lot of flyers to deliver.\n* Precious (voiced by Amari McCoy) \u2013 A baby panda that was so cute and dangerously adorable, that she was impossible to say goodbye to. The only way to get out of her spell is to get reminded that she has a family of her own.\n* Scooter (voiced by Boone Nelson) \u2013 A baby skunk that likes to play ball, but no one wanted to play with him due to his skunk stink unless someone wore a helmet to prevent them from smelling his stench.\n* Chase (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) \u2013 A baby cheetah. He is impossible to catch, but can only be caught when he's asleep.\n* Ducklings (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 Baby ducks that communicate with cute quacking noises.\n* Tara (voiced by [[Abby Ryder Fortson]]) \u2013 A baby tapir. Pip and Freddy didn't know that she was a tapir at first due to the fact that they thought her parents weren't part of her species because she has stripes and her parents don't.\n* Marty (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) \u2013 A baby monkey who lived at the nursery and loves to pretend to be a junior Flyer until in the episode \"Monkeying Around and Around\", when Pip and Freddy delivered him to his forever family.\n* Blinky (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) \u2013 A light purple bunny who blinks a lot.\n* Bouncy (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) \u2013 A dark purple bunny who bounces a lot.\n* Blondy (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) \u2013 A yellow bunny who is named that because of her blondish fur.\n* Burpy (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) \u2013 A gray bunny who has a bad habit of burping.\n* Bushy (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) \u2013 A blue bunny with a white bushy afro. \n* Bobtail (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) \u2013 An orange bunny that shakes her tail a lot. \n* Octavia (voiced by Charlie Townsend) \u2013 A baby octopus with a big heart who was delivered in a special crate filled of water.\n* Diane (voiced by Charlie Townsend) \u2013 A baby donkey who likes eating grass.\n* Cam (voiced by Hudson Cordero) \u2013 A baby chameleon who has the ability to change colors and patterns and mimic other animals, which made him extremely hard to find.\n* Pablo (voiced by Max Mitchell) \u2013 A baby puppy who can bury anything, which is sort of a problem for Pip and Freddy since he buried their FlyPad in the episode \"Diggity Dog\".\n* Sunny (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) \u2013 A baby sloth who does everything, even speaks slowly.\n* Benny (voiced by Ayden Soria) \u2013 A baby bat who lives inside a cave that looks like a monster, is afraid of the light, and can navigate through the dark due to the fact that he's nocturnal.\n* Didi (voiced by Elsa George) \u2013 A baby deer who managed to walk in just a day and is not afraid of bumpy flights.\n* Penn (voiced by Ryan Soria) \u2013 A baby penguin who lives in Pip's hometown of Iceburg Alley and acts like a little brother to Pip.\n* Linus (voiced by Hudson Cordero) \u2013 A baby lion who needed to learn how to be quiet, since his roar was very loud, scaring everyone and shaking  everything.\n* Pearl (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) \u2013 A baby pig who is hard to please when it comes to presents, but loves mud like any other pig. She also has the intelligence to call her parents Mommy and Daddy instead of Mama and Dada.\n* Tiberius (voiced by Julian Edwards) \u2013 A baby white tiger prince who doesn't mind getting dirty.\n* Kiera (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) \u2013 A baby kangaroo who bounces a lot and can cause bumpy flights, unless someone was in the crate with her to keep her entertained or if she was asleep.\n* Petey (voiced by Boone Nelson) \u2013 A baby porcupine who was scared of the tube system until Pip and Freddy used his love of Choo-Choo trains to help him be brave. \n* Betty and Bobby (voiced by Elsa George and Max Mitchell respectively) \u2013 Baby bear siblings.\n* Kenny and Penny (voiced by Boone Nelson and Amari McCoy respectively) \u2013 A baby kitten and puppy who happen to be siblings who used to fight with each other, until they learned  to share their stuff.\n* Gil (voiced by Nick A.
