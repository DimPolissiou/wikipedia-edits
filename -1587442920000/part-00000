The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]?

Kim says she does not want Jimmy to go, because he is a lawyer not a \u201cbagman\u201d for drug dealers, but he says it will be an easy job. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash to Jimmy, then depart. As Jimmy starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen. They take the money and prepare to kill him but are attacked by an unseen sniper. All but one are killed and the survivor escapes. The shooter is Mike, who drives off with Jimmy and the cash. Jimmy's car breaks down, so they push it over the edge of the road, then walk cross-country to avoid the gunman. They camp overnight, then continue their trek. When Jimmy fails to return, Kim asks Lalo for his location, but Lalo refuses. The gunman continues searching, so Jimmy acts as decoy and draws him in. Mike shoots the gunman, whose vehicle flips and is destroyed.

Gus realizes the men who ambushed Jimmy were hired by Juan Bolsa to protect Gus\u2019s business. Jimmy lies to Kim about what happened, but Kim realizes the truth after she sees the bullet hole in his coffee mug. Kim quits Schweikart and Cokely to focus on pro bono clients.

As Mike trains his sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert walk, then asks about the bullet holes in Jimmy\u2019s car. Kim tells Lalo the car was probably destroyed by passersby and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied with Kim's argument and departs.

Kim accepts 20 pending felonies from the public defender ''pro bono''. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m. Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard warns Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. Mike tells Jimmy Lalo will be killed. Lalo introduces Nacho to Eladio. Eladio gives his blessing to Nacho's plans for the Salamanca drug business. Jimmy tells Kim Lalo will be not be a problem anymore. They discuss forcing a Sandpiper case resolution by sabotaging Howard, which would enable Jimmy to receive at least a million dollars as his share of the settlement but Jimmy is disturbed by Kim's eagerness.

The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point?

Nacho reports rumors that some cocaine Gus provides the Salamancas is inferior, which Lalo confirms. Gus tells Lalo and Juan Bolsa that Werner was building a chiller on the chicken farm under Mike's supervision, but fled with stolen cocaine, which Gus replaced with locally-acquired meth. Lalo accepts Gus' cover story but remains suspicious. Saul gives away his remaining cell phones to publicize his criminal law practice. Gus shuts down lab construction because of Lalo's suspicions and Mike sends Werner's crew home. Upset over Gus' lack of compassion for Werner, Mike refuses to accept payment during the downtime. Saul's camera crew helps generate publicity for his practice by faking a confrontation with Deputy District Attorney Oakley. Kim's client refuses a favorable plea bargain.

Two drug users who received Saul's 50% off business card go on a multi-day binge. As they attempt to buy more cocaine at the Salamanca drug house, the bags get stuck in the drainpipe. Domingo\u2019s attempt to solve the problem causes the drugs to fall out just as police arrive. Nacho gains Lalo's favor by climbing over rooftops to sneak in and retrieve the drug stash before police enter. Mike remains upset over Werner's death and drinks heavily. He babysits Kaylee, who asks questions about her father, causing Mike to lash out angrily. Jimmy attempts to get back into Kim's good graces. She tells Jimmy she appreciated his effort to persuade her client to accept a plea bargain but does not want to lie to succeed. As Saul, Jimmy turns on the charm at the courthouse and makes several favorable plea bargains, then tricks Assistant District Attorney Ericsen into making more after he arranges to be stuck with her in an elevator.

Jimmy discovers that Lalo plans to use him more in the future. Nacho tries to have someone purchase his father's upholstery shop so his father can retire safely away from the drug world, but his father sees through the ruse. Nacho reveals to Gus Lalo's plan for Domingo, and Gus decides not to interfere because doing so would reveal that he has a mole in the Salamanca organization. Mike continues wallowing over Werner's death. Kim is pulled from a day of ''pro bono'' criminal defense work to deal with a stubborn homeowner who refuses to leave his land to make way for a Mesa Verde call center.

Mike refuses to engage in killing simply to further Gus' aims, but Gus says he wants Mike because Mike understands Gus' need for revenge. Jimmy as Saul creates delays in Mesa Verde's eviction of Acker. Kim tries to recuse herself from the case by claiming a conflict of interest, but Kevin insists she remain and refuses any compromises. Howard asks Jimmy to accept his offer to join HHM, and Jimmy claims he is still considering it. Jimmy suggests there are no options left for Acker but to find \"dirt\" on Kevin and tries to persuade Kim to move on, but she decides to proceed.

The devices enable users to speak voice commands to interact with services through idk what it means [[Google Assistant]], the company's [[virtual assistant]]. Both in-house and third-party services are integrated, allowing users to listen to music, control playback of videos or photos, or receive news updates entirely by voice. Google Nest devices also have integrated support for [[home automation]], letting users control smart home appliances with their voice command. The first device, Google Home, was released in the United States in November 2016; subsequent product releases occurred globally from 2017\u20132019.\n\nThrough software updates to Google Nest devices and Google Assistant, additional functionality has been added over time. For example, multiple speakers can be set up for synchronized playback of music. An update in April 2017 brought multi-user support, allowing the device to distinguish between up to six people by voice. In May 2017, Google announced multiple updates, including: hands-free phone calling at no cost in Canada and the United States; proactive reminders ahead of scheduled events; visual responses on mobile devices or [[Chromecast]]-enabled televisions; [[Bluetooth]] audio streaming; and the ability to add reminders and calendar appointments.\n\nThe original Google Home speaker released in November 2016 featured a cylindrical shape with colored status [[LED]]s on top. In October 2017, Google announced two additions to the product lineup, the miniature puck-shaped Google Home Mini and a larger Google Home Max. In October 2018, the company released the Google Home Hub, a smart speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen. In May 2019, Google announced that Google Home devices would be rebranded under the Google Nest banner. After the announcement, Google unveiled the Google Nest Hub Max, a model with a larger smart display.\n\n==Current models==\n[[File:Nest Mini 2nd gen. cropped image.jpg|left|thumb|A Nest Mini (2nd gen.) in charcoal.]]\n\n==={{Anchor|Nest Mini|Nest Mini}} Nest Mini===\n\nOn October 15, 2019, Google unveiled a second-generation model branded as '''Nest Mini''', which was released on October 22, 2019.

It is nearly-identical in design to the first-generation Home Mini, except its cover is now made from recycled plastic. The back of the Nest Mini contains a hole for wall-mounting with a screw, and it contains LED lights that highlight the touch areas for volume control.

a user of any '''Google Nest''' device (previously known as Google Home), must register and sync to an account, using the Google Home application. In the Google Home app, there is an option in the settings to match the user's voice to the device by teaching the Google assistant your voice. The Google voice technology can be used in [[digital forensics]], where the words 'OK, Google' are capable of unlocking mobile locks. A mobile device can be found, unlocked, and data can be extracted through the use of a suspect's voice file. 'Hey Google' or 'Ok Google' can also be used to wake up the device. Some features of the '''Google Nest''' require the voice to be verified as the device can tell if it is being used by the owner. The Google device can also tell if it is connected to other smart devices which can find stored data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Park, Min|first=James, Joshua|title=Preliminary Study of a Google Home Mini|publisher=|year=January 13, 2020|isbn=|location=|pages=1-2}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Original Google Home speaker ===\nThe original Google Home received favorable reviews.

Pierce praised the look of Google Home, writing that it feels \"minimalist, thoughtful, and warm\" in the environment, and also praised its speaker, describing it as \"richer, brighter and more dynamic than the Echo, and loud enough to fill a room\". While noting that Home's use of the Google Assistant functioned in different ways than it does through the [[Google Allo|Allo]] app or [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel smartphone]], meaning quick instructions rather than longer tasks, he praised its search abilities, writing that \"you\u2019d expect Home to excel at search.

If you want to play audio on a Google Home, the service needs to have a Google Cast button\". He similarly criticized the Assistant's lack of cross-device functionality, writing that \"Pretty much all the actions you send to a Google Home will stay on that Google Home, and there's never an interaction with your phone\", and he noted concerns and questions regarding whether Google has an intention to incorporate the functionality deeper into its product lines.

The devices enable users to speak voice commands to interact with services through [[Google Assistant]], the company's [[virtual assistant]]. Both in-house and third-party services are integrated, allowing users to listen to music, control playback of videos or photos, or receive news updates entirely by voice. Google Nest devices also have integrated support for [[home automation]], letting users control smart home appliances with their voice command. The first device, Google Home, was released in the United States in November 2016; subsequent product releases occurred globally from 2017\u20132019.\n\nThrough software updates to Google Nest devices and Google Assistant, additional functionality has been added over time. For example, multiple speakers can be set up for synchronized playback of music. An update in April 2017 brought multi-user support, allowing the device to distinguish between up to six people by voice. In May 2017, Google announced multiple updates, including: hands-free phone calling at no cost in Canada and the United States; proactive reminders ahead of scheduled events; visual responses on mobile devices or [[Chromecast]]-enabled televisions; [[Bluetooth]] audio streaming; and the ability to add reminders and calendar appointments.\n\nThe original Google Home speaker released in November 2016 featured a cylindrical shape with colored status [[LED]]s on top. In October 2017, Google announced two additions to the product lineup, the miniature puck-shaped Google Home Mini and a larger Google Home Max. In October 2018, the company released the Google Home Hub, a smart speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen. In May 2019, Google announced that Google Home devices would be rebranded under the Google Nest banner. After the announcement, Google unveiled the Google Nest Hub Max, a model with a larger smart display.\n\n==Current models==\n[[File:Nest Mini 2nd gen. cropped image.jpg|left|thumb|A Nest Mini (2nd gen.) in charcoal.]]\n\n==={{Anchor|Nest Mini|Nest Mini}} Nest Mini===\n\nOn October 15, 2019, Google unveiled a second-generation model branded as '''Nest Mini''', which was released on October 22, 2019.

a user of any '''Google Nest''' device (previously known as Google Home), must register and sync to an account, using the Google Home application. In the Google Home app, there is an option in the settings to match the user's voice to the device by teaching the Google assistant your voice. The Google voice technology can be used in [[digital forensics]], where the words 'OK, Google' are capable of unlocking mobile locks. A mobile device can be found, unlocked, and data can be extracted through the use of a suspect's voice file. 'Hey Google' or 'Ok Google' can also be used to wake up the device. Some features of the '''Google Nest''' require the voice to be verified as the device can tell if it is being used by the owner. The Google device can also tell if it is connected to other smart devices which can find stored data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Park, Min|first=James, Joshua|title=Preliminary Study of a Google Home Mini|publisher=|year=January 13, 2020|isbn=|location=|pages=1-2}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Original Google Home speaker ===\nThe original Google Home received favorable reviews.  The Google Home's design and sound input/output received significant praise, while a lack of interoperability between other Google Assistant-enabled devices was criticized. Critics also expressed concerns about Google's intentions with the device, particularly whether or not features would be more tightly integrated into other Google products.\n\nDavid Pierce of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' compared Google Home to [[Amazon Echo]], writing in a summary that \"Sometimes Home feels like sci-fi magic.<ref name=wired/> Sometimes it reaches beyond its grasp and falls flat. The Echo is less impressive, but more reliable\". Pierce praised the look of Google Home, writing that it feels \"minimalist, thoughtful, and warm\" in the environment, and also praised its speaker, describing it as \"richer, brighter and more dynamic than the Echo, and loud enough to fill a room\". While noting that Home's use of the Google Assistant functioned in different ways than it does through the [[Google Allo|Allo]] app or [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel smartphone]], meaning quick instructions rather than longer tasks, he praised its search abilities, writing that \"you\u2019d expect Home to excel at search. It does\", despite some wrong search hiccups. Pierce criticized its lack of interoperability with other Google Assistant-enabled devices, though he called its future potential for connecting information across Google's product lines \"enormous\".<ref name=wired>{{cite web |first=David |last=Pierce |title=Review: Google Home |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/11/review-google-home/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=November 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRon Amadeo of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' praised Google Home's setup process and its ability to pick up voice commands even from a distance, calling the latter \"absolutely incredible\". He noted the device's limiting of its [[Bluetooth]] capabilities at the time (before the May 2017 update),<ref name=\"bluetooth\" /> however, writing that \"it's important to know that Google Home is not a Bluetooth speaker; it's purely a [[Google Cast]] device. If you want to play audio on a Google Home, the service needs to have a Google Cast button\". He similarly criticized the Assistant's lack of cross-device functionality, writing that \"Pretty much all the actions you send to a Google Home will stay on that Google Home, and there's never an interaction with your phone\", and he noted concerns and questions regarding whether Google has an intention to incorporate the functionality deeper into its product lines. Additionally, in his summary, he wrote that \"Why pay $129 for a device that is less capable than an Android phone?\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Google Home review: A step forward for hotwords, a step backward in capability |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/11/google-home-review-a-step-forward-for-hotwords-a-step-backward-in-capability/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=November 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[IFTTT]]\n* [[Invoke (smart speaker)|Invoke]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://www.cnet.com/products/google-home/review/ CNET Review] (Home)\n* [https://www.cnet.com/news/google-home-mini-review/ CNET Review] (Home Mini)\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Google Home}}\n* {{Official website|home.google.com}}\n* {{ITunes Preview App|680819774|Google Home}}\n* {{Google Play|com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app|Google Home}}\n\n{{Google Inc.}}\n{{Intelligent personal assistant software}}\n{{Ambient intelligence}}\n{{Embedded systems}}\n{{Smart speaker}}\n\n[[Category:Google hardware|Home]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2016]]\n[[Category:Smart speakers]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2017]]\n", "name_user": "101.164.0.160", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Home"}

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run.

Costumes were designed by Madeleine Bundy. The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes.

It was directed by Seanna Kennedy, produced by Joseph Patrick and Stage Managed by Alyssa Obrigewitsch, with set & props design by Michael Nicholas Galloro, costume design by Rachelle Bradley, and lighting design by Mikael Kangas. It ran untill August 4th, 2019\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n\n!<big>Lower Ossington Theatre (2019)</big>\n\nToronto, Canada\n\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n!Mark Willett\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n!Scott Labonte\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n!Rae Bernakevitch\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run. Co-produced by Stephen Stout and Colin Waitt, the production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for eight months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Costumes were designed by Madeleine Bundy. The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

The first is that the metabolic activity will be higher during waking and thus will secrete more beta-amyloid protein.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> The second is that oxidative stress will also be higher and lead to increased AB production.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nOn the other hand, it is during sleep that beta-amyloid residues are degraded to prevent plaque formation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> It is the glymphatic system that is responsible for this and this phenomenon is called glymphatic clearance.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> Thus, during wakefulness, the AB burden is greater because the metabolic activity and oxidative stress are higher and there is no degradation of the protein by the glymphatic clearance whereas during sleep, the burden will be smaller as there will be less metabolic activity and oxidative stress in addition to the glymphatic clearance that occurs at this time.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":14\" />\n\nInterestingly, the glymphatic cleanrance occurs during the NREM sleep, and more specifically the NREM SWS sleep.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> As seen previously, it is a sleep stage that decreases in normal aging.<ref name=\":15\" /> So there is less glymphatic clearance and an increase in AB burden that will form the AB plaques.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Therefore, in AD sleep disturbances will amplify this phenomenon.\n\nThe decrease in the quantity and quality of the NREM SWS as well as the disturbances of sleep will therefore increase the AB plaques.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> This will first take place at the hippocampus level, from which memory is

disorders there are, the more the disease progresses, forming a vicious circle.<ref name=\":14\" /> Taken this into account, sleep disturbances are no longer a symptom of AD and relationship between

The first is that the metabolic activity will be higher during waking and thus will secrete more beta-amyloid protein.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> The second is that oxidative stress will also be higher and lead to increased AB production.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nOn the other hand, it is during sleep that beta-amyloid residues are degraded to prevent plaque formation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> It is the glymphatic system that is responsible for this and this phenomenon is called glymphatic clearance.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> Thus, during wakefulness, the AB burden is greater because the metabolic activity and oxidative stress are higher and there is no degradation of the protein by the glymphatic clearance whereas during sleep, the burden will be smaller as there will be less metabolic activity and oxidative stress in addition to the glymphatic clearance that occurs at this time.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":14\" />\n\nInterestingly, the glymphatic cleanrance occurs during the NREM sleep, and more specifically the NREM SWS sleep.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> As seen previously, it is a sleep stage that decreases in normal aging.<ref name=\":15\" /> So there is less glymphatic clearance and an increase in AB burden that will form the AB plaques.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Therefore, in AD sleep disturbances will amplify this phenomenon.\n\nThe decrease in the quantity and quality of the NREM SWS as well as the disturbances of sleep will therefore increase the AB plaques.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> This will first take place at the hippocampus level, from which memory is dependent.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> This will result in cell death at this level and will contribute to diminished memory performances and cognitive decline found in AD disease.<ref

disorders there are, the more the disease progresses, forming a vicious circle.<ref name=\":14\" /> Taken this into account, sleep disturbances are no longer a symptom of AD and relationship between sleep disturbances and AD is bidirectional.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAt the same time, it has been shown that memory consolidation in long-term memory (which depends on the hippocampus) occurs during NREM sleep.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Diekelmann|first=Susanne|last2=Born|first2=Jan|date=February 2010|title=The memory function of sleep|journal=Nature Reviews

therefore poorer memory performances in hippocampal-dependent long-term memory.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":17\" /> This drop in performance is one of the central symptoms of AD.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nRecent studies have also linked sleep disturbances, neurogenesis and AD.<ref name=\":14\" /> Indeed, it is now known that neurogenesis exists and that the subgranular zone and the subventricular zone keep on creating new neurons even in an adult brain.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Meerlo|first=Peter|last2=Mistlberger|first2=Ralph E.|last3=Jacobs|first3=Barry

supragranular zone is found in the hippocampus.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":18\" /> These new cells will contribute to learning and memory and will play a role in the hippocampal-dependent memory.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nRecent studies, however, have shown that several factors can interrupt this neurogenesis.<ref name=\":14\" /> These include stress and prolonged sleep deprivation (more than one day).<ref name=\":14\" /> The sleep disturbances encountered in AD could therefore suppress neurogenesis and thus impairing hippocampal functions.<ref name=\":14\" /> This would therefore contribute to diminished memory performances and the progression of AD.<ref name=\":14\" /> And progression of AD would aggravate sleep disturbances.<ref name=\":14\" /> It is a second vicious circle.\n\nFinally, an interesting aspect is that the changes in sleep architecture found in patients with AD occur during the preclinical phase of AD.<ref name=\":14\" /> These changes could be used to detect those most at risk of developing AD.<ref name=\":14\" /> However, this is still only theoretical.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanisms and the causal relationship between sleep disturbances and AD are not yet clear, these findings already provide a better understanding. In addition, they open up ideas for the implementation of treatments to curb the cognitive decline of patients suffering from this disease. In the same way, it also makes it possible to better target at risk population.\n\n== Sleep disorder symptoms in psychiatric illnesses ==\n\n=== Schizophrenia ===\nIn individuals with psychiatric illnesses, sleep disorders may include a variety of clinical symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, nightmares, sleep talking, sleep walking, and poor quality sleep, among various others.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite journal|last=Hombali|first=Aditi|last2=Seow|first2=Esmond|last3=Yuan|first3=Qi|last4=Chang|first4=Shi Hui Sherilyn|last5=Satghare|first5=Pratika|last6=Kumar|first6=Sunita|last7=Verma|first7=Swapna Kamal|last8=Mok|first8=Yee Ming|last9=Chong|first9=Siow Ann|last10=Subramaniam|first10=Mythily|date=2019-09-01|title=Prevalence and correlates of sleep disorder symptoms in psychiatric disorders|journal=Psychiatry Research|volume=279|pages=116\u2013122|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2018.07.009|pmid=30072039|issn=0165-1781|doi-access=free}}</ref> Sleep disturbances - insomnia, hypersomnia and delayed sleep-phase disorder - are quite prevalent in severe mental illnesses such as psychotic disorders.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Laskemoen|first=Jannicke Fj\u00e6ra|last2=Simonsen|first2=Carmen|last3=B\u00fcchmann|first3=Camilla|last4=Barrett|first4=Elizabeth Ann|last5=Bjella|first5=Thomas|last6=Lagerberg|first6=Trine Vik|last7=Vedal|first7=Trude Jahr|last8=Andreassen|first8=Ole A.|last9=Melle|first9=Ingrid|last10=Aas|first10=Monica|date=2019-05-01|title=Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders \u2013 a transdiagnostic perspective|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|language=en|volume=91|pages=6\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.02.006|pmid=30856497|issn=0010-440X|doi-access=free}}</ref> In those with [[schizophrenia]] sleep disorders contribute to cognitive deficits in learning and memory.

The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and sleep disorders had been founded, and a need for standards arose.\n\nSpecialists in Sleep Medicine were originally certified by the [[American Board of Sleep Medicine]], which still recognizes specialists. Those passing the Sleep Medicine Specialty Exam received the designation \"diplomate of the [[American Board of Sleep Medicine|ABSM]].\" Sleep Medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within [[internal medicine]], [[family medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] in the [[United States]]. Certification in Sleep Medicine shows that the specialist:<blockquote>\"has demonstrated expertise in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions that occur during sleep, that disturb sleep, or that are affected by disturbances in the wake-sleep cycle. This specialist is skilled in the analysis and interpretation of comprehensive polysomnography, and well-versed in emerging research and management of a sleep laboratory.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abms.org/Who_We_Help/Physicians/specialties.aspx|title=American Board of Medical Specialties : Recognized Physician Specialty and Subspecialty Certificates|accessdate=2008-07-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508025259/http://www.abms.org/who_we_help/physicians/specialties.aspx|archivedate=2012-05-08}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nCompetence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a myriad of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar [[symptom]]s such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional [[sleep deprivation]], \"is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder\", such as sleep apnea, [[narcolepsy]], [[idiopathic hypersomnia]], [[Kleine\u2013Levin syndrome]], menstrual-related hypersomnia, [[idiopathic]] recurrent stupor, or [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders|circadian rhythm disturbances]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3810/pgm.2000.03.932 |title=What is causing excessive daytime sleepiness?

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]].

Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation).

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases. [[File:Special Service Unit Agents Circa 1998.jpg|thumb|SSU special agents on a parole sweep circa 1998]]\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Final 1.jpg|thumb|CDCR Special Service Unit agents making an arrest]]\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates. As a result, the court ruled in June 2005 and issued an order on October 3, 2005 putting the CDCR's medical health care delivery system in [[receivership]], citing the \"depravity\" of the system.<ref>{{cite news | first= James | last= Sterngold | title= U.S. seizes state prison health care | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/07/01/MNGOCDHPP71.DTL | work= San Francisco Chronicle | date= July 5, 2005 | accessdate=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> In February 2006, the judge appointed Robert Sillen to the position<ref>{{cite news | first= Solomon | last= Moore | title= Using Muscle to Improve Health Care for Prisoners | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/us/27prisons.html | work= New York Times | date=August 27, 2007 | accessdate=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> and Sillen was replaced by J.

On September 13, 1995 the court found the delivery of mental health care violated the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and issued an order for injunctive relief requiring defendants to develop plans to remedy the constitutional violations under the supervision of a [[special master]].\n\nFollowing the Governor's issuance of the State of Emergency Proclamation, the plaintiffs in ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' filed motions to convene a three-judge court to limit the prison population. On July 23, 2007 both the ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' courts granted the plaintiff's motions and recommended that the cases be assigned to the same three-judge court.<ref name=\"MooreNYT\"/> The Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and, on July 26, 2007, convened the instant three-judge district court pursuant to {{usc|28|2284}}.\n\nAs of 2008\u201309 fiscal year, the state of California spent approximately $16,000 per inmate per year on prison health care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/handouts/crimjust/2010/Correctional_health_care_03_18_10.pdf|title=Overview of Adult Correctional Health Care Spending}}</ref> This amount was by far the largest in the country and more than triple the $4,400 spent per inmate in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/spe01.pdf|title=State Prison Expenditures, 2001}}</ref> The state with the second largest prison population in the country, Texas, spent less than $4,000 per inmate per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/uchealth/2010/05/20/prison-health-update/|title=Prison health update}}</ref>\n\n=='''Prison Escapes'''==\n\nThe number of prison escapes from California prisons is not officially published anywhere.

Inmate [[Glen Godwin]] was able to escape the then maximum security prison. He reportedly escaped through a storm drain and into the American River. Godwin has been featured on several television documentaries as well as being on the FBI's Most Wanted List for twenty years.

Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.<ref>{{cite news |title=Convicted murderer caught after escaping during prison transport |url=https://abc7news.com/jeffery-scott-landers-convicted-murderer-escapes-during-prison-transport-in-merced-county/237543/ |work=ABC7 San Francisco |date=4 August 2014 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Union: California Correctional Peace Officers Association==\n{{Further|California Correctional Peace Officers Association }}\nOfficers of the department are represented by the California Correctional Peace Officers Association (the CCPOA).

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Final 1.jpg|thumb|CDCR Special Service Unit agents making an arrest]]\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

On September 13, 1995 the court found the delivery of mental health care violated the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and issued an order for injunctive relief requiring defendants to develop plans to remedy the constitutional violations under the supervision of a [[special master]].\n\nFollowing the Governor's issuance of the State of Emergency Proclamation, the plaintiffs in ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' filed motions to convene a three-judge court to limit the prison population. On July 23, 2007 both the ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' courts granted the plaintiff's motions and recommended that the cases be assigned to the same three-judge court.<ref name=\"MooreNYT\"/> The Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and, on July 26, 2007, convened the instant three-judge district court pursuant to {{usc|28|2284}}.\n\nAs of 2008\u201309 fiscal year, the state of California spent approximately $16,000 per inmate per year on prison health care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/handouts/crimjust/2010/Correctional_health_care_03_18_10.pdf|title=Overview of Adult Correctional Health Care Spending}}</ref> This amount was by far the largest in the country and more than triple the $4,400 spent per inmate in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/spe01.pdf|title=State Prison Expenditures, 2001}}</ref> The state with the second largest prison population in the country, Texas, spent less than $4,000 per inmate per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/uchealth/2010/05/20/prison-health-update/|title=Prison health update}}</ref>\n\n=='''Prison Escapes'''==\n\nThe number of prison escapes from California prisons is not officially published anywhere.
