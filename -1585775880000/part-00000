In particular it shows the lives of [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Canadian]] settlers from the years 1899 to 1930. Buildings from surrounding communities have been moved to the historic site and restored to various years within the first part of the twentieth century.\n\n\"The Village\", as it is colloquially known, has a very strong commitment to [[Authenticity (reenactment)|historical authenticity]] and the concept of [[living history]].  The Village uses a technique known as [[first-person interpretation]] which requires that the costumed performers remain ''in character'' at all times (or as much as is feasibly possible).  Actors answer all questions as if it is the year their building portrays.  Although this technique is startling for some visitors at first, it allows for a much stronger experience of immersion in history than traditional [[third-person interpretation]] where the actor acknowledges that he is, in fact, in a museum.\n[[File:UCHV elevator.jpg|thumb|right|Home Grain Co.

{"title_page": "History of Angola", "text_new": "{{History of Angola}}\n{{Culture of Angola}}\n\n'''[[Angola]]''' is a country in southwestern Africa. The country's name derives from the [[Kimbundu]] word for king. It was first settled by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherer societies before the northern domains came under the rule of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] states such as [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] and [[Ndongo]]. From the 15th century, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonists]] began trading, and a settlement was established at [[Luanda]] during the 16th century. Portugal annexed territories in the region which were [[Colonial history of Angola|ruled as a colony]] from 1655, and Angola was incorporated as an [[Administrative divisions of Portugal|overseas province of Portugal]] in 1951. After the [[Angolan War of Independence]], which ended in April 1974 with [[Carnation Revolution|an army mutiny and leftist coup]] in [[Lisbon]], Angola achieved independence on November 11, 1975 through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. A few months before independence, Angola entered a period of [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that lasted up until 2002.\n\n== From prehistory to the sovereign country ==\n{{see also|Precolonial history of Angola|Colonial history of Angola|Angolan War of Independence}}\nThe area of current day [[Angola]] was inhabited during the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] eras, as attested by remains found in Luanda, Congo, and the [[Namibe desert]]. At the beginning of recorded history other cultures and people also arrived.\n\nThe first ones to settle were the [[San people]]. This changed at the beginning of the sixth century AD, when the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], already in possession of metal-working technology, ceramics and agriculture began migrating from the north. When they reached what is now Angola they encountered the San and other groups. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groupings that took on different ethnic characteristics.\n\nThe first large political entity in the area, known to history as the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], appeared in the thirteenth century and stretched from [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[river Kwanza]] in the south, and from the Atlantic in the west to the [[river Cuango]] in the east.\n\nThe wealth of the Kongo came mainly from agriculture. Power was in the hands of the Mani, aristocrats who occupied key positions in the kingdom and who answered only to the all-powerful King of the Kongo. [[Mbanza (territory)|Mbanza]] was the name given to a territorial unit administered and ruled by a Mani; [[Mbanza Congo]], the capital, had a population of over fifty thousand in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kongo was divided into six provinces and included some dependent kingdoms, such as [[Ndongo]] to the south. Trade was the main activity, based on highly productive agriculture and increasing exploitation of mineral wealth. In 1482, [[Portuguese caravel]]s commanded by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] arrived in the Congo{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}} and he explored the extreme north-western [[Geography of Angola|coast]] of what today is Angola in 1484.{{sfnp|Baynes|1878}} Other expeditions followed, and close relations were soon established between the two states. The Portuguese brought [[firearms]] and many other [[technological]] advances, as well as a new religion ([[Christianity]]); in return, the King of the Congo offered plenty of [[slave]]s, [[ivory]], and [[minerals]].\n\nThe [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony of Angola]] was founded in 1575 with the arrival of [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers. Its center at [[Luanda]] was granted the status of city in 1605.\n\nThe King of the Kongo soon converted to Christianity and adopted a similar political structure to the Europeans. He became a well-known figure in Europe, to the point of receiving missives from the [[Pope]].\n\nTo the south of the Kingdom of the Kongo, around the river Kwanza, there were various important states. The most important of these was the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] or Dongo, ruled by the ngolas. At the time of the arrival of the Portuguese, Ngola [[Kiluange]] was in power. By maintaining a policy of alliances with neighbouring states, he managed to hold out against the foreigners for several decades but was eventually beheaded in [[Luanda]]. Years later, the Ndongo rose to prominence again when Jinga Mbandi ([[Queen Jinga]]) took power. A wily politician, she kept the Portuguese in check with carefully prepared agreements. After undertaking various journeys she succeeded in 1635 in forming a grand coalition with the states of [[Matamba]] and Ndongo, Kongo, [[Kassanje]], [[Dembos]] and [[Kissamas]]. At the head of this formidable alliance, she forced the Portuguese to retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, Portugal had lost its King and the Spanish took control of the Portuguese monarchy. By this time, Portugal's overseas territories had taken second place. The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] took advantage of this situation and occupied Luanda in 1641. Jinga entered into an alliance with the Dutch, thereby strengthening her coalition and confining the Portuguese to [[Massangano]], which they fortified strongly, sallying forth on occasion to capture slaves in the [[Kuata! Kuata! Wars]]. Slaves from Angola were essential to the development of the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]], but the traffic had been interrupted by these events. Portugal having regained its independence, a large force from Brazil under the command of [[Salvador Correia de S\u00e1]] retook Luanda in 1648, leading to the return of the Portuguese in large numbers. Jinga's coalition then fell apart; the absence of their Dutch allies with their firearms and the strong position of Correia de S\u00e1 delivered a deadly blow to the morale of the native forces. Jinga died in 1663; two years later, the King of the Congo committed all his forces to an attempt to capture the island of Luanda, occupied by Correia de S\u00e1, but they were defeated and lost their independence. The [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] submitted to the Portuguese Crown in 1671.\n\nTrade was mostly with the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Slave-trading routes and the conquests that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; independent states were subjugated to the demands of American slavery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the high plains (the Planalto), the most important states were those of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The interior remained largely free of Portuguese control as late as the 19th century.{{sfnp|Baynes|1878}}\n\nThe slave trade was not abolished until 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. This facilitated the continuation of slave smuggling to the United States and Brazil. By 1850, Luanda was one of the largest Portuguese cities in the [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]] exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products \u2013 almost all the produce of a continued forced labour system.\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference]] compelled Portugal to move towards the immediate occupation of all the territories it laid claim to but had been unable to effectively conquer. The territory of [[Cabinda (province)]], to the north of the river Zaire, was also ceded to Portugal on the legal basis of the [[Treaty of Simulambuko]] Protectorate, concluded between the [[Portuguese Crown]] and the princes of Cabinda in 1885. In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] encompassing the present territory was not established before the end of the 19th century, and \"effective occupation\", as required by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] was achieved only by the 1920s.\n\nColonial economic strategy was based on [[agriculture]] and the export of [[raw material]]s. Trade in [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], together with the taxes imposed on the population of the Empire (including the mainland), brought vast income to [[Lisbon]].\n\n[[File:Matr\u00edcula angolana em 1949.jpg|thumb|Car in Angola, in 1949.]]\n[[File:Ford Taunus 1972.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Taunus]] in Angola, in 1972]]\nPortuguese policy in Angola was modified by certain reforms introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The fall of the Portuguese monarchy and a favourable international climate led to reforms in administration, agriculture, and education. In 1951, with the advent of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] regime (''Estado Novo'') extended to the colony, Angola became a province of Portugal (Ultramarine Province), called the ''Prov\u00edncia Ultramarina de Angola'' ([[Overseas Province of Angola]]).\n\nHowever, Portuguese rule remained characterized by deep-seated racism, mass forced labour, and an almost complete failure to modernize the country. By 1960, after 400 years of colonial rule, there was not a single university in the entire territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uan.ao/|title=UAN|website=Universidade Agostinho Neto|language=pt-PT|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> To counter this lack of education facilities, overtly political organizations first appeared in the 1950s, and began to make organized demands for human and civil rights, initiating diplomatic campaigns throughout the world in their fight for independence. The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the nationalist's demands for independence, thereby provoking the armed conflict that started in 1961 when guerrillas attacked colonial assets in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]].<ref>See [[Christine Messiant]], ''L\u2019Angola colonial, histoire et soci\u00e9t\u00e9: Les pr\u00e9misses du mouvement nationaliste'', Basle: Schlettwein, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn this struggle, the principal protagonists were the [[MPLA]] (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA ([[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA ([[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict, the nation gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Portugal's new leaders began a process of democratic change at home and acceptance of the independence of its former colonies.\n\n==Civil war==\n{{main|Angolan Civil War|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration}}\nA [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'\u00e9tat]] in Portugal established a military government led by President [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]]. The Sp\u00ednola government agreed to give all of Portugal's colonies independence, and handed power in Angola over to a coalition of the three largest nationalist movements, the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA, through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. The coalition quickly broke down, however, and the country descended into civil war. The MPLA gained control of the capital Luanda and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, [[Za\u00efre]] and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuba intervened]] in favor of the MPLA. In the meantime the South Africans and UNITA had come as close as 200&nbsp;km to the south of the capital, the FNLA and Zairian forces as far as Kifangondo, 30&nbsp;km to the east.\n\nWith Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence as the [[Angolan People's Republic]] on November 11, 1975, the day the Portuguese left the country. [[Agostinho Neto]] became the first president. FNLA and UNITA proclaimed their own short-lived republics (the Angolan Democratic Republic and the Angolan Social Democratic Republic) on November 24, 1975, for the zones they controlled with [[Holden Roberto]] and [[Jonas Savimbi]] as [[Heads of state of the Democratic People's Republic of Angola|co-presidents]] of the [[Angolan People's Democratic Republic]] in Huambo. This joint FNLA-UNITA government was dissolved on February 11, 1976 after a MPLA offensive. By the end of January 1976 the MPLA army (FAPLA) and the Cubans had all but crushed FNLA, Zairians and UNITA, and the South African forces withdrew.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/angola/39.htm|title=Angola - INDEPENDENCE AND THE RISE OF THE MPLA GOVERNMENT|website=countrystudies.us|accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1977, a coup attempt, including some former members of the MPLA government such as [[Nito Alves]], led to retaliation by the government and Cuban forces, resulting in the execution of thousands, if not tens of thousands.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Name of the People: Angola's Forgotten Massacre|date=2014|isbn=978-1-78076-905-9|author=Lara Pawson|authorlink=Lara Pawson}}</ref> Alves was tortured and killed. The movement is known as [[Fraccionismo]].\n[[File:Soviet and East Bloc military advisors in Angola 1983.jpg|thumb|Soviet and East Bloc military advisors train MPLA troops in Angola, 1983]]\nThe proxy war continued. The MPLA government, recognized internationally (although not by the United States), requested that Cuban forces remain in the country. Led by Jonas Savimbi, UNITA received clandestine support from the U.S. and other nations and took up military resistance in the southeast of the country while the MPLA government was supported by the [[USSR]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. South Africa continued to pursue [[South-West Africa People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) forces in Southern Angola, soon established bases and increased support of UNITA, which gained control of more and more territory. In an effort to deliver a final blow to UNITA and to drive South Africa out of the country, in 1987 the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA), with Soviet support, launched a campaign fraught with failures and defeats. Again, the Cubans intervened, stopping UNITA and South African advances, leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] from January 13 to March 23, the largest battle in African history since World War II.\n\nThe MPLA and the U.S. had been in negotiations for a peaceful solution since June 1987. The U.S. agreed to include Cuba in direct talks. Cuba joined the negotiations January 28, 1988; South Africa joined March 9. Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] on December 22, 1988, in which the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola was linked to the retreat of South African soldiers from Angola and Namibia.\n\nThe [[Bicesse Accord]] in 1991 spelled out an electoral process for a democratic Angola under the supervision of the [[United Nations]]. MPLA won the first round with 49% of the votes, against 40% for UNITA. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the results and returned to war. From October 30 to November 1, 1992 the [[Halloween massacre (Angola)|Halloween Massacre]] occurred in which thousands of UNITA and FNLA supporters in Luanda were killed by MPLA troops. Estimates for the death toll nationwide reach 25,000 to 30,000.<ref name=angolamilitaryhistory>{{cite book|last=Weigert|first=Stephen|year=2011|title=Angola: A Modern Military History, 1961-2002|page=}}</ref><ref name=historicaldictionary>{{cite book|last=W.

However, in 1995, localized fighting resumed. A national unity government was installed in April 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998 when Savimbi renewed the war for a second time, claiming that the MPLA was not fulfilling its obligations. The [[UN Security Council]] voted on August 28, 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA. The Angolan military launched a massive offensive in 1999 that destroyed UNITA's conventional capacity and recaptured all major cities previously held by Savimbi's forces. Savimbi then declared that UNITA would return to guerrilla tactics, and much of the country remained in turmoil..\n\nThe extended civil war rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1 million lives may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century.

The country's name derives from the [[Kimbundu]] word for king. It was first settled by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherer societies before the northern domains came under the rule of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] states such as [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] and [[Ndongo]]. From the 15th century, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonists]] began trading, and a settlement was established at [[Luanda]] during the 16th century. Portugal annexed territories in the region which were [[Colonial history of Angola|ruled as a colony]] from 1655, and Angola was incorporated as an [[Administrative divisions of Portugal|overseas province of Portugal]] in 1951. After the [[Angolan War of Independence]], which ended in April 1974 with [[Carnation Revolution|an army mutiny and leftist coup]] in [[Lisbon]], Angola achieved independence on November 11, 1975 through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. A few months before independence, Angola entered a period of [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that lasted up until 2002.\n\n== From prehistory to the sovereign country ==\n{{see also|Precolonial history of Angola|Colonial history of Angola|Angolan War of Independence}}\nThe area of current day [[Angola]] was inhabited during the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] eras, as attested by remains found in Luanda, Congo, and the [[Namibe desert]]. At the beginning of recorded history other cultures and people also arrived.\n\nThe first ones to settle were the [[San people]]. This changed at the beginning of the sixth century AD, when the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], already in possession of metal-working technology, ceramics and agriculture began migrating from the north. When they reached what is now Angola they encountered the San and other groups. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groupings that took on different ethnic characteristics.\n\nThe first large political entity in the area, known to history as the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], appeared in the thirteenth century and stretched from [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[river Kwanza]] in the south, and from the Atlantic in the west to the [[river Cuango]] in the east.\n\nThe wealth of the Kongo came mainly from agriculture. Power was in the hands of the Mani, aristocrats who occupied key positions in the kingdom and who answered only to the all-powerful King of the Kongo. [[Mbanza (territory)|Mbanza]] was the name given to a territorial unit administered and ruled by a Mani; [[Mbanza Congo]], the capital, had a population of over fifty thousand in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kongo was divided into six provinces and included some dependent kingdoms, such as [[Ndongo]] to the south. Trade was the main activity, based on highly productive agriculture and increasing exploitation of mineral wealth. In 1482, [[Portuguese caravel]]s commanded by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] arrived in the Congo{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}} and he explored the extreme north-western [[Geography of Angola|coast]] of what today is Angola in 1484.{{sfnp|Baynes|1878}} Other expeditions followed, and close relations were soon established between the two states. The Portuguese brought [[firearms]] and many other [[technological]] advances, as well as a new religion ([[Christianity]]); in return, the King of the Congo offered plenty of [[slave]]s, [[ivory]], and [[minerals]].\n\nThe [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony of Angola]] was founded in 1575 with the arrival of [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers. Its center at [[Luanda]] was granted the status of city in 1605.\n\nThe King of the Kongo soon converted to Christianity and adopted a similar political structure to the Europeans. He became a well-known figure in Europe, to the point of receiving missives from the [[Pope]].\n\nTo the south of the Kingdom of the Kongo, around the river Kwanza, there were various important states. The most important of these was the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] or Dongo, ruled by the ngolas. At the time of the arrival of the Portuguese, Ngola [[Kiluange]] was in power. By maintaining a policy of alliances with neighbouring states, he managed to hold out against the foreigners for several decades but was eventually beheaded in [[Luanda]]. Years later, the Ndongo rose to prominence again when Jinga Mbandi ([[Queen Jinga]]) took power. A wily politician, she kept the Portuguese in check with carefully prepared agreements. After undertaking various journeys she succeeded in 1635 in forming a grand coalition with the states of [[Matamba]] and Ndongo, Kongo, [[Kassanje]], [[Dembos]] and [[Kissamas]]. At the head of this formidable alliance, she forced the Portuguese to retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, Portugal had lost its King and the Spanish took control of the Portuguese monarchy. By this time, Portugal's overseas territories had taken second place. The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] took advantage of this situation and occupied Luanda in 1641. Jinga entered into an alliance with the Dutch, thereby strengthening her coalition and confining the Portuguese to [[Massangano]], which they fortified strongly, sallying forth on occasion to capture slaves in the [[Kuata! Kuata! Wars]]. Slaves from Angola were essential to the development of the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]], but the traffic had been interrupted by these events. Portugal having regained its independence, a large force from Brazil under the command of [[Salvador Correia de S\u00e1]] retook Luanda in 1648, leading to the return of the Portuguese in large numbers. Jinga's coalition then fell apart; the absence of their Dutch allies with their firearms and the strong position of Correia de S\u00e1 delivered a deadly blow to the morale of the native forces. Jinga died in 1663; two years later, the King of the Congo committed all his forces to an attempt to capture the island of Luanda, occupied by Correia de S\u00e1, but they were defeated and lost their independence. The [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] submitted to the Portuguese Crown in 1671.\n\nTrade was mostly with the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Slave-trading routes and the conquests that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; independent states were subjugated to the demands of American slavery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the high plains (the Planalto), the most important states were those of [[Bi\u00e9 (province)|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The interior remained largely free of Portuguese control as late as the 19th century.{{sfnp|Baynes|1878}}\n\nThe slave trade was not abolished until 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. This facilitated the continuation of slave smuggling to the United States and Brazil. By 1850, Luanda was one of the largest Portuguese cities in the [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]] exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products \u2013 almost all the produce of a continued forced labour system.\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference]] compelled Portugal to move towards the immediate occupation of all the territories it laid claim to but had been unable to effectively conquer. The territory of [[Cabinda (province)]], to the north of the river Zaire, was also ceded to Portugal on the legal basis of the [[Treaty of Simulambuko]] Protectorate, concluded between the [[Portuguese Crown]] and the princes of Cabinda in 1885. In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] encompassing the present territory was not established before the end of the 19th century, and \"effective occupation\", as required by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] was achieved only by the 1920s.\n\nColonial economic strategy was based on [[agriculture]] and the export of [[raw material]]s. Trade in [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], together with the taxes imposed on the population of the Empire (including the mainland), brought vast income to [[Lisbon]].\n\n[[File:Matr\u00edcula angolana em 1949.jpg|thumb|Car in Angola, in 1949.]]\n[[File:Ford Taunus 1972.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Taunus]] in Angola, in 1972]]\nPortuguese policy in Angola was modified by certain reforms introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The fall of the Portuguese monarchy and a favourable international climate led to reforms in administration, agriculture, and education. In 1951, with the advent of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] regime (''Estado Novo'') extended to the colony, Angola became a province of Portugal (Ultramarine Province), called the ''Prov\u00edncia Ultramarina de Angola'' ([[Overseas Province of Angola]]).\n\nHowever, Portuguese rule remained characterized by deep-seated racism, mass forced labour, and an almost complete failure to modernize the country. By 1960, after 400 years of colonial rule, there was not a single university in the entire territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uan.ao/|title=UAN|website=Universidade Agostinho Neto|language=pt-PT|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> To counter this lack of education facilities, overtly political organizations first appeared in the 1950s, and began to make organized demands for human and civil rights, initiating diplomatic campaigns throughout the world in their fight for independence. The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the nationalist's demands for independence, thereby provoking the armed conflict that started in 1961 when guerrillas attacked colonial assets in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]].<ref>See [[Christine Messiant]], ''L\u2019Angola colonial, histoire et soci\u00e9t\u00e9: Les pr\u00e9misses du mouvement nationaliste'', Basle: Schlettwein, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn this struggle, the principal protagonists were the [[MPLA]] (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA ([[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA ([[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict, the nation gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Portugal's new leaders began a process of democratic change at home and acceptance of the independence of its former colonies.\n\n==Civil war==\n{{main|Angolan Civil War|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration}}\nA [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'\u00e9tat]] in Portugal established a military government led by President [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]]. The Sp\u00ednola government agreed to give all of Portugal's colonies independence, and handed power in Angola over to a coalition of the three largest nationalist movements, the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA, through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. The coalition quickly broke down, however, and the country descended into civil war. The MPLA gained control of the capital Luanda and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, [[Za\u00efre]] and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuba intervened]] in favor of the MPLA. In the meantime the South Africans and UNITA had come as close as 200&nbsp;km to the south of the capital, the FNLA and Zairian forces as far as Kifangondo, 30&nbsp;km to the east.\n\nWith Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence as the [[Angolan People's Republic]] on November 11, 1975, the day the Portuguese left the country. [[Agostinho Neto]] became the first president. FNLA and UNITA proclaimed their own short-lived republics (the Angolan Democratic Republic and the Angolan Social Democratic Republic) on November 24, 1975, for the zones they controlled with [[Holden Roberto]] and [[Jonas Savimbi]] as [[Heads of state of the Democratic People's Republic of Angola|co-presidents]] of the [[Angolan People's Democratic Republic]] in Huambo. This joint FNLA-UNITA government was dissolved on February 11, 1976 after a MPLA offensive. By the end of January 1976 the MPLA army (FAPLA) and the Cubans had all but crushed FNLA, Zairians and UNITA, and the South African forces withdrew.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/angola/39.htm|title=Angola - INDEPENDENCE AND THE RISE OF THE MPLA GOVERNMENT|website=countrystudies.us|accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1977, a coup attempt, including some former members of the MPLA government such as [[Nito Alves]], led to retaliation by the government and Cuban forces, resulting in the execution of thousands, if not tens of thousands.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Name of the People: Angola's Forgotten Massacre|date=2014|isbn=978-1-78076-905-9|author=Lara Pawson|authorlink=Lara Pawson}}</ref> Alves was tortured and killed. The movement is known as [[Fraccionismo]].\n[[File:Soviet and East Bloc military advisors in Angola 1983.jpg|thumb|Soviet and East Bloc military advisors train MPLA troops in Angola, 1983]]\nThe proxy war continued. The MPLA government, recognized internationally (although not by the United States), requested that Cuban forces remain in the country. Led by Jonas Savimbi, UNITA received clandestine support from the U.S. and other nations and took up military resistance in the southeast of the country while the MPLA government was supported by the [[USSR]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. South Africa continued to pursue [[South-West Africa People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) forces in Southern Angola, soon established bases and increased support of UNITA, which gained control of more and more territory. In an effort to deliver a final blow to UNITA and to drive South Africa out of the country, in 1987 the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA), with Soviet support, launched a campaign fraught with failures and defeats. Again, the Cubans intervened, stopping UNITA and South African advances, leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] from January 13 to March 23, the largest battle in African history since World War II.\n\nThe MPLA and the U.S. had been in negotiations for a peaceful solution since June 1987. The U.S. agreed to include Cuba in direct talks. Cuba joined the negotiations January 28, 1988; South Africa joined March 9. Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] on December 22, 1988, in which the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola was linked to the retreat of South African soldiers from Angola and Namibia.\n\nThe [[Bicesse Accord]] in 1991 spelled out an electoral process for a democratic Angola under the supervision of the [[United Nations]]. MPLA won the first round with 49% of the votes, against 40% for UNITA. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the results and returned to war. From October 30 to November 1, 1992 the [[Halloween massacre (Angola)|Halloween Massacre]] occurred in which thousands of UNITA and FNLA supporters in Luanda were killed by MPLA troops.

However, in 1995, localized fighting resumed. A national unity government was installed in April 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998 when Savimbi renewed the war for a second time, claiming that the MPLA was not fulfilling its obligations. The [[UN Security Council]] voted on August 28, 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA. The Angolan military launched a massive offensive in 1999 that destroyed UNITA's conventional capacity and recaptured all major cities previously held by Savimbi's forces. Savimbi then declared that UNITA would return to guerrilla tactics, and much of the country remained in turmoil..\n\nThe extended civil war rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1 million lives may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century.

Two gas-powered [[headlamp]]s provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim.

A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat. \n\nThe engines were a single-cylinder, four-stroke water cooled design, producing 6BHP, with power going to a chain-driven rear axle. The rear-axle disengaged one of the rear wheels while driving around a curve to avoid undue wear and tear on the drivetrain. A feature of engines designed by Brush was that they ran counter-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise. This was Brush's idea intended to make them safer for a right-handed person to crank-start by hand. Prior to the invention of the [[electric starter]], crank-starting a clockwise-running engines frequently resulted in dislocated thumbs and broken forearms if the hand crank kicked back on starting. \n\nAccording to a contemporary review from ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Jouranl'' in 1907, author Hugh Dolnar described the recently introduced Brush as a \"...very, very new and also very, very old, as will be seen from the detailed constrction illistrations below...\" In his critique of the Brush, Dolnar was referencing the decision to use wooden axles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lamond |first1=Robert A |title=The Brush Rounabout - everyman's car, 1907 to 1913 : a tribute to Alanson Partridge Brush, self taught engineer, designer and manufacturer of the Brush Rounabout |isbn=9780646949000 |pages=44 |url=https://brushownersregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Brush-Runabout-Everymans-Car.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Runabout, Brush advertised a $600 \"Package Car\" (also advertised as the \"Delivery Car\") based on the same chassis as the runabout.

The Brush Runabout Company, along with [[Maxwell-Briscoe]], [[Stoddard-Dayton]], and others formed [[Benjamin Briscoe]]'s [[United States Motor Company]](USMC) from 1910, ending when that company failed in 1913. [[Runabout (car)|Runabouts]], in general, fell out of vogue quickly, partly due to the lack of protection from the weather.\n\nAfter Brush and the other companies of the USMC became [[Maxwell Motor Company]], President [[Walter Flanders]] wrote in 1913 document \"Why We Did Not Use All Our Plants\", the Brush factory in Detroit (along with the [[Flanders (automobile company)|Flanders]] and [[Sampson (automobile)|Sampson]]  Plants) were to remain as factories.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Motor Age |date=January 2, 1913 |volume=Volume 23 |page=54-55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCofAQAAMAAJ&ppis=_c&lpg=RA11-PA54&ots=Ojh37-pidB&dq=Maxwell%20Motor%20Company%20Why%20We%20Did%20Not%20Use%20ALl%20Our%20Plants&pg=RA11-PA54#v=onepage&q=Maxwell%20Motor%20Company%20Why%20We%20Did%20Not%20Use%20ALl%20Our%20Plants&f=false |publisher=Class Journal Company}}</ref> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Design==\n\n===Brush===\n\nTouted as the \"Everyman's Car\", Brush designed a light car with a wooden chassis (wooden rails and iron cross-members), friction drive transmission and \"underslung\" coil springs in tension instead of compression on both sides of each axle. Two gas-powered [[headlamp]]s provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. Wider axles were available for use in the Southern region of the United States, where a 60-inch tread fit wagon ruts on country roads.<ref>{{cite web |title=Liberty-Brush automobile |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=3 March 2020 |archive-date=3 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903125759/http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1320.html}}</ref> The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a squeeze bulb affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat. \n\nThe engines were a single-cylinder, four-stroke water cooled design, producing 6BHP, with power going to a chain-driven rear axle. The rear-axle disengaged one of the rear wheels while driving around a curve to avoid undue wear and tear on the drivetrain. A feature of engines designed by Brush was that they ran counter-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise. This was Brush's idea intended to make them safer for a right-handed person to crank-start by hand. Prior to the invention of the [[electric starter]], crank-starting a clockwise-running engines frequently resulted in dislocated thumbs and broken forearms if the hand crank kicked back on starting. \n\nAccording to a contemporary review from ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Jouranl'' in 1907, author Hugh Dolnar described the recently introduced Brush as a \"...very, very new and also very, very old, as will be seen from the detailed constrction illistrations below...\" In his critique of the Brush, Dolnar was referencing the decision to use wooden axles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lamond |first1=Robert A |title=The Brush Rounabout - everyman's car, 1907 to 1913 : a tribute to Alanson Partridge Brush, self taught engineer, designer and manufacturer of the Brush Rounabout |isbn=9780646949000 |pages=44 |url=https://brushownersregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Brush-Runabout-Everymans-Car.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Runabout, Brush advertised a $600 \"Package Car\" (also advertised as the \"Delivery Car\") based on the same chassis as the runabout.

{"title_page": "History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan", "text_new": "{{History of Sudan}}\nThis article discusses the '''history''' of '''[[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]''' during the [[history of Sudan]] from 1899 to 1955. \n\nIn January 1899, an [[British Empire|Anglo]]-[[Egypt]]ian agreement restored Egyptian rule in [[Sudan]] but as part of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], or joint authority, exercised by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Egypt]]. The agreement designated territory south of the twenty-second parallel as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Although it emphasized Egypt's indebtedness to Britain for its participation in the reconquest, the agreement failed to clarify the juridical relationship between the two condominium powers in Sudan or to provide a legal basis for continued British governing of the territory on behalf of the [[Khedive]]. Article II of the agreement specified that <blockquote>\"the supreme military and civil command in Sudan shall be vested in one officer, termed the Governor-General of Sudan. He shall be appointed by Khedival Decree on the recommendation of Her Britannic Majesty's Government and shall be removed only by Khedival Decree with the consent of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.\"</blockquote> \n\nThe British governor-general, who was a military officer, reported to the [[Foreign Office]] through its resident agent in [[Cairo]]. In practice, however, he exercised extraordinary powers and directed the condominium government from [[Khartoum]] as if it were a colonial administration. [[Reginald Wingate|Sir Reginald Wingate]] succeeded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] as governor-general in 1899. \n\nIn each province, two inspectors and several district commissioners aided the British governor (''mudir''). Initially, nearly all administrative personnel were [[British Army]] officers attached to the [[Egyptian Army]]. In 1901, however, civilian administrators started arriving in the Sudan from Britain and formed the nucleus of the Sudan Political Service. Egyptians filled middle-level posts while Sudanese gradually acquired lower-level positions.\n\n==Condominium period==\n\nIn the condominium's early years, the governor-general and provincial governors exercised great latitude in governing the Sudan. After 1910, however, an executive council, whose approval was required for all legislation and for budgetary matters, assisted the governor-general. \n\nThe governor-general presided over this council, which included the inspector-general; the civil, legal, and financial secretaries; the General Officer Commanding the Troops (The Kaid);<ref name = SudanStory>Hyslop, J. (1952) : \u201cThe Sudan Story\u201d, Chapter \u201cThe Avenger Brings Peace\u201d, The Naldrett Press, London, UK</ref> and two to four other British officials appointed by the governor-general. From 1944 to 1948 there existed also an Advisory  Council for the Northern Sudan whose functions were advice and consultation.  This Advisory Council had 18 members representing Province Councils, 10 members nominated by the Governor-General and 2 honorary  members.<ref name = Almanac>Public Relations Department Sudan Government Khartoum  (1951) \u201cSudan Almanac 1951\u201d, McCorquodale & Co. (Sudan)</ref> The executive council retained legislative authority until 1948. \n\n===Law and order===\nAfter restoring order and the government's authority, the British dedicated themselves to creating a modern government in the condominium. Jurists adopted penal and criminal procedural codes similar to those in force in [[British Raj| British India]]. Commissions established land tenure rules and adjusted claims in dispute because of grants made by successive governments. Taxes on land remained the basic form of [[taxation]], the amount assessed depending on the type of [[irrigation]], the number of date palms, and the size of herds; however, the rate of taxation was fixed for the first time in Sudan's history. \n\nThe 1902 [[Code of Civil Procedure]] continued the [[Ottoman Law| Ottoman]] separation of civil law and [[sharia]], but it also created guidelines for the operation of sharia courts as an autonomous judicial division under a chief [[qadi]] appointed by the governor general. Religious judges and other sharia court officials were invariably Egyptian. \n\nThere was little resistance to the condominium. Breaches of the peace usually took the form of intertribal warfare or banditry. [[Mahdi]]st uprisings occurred in February 1900, in 1902\u20133, in 1904, and in 1908 but these revolts were of short duration. In 1916, [[Abd Allah as Suhayni]], who claimed to be the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]], launched an unsuccessful [[jihad]].\n\n===Undefined borders===\nThe problem of the condominium's undefined borders was a greater concern. A 1902 treaty with [[Ethiopia]] fixed the southeastern boundary with Sudan. Seven years later, an Anglo-[[Belgium|Belgian]] treaty determined the status of the [[Lado Enclave]] in the south establishing a border with the [[Belgian Congo]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). \n\nThe western boundary proved more difficult to resolve. [[Darfur]] was the only province formerly under Egyptian control that was not soon recovered under the condominium. When the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdiyah]] disintegrated, Sultan [[Ali Dinar]] reclaimed Darfur's throne, which had been lost to the Egyptians in 1874 and held the throne under Ottoman suzerainty, with British approval on condition that he pay annual tribute to the khedive. When World War I broke out, Ali Dinar proclaimed his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and responded to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]'s call for a jihad against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Britain, which had declared a protectorate over Egypt in 1914, sent a small force against Ali Dinar, who died in subsequent fighting. In 1916, the British annexed Darfur to Sudan and terminated the Fur sultanate.\n\n===Economic development===\nDuring the co-dominium period, economic development occurred only in the [[Nile Valley]]'s settled areas. In the first two decades of condominium rule, the British extended telegraph and rail lines to link key points in northern Sudan but services did not reach more remote areas. Port Sudan opened in 1906, replacing [[Sawakin]] as the country's principal outlet to the sea. \n\nIn 1911 the Sudanese government and the private Sudan Plantations Syndicate launched the [[Gezira Scheme]] (Gezira is also seen as Jazirah) to provide a source of high-quality cotton for Britain's textile industry. An irrigation [[Sennar Dam|dam near Sennar]], completed in 1925, brought a much larger area in [[Al Jazirah (state)|Al Jazirah]] under cultivation. Planters sent cotton by rail from Sannar to Port Sudan for shipment abroad. The Gezira Scheme made cotton the mainstay of the country's economy and turned the region into Sudan's most densely populated area.\n\n==Egyptian independence, fate of Sudan==\n\nIn 1922, Britain renounced the protectorate and approved [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|Egypt's declaration of independence]]. However, the 1923 Egyptian constitution made no claim to Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Subsequent negotiations in London between the British and the new Egyptian government foundered on the Sudan question. \n\nInflamed by the failure of the talks, nationalists rioted in Egypt and in Sudan where [[Ali Abd al Latif| a minority supported union]] with Egypt. In November 1924, Sir [[Lee Stack]], governor general of Sudan and Sirdar, was assassinated in Cairo. Britain ordered all Egyptian troops, civil servants, and public employees withdrawn from Sudan. In 1925, Khartoum formed the 4,500-man [[Sudan Defence Force]] (SDF) under Sudanese officers to replace Egyptian units.\n\n===Indirect rule===\nSudan was relatively quiet in the late 1920s and 1930s. During this period, the colonial government favored [[indirect rule]], which allowed the British to govern through indigenous leaders. \n\nIn Sudan, the traditional leaders were the shaykhs (of villages, tribes, and districts) in the north and tribal chiefs in the south. The British first delegated judicial powers to shaykhs to enable them to settle local disputes; then, gradually, they allowed the shaykhs to administer local government under the supervision of British district commissioners. The number of Sudanese recognizing these leaders and the degree of authority they wielded varied considerably. \n\nThe mainstream of political development, represented by other local leaders and Khartoum's educated elite, disapproved of indirect rule. In their view, it prevented the country's unification, exacerbated tribalism in the north, and in the south served to buttress a less-advanced society against Arab influence. Indirect rule also implied government decentralization, which alarmed the educated elite who had careers in the central administration and envisioned an eventual transfer of power from British colonial authorities to their class.\n\nNationalists and the [[Khatmiyyah]] opposed indirect rule, but the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (or followers of the Mahdi) supported the British approach since many of them enjoyed positions of local authority.\n\n==Britain's policy towards the South==\n\nFrom the beginning of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, the British sought to modernize Sudan by applying European technology to its underdeveloped economy and by replacing its authoritarian institutions with ones that adhered to liberal English traditions. \n\nSouthern Sudan's remote and undeveloped provinces&mdash;Equatoria, [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]], and Upper Nile&mdash;received little official attention until after World War I, however, except for efforts to suppress tribal warfare and the slave trade. The British justified this policy by claiming that the south was not ready for exposure to the modern world. To allow the south to develop along indigenous lines, the British, therefore, closed the region to outsiders. As a result, the south remained isolated. A few Arab merchants controlled the region's limited commercial activities while Arab bureaucrats administered whatever laws existed. Christian missionaries, who operated schools and medical clinics, provided limited social services in southern Sudan. \n\nThe earliest Christian missionaries were the [[Verona]] Fathers, a [[Roman Catholic]] religious order that had established southern missions before the Mahdiyah. Other missionary groups active in the south included [[Presbyterian]]s from the United States and the Anglican [[Church Missionary Society]]. There was no competition among these missions, largely because they maintained separate areas of influence. The government eventually subsidized the mission schools that educated southerners. Because mission graduates usually succeeded in gaining posts in the provincial civil service, many northerners regarded them as tools of British imperialism. The few southerners who received higher training attended schools in British East Africa (present-day [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) rather than in Khartoum, thereby exacerbating the north\u2013south division. \n\n===\"Closed-door\" ordinances===\nBritish authorities treated the three southern provinces as a separate region. The colonial administration, as it consolidated its southern position in the 1920s, detached the south from the rest of Sudan for all practical purposes. \n\nThe period's \"closed door\" ordinances, which barred northern Sudanese from entering or working in the south, reinforced this separate development policy. Moreover, the British gradually replaced Arab administrators and expelled Arab merchants, thereby severing the south's last economic contacts with the north. The colonial administration also discouraged the spread of Islam, the practice of Arab customs, and the wearing of Arab dress. At the same time, the British made efforts to revitalize African customs and tribal life that the slave trade had disrupted. Finally, a 1930 directive stated that blacks in the southern provinces were to be considered a people distinct from northern Muslims and that the region should be prepared for eventual integration with [[British East Africa]]. \n\nAlthough potentially a rich agricultural zone, the south's economic development suffered because of the region's isolation. Moreover, a continual struggle went on between British officials in the north and south, as those in the former resisted recommendations that northern resources be diverted to spur southern economic development. Personality clashes between officials in the two branches in the Sudan Political Service also impeded the south's growth. \n\nThose individuals who served in the southern provinces tended to be military officers with previous Africa experience on secondment to the colonial service. They usually were distrustful of Arab influence and were committed to keeping the south under British control. By contrast, officials in the northern provinces tended to be Arabists often drawn from the diplomatic and consular service. Whereas northern provincial governors conferred regularly as a group with the governor general in Khartoum, their three southern colleagues met to coordinate activities with the governors of the British East African colonies.\n\n==Rise of Sudanese nationalism==\n\nSudanese [[nationalism]], as it developed after World War I, was an Arab and Muslim phenomenon with its support base in the northern provinces. Nationalists opposed indirect rule and advocated a centralized national government in Khartoum responsible for both regions. Nationalists also perceived Britain's southern policy as artificially dividing Sudan and preventing its unification under an arabized and Islamic ruling class. \n\nIronically, however, a non-Arab led Sudan's first modern nationalist movement. In 1921, [[Ali Abd al Latif]], a Muslim [[Dinka]] and former army officer, founded the [[United Tribes Society]] that called for an independent Sudan in which power would be shared by tribal and religious leaders. Three years later, Ali Abd al Latif's movement, reconstituted as the [[White Flag League]], organized demonstrations in Khartoum that took advantage of the unrest that followed Stack's assassination. Ali Abd al Latif's arrest and subsequent exile in Egypt sparked a mutiny by a Sudanese army battalion, the suppression of which succeeded in temporarily crippling the nationalist movement. \n\nIn the 1930s, nationalism reemerged in Sudan. Educated Sudanese wanted to restrict the governor general's power and to obtain Sudanese participation in the council's deliberations. However, any change in government required a change in the co-dominium agreement. Neither Britain nor Egypt would agree to a modification. Moreover, the British regarded their role as the protection of the Sudanese from Egyptian domination. The nationalists feared that the eventual result of friction between the co-dominium powers might be the attachment of northern Sudan to Egypt and southern Sudan to Uganda and Kenya. Although they settled most of their differences in the 1936 [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Treaty of Alliance]], which set a timetable for the end of British military occupation, Britain and Egypt failed to agree on Sudan's future status. \n\nNationalists and religious leaders were divided on the issue of whether Sudan should apply for independence or for union with Egypt. The Mahdi's son, [[Abd ar Rahman al Mahdi]], emerged as a spokesman for independence in opposition to [[Ali al Mirghani]], the Khatmiyyah leader, who favored union with Egypt. Coalitions supported by each of these leaders formed rival wings of the nationalist movement. Later, radical nationalists and the Khatmiyyah created the [[Ashigga]], later renamed the [[National Unionist Party]] (NUP), to advance the cause of Sudanese-Egyptian unification. The moderates favored Sudanese independence in cooperation with Britain and together with the Ansar established the [[National Umma Party Sudan|Umma Party]].\n\n==The road to independence==\nAs World War II approached, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] assumed the mission of guarding the Sudanese frontier with [[Italian East Africa]] (present-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]). During the summer of 1940, in what became the first moves of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Italian forces invaded the Sudan at several points and captured the railway junction at [[Kassala]] and other villages along the border. However, while [[Port Sudan]] was raided by irregular Eritrean forces in August 1940, the SDF prevented an Italian advance on the [[Red Sea]] port city. \n\nIn January 1941, the SDF, expanded to about 20,000 troops, retook Kassala and participated in the Empire offensive that routed the Italians in Eritrea and liberated Ethiopia by the end of the year. Some Sudanese units later contributed to the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s successful [[North African Campaign]]. \n\nIn the immediate postwar years, the co-dominium government made a number of significant changes. In 1942 the [[Graduates' General Conference]], a quasi-nationalist movement formed by educated Sudanese, presented the government with a memorandum that demanded a pledge of self-determination after the war to be preceded by abolition of the \"closed door\" ordinances, an end to the separate curriculum in southern schools, and an increase in the number of Sudanese in the civil service. The governor general refused to accept the memorandum but agreed to a government-supervised transformation of indirect rule into a modernized system of local government. Sir [[Douglas Newbold]], governor of [[Kurdufan Province]] in the 1930s and later the executive council's civil secretary, advised the establishment of parliamentary government and the administrative unification of north and south. In 1948, over Egyptian objections, Britain authorized the partially elected consultative Legislative Assembly representing both regions to supersede the advisory executive council. The Legislative Assembly had its own executive council consisting of five British and seven Sudanese members.<ref name = SudanStory/>  A number of elected local government bodies gradually took over the responsibilities of the former British local commissioner, starting with [[El Obeid]], the centre of the [[Gum arabic]] industry.  By 1952 it was reported that Sudan had 56 local self-governing authorities.<ref name = SudanStory/>\n\nThe pro-Egyptian NUP boycotted the 1948 Legislative Assembly elections. As a result, pro-independence groups dominated the Legislative Assembly. In 1952, leaders of the Umma-dominated legislature negotiated the Self-Determination Agreement with Britain. The legislators then enacted a constitution that provided for a prime minister and council of ministers responsible to a bicameral parliament. The new Sudanese government would have responsibility in all areas except military and foreign affairs, which remained in the British governor general's hands. Cairo, which demanded recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan, repudiated the co-dominium agreement in protest and declared its reigning monarch, [[Faruk]], king of Sudan. \n\nAfter seizing power in Egypt and overthrowing the Faruk monarchy in late 1952, Colonel [[Muhammad Naguib]] broke the deadlock on the problem of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Cairo previously had linked discussions on Sudan's status to an agreement on the evacuation of British troops from the [[Suez Canal]]. Naguib separated the two issues and accepted the right of Sudanese self-determination. In February 1953, London and Cairo signed an Anglo-Egyptian accord, which allowed for a three-year transition period from co-dominium rule to self-government. During the transition phase, British troops would withdraw from Sudan. At the end of this period, the Sudanese would decide their future status in a plebiscite conducted under international supervision. Naguib's concession seemed justified when parliamentary elections held at the end of 1952 gave a majority to the pro-Egyptian NUP, which had called for an eventual union with Egypt. In January 1954, a new government emerged under NUP leader [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\n==The south and the unity of Sudan==\n\nDuring World War II, some British colonial officers questioned the economic and political viability of the southern provinces as separate from northern Sudan. Britain also had become more sensitive to Arab criticism of the southern policy. In 1946, the [[Sudan Administrative Conference]] determined that Sudan should be administered as one country. Moreover, the conference delegates agreed to readmit northern administrators to southern posts, abolish the trade restrictions imposed under the \"closed door\" ordinances, and allow southerners to seek employment in the north. Khartoum also nullified the prohibition against Muslim proselytizing in the south and introduced Arabic in the south as the official administration language. \n\nSome southern British colonial officials responded to the Sudan Administrative Conference by charging that northern agitation had influenced the conferees and that no voice had been heard at the conference in support of retaining the separate development policy. These British officers argued that northern domination of the south would result in a southern rebellion against the government. Khartoum therefore convened a [[Juba Conference (1947)|conference at Juba]] to allay the fears of southern leaders and British officials in the south and to assure them that a post-independence government would safeguard southern political and cultural rights. \n\nDespite these promises, an increasing number of southerners expressed concern that northerners would overwhelm them. In particular, they resented the imposition of Arabic as the official language of administration, which deprived most of the few educated English-speaking southerners of the opportunity to enter public service. They also felt threatened by the replacement of trusted British district commissioners with unsympathetic northerners. After the government replaced several hundred colonial officials with Sudanese, only four of whom were southerners, the southern elite abandoned hope of a peaceful, unified, independent Sudan. \n\nThe hostility of southerners toward the northern Arab majority surfaced violently when southern army units mutinied in August 1955 to protest their transfer to garrisons under northern officers. The rebellious troops killed several hundred northerners, including government officials, army officers, and merchants. The government quickly suppressed the revolt and eventually executed seventy southerners for sedition. But this harsh reaction failed to pacify the south, as some of the mutineers escaped to remote areas and organized resistance to the Arab-dominated government of Sudan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Sudan]]\n*[[Sudan\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{loc}} &ndash; [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/sdtoc.html Sudan]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/54131/life-visits-sudan-in-1947#index/0 LIFE Visits Sudan in 1947 ] - slideshow by ''[[Life magazine]]''\n* [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=7&CATID=-1714296 National Archives ] - Anglo-Egyptian Agreement\n* {{cite web |publisher=[[Durham University]] Library |location=UK |title=Sudan Archive |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=135 |quote=The Sudan Archive was founded in 1957, the year after Sudanese independence, to collect and preserve the papers of administrators from the Sudan Political Service, missionaries, soldiers, business men, doctors, agriculturalists, teachers and others who had served or lived in the Sudan during the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium |access-date=2014-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112622/https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=135 |archive-date=2015-09-10 |url-status=dead }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}\n[[Category:History of Sudan]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]\n[[Category:History of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Egypt\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Sudan}}\nThis article discusses the '''history''' of '''[[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]''' during the [[history of Sudan]] from 1899 to 1955. \n\nIn January 1899, an [[British Empire|Anglo]]-[[Egypt]]ian agreement restored Egyptian rule in [[Sudan]] but as part of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], or joint authority, exercised by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Egypt]].

This Advisory Council had 18 members representing Province Councils, 10 members nominated by the Governor-General and 2 honorary  members.<ref name = Almanac>Public Relations Department Sudan Government Khartoum  (1951) \u201cSudan Almanac 1951\u201d, McCorquodale & Co. (Sudan)</ref> The executive council retained legislative authority until 1948. \n\n===Law and order===\nAfter restoring order and the government's authority, the British dedicated themselves to creating a modern government in the condominium. Jurists adopted penal and criminal procedural codes similar to those in force in [[British Raj| British India]]. Commissions established land tenure rules and adjusted claims in dispute because of grants made by successive governments. Taxes on land remained the basic form of [[taxation]], the amount assessed depending on the type of [[irrigation]], the number of date palms, and the size of herds; however, the rate of taxation was fixed for the first time in Sudan's history. \n\nThe 1902 [[Code of Civil Procedure]] continued the [[Ottoman Law| Ottoman]] separation of civil law and [[sharia]], but it also created guidelines for the operation of sharia courts as an autonomous judicial division under a chief [[qadi]] appointed by the governor general. Religious judges and other sharia court officials were invariably Egyptian. \n\nThere was little resistance to the condominium. Breaches of the peace usually took the form of intertribal warfare or banditry. [[Mahdi]]st uprisings occurred in February 1900, in 1902-3, in 1904, and in 1908 but these revolts were of short duration. In 1916, [[Abd Allah as Suhayni]], who claimed to be the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]], launched an unsuccessful [[jihad]].\n\n===Undefined borders===\nThe problem of the condominium's undefined borders was a greater concern. A 1902 treaty with [[Ethiopia]] fixed the southeastern boundary with Sudan. Seven years later, an Anglo-[[Belgium|Belgian]] treaty determined the status of the [[Lado Enclave]] in the south establishing a border with the [[Belgian Congo]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). \n\nThe western boundary proved more difficult to resolve. [[Darfur]] was the only province formerly under Egyptian control that was not soon recovered under the condominium. When the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdiyah]] disintegrated, Sultan [[Ali Dinar]] reclaimed Darfur's throne, which had been lost to the Egyptians in 1874 and held the throne under Ottoman suzerainty, with British approval on condition that he pay annual tribute to the khedive. When World War I broke out, Ali Dinar proclaimed his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and responded to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]'s call for a jihad against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Britain, which had declared a protectorate over Egypt in 1914, sent a small force against Ali Dinar, who died in subsequent fighting. In 1916, the British annexed Darfur to Sudan and terminated the Fur sultanate.\n\n===Economic development===\nDuring the co-dominium period, economic development occurred only in the [[Nile Valley]]'s settled areas. In the first two decades of condominium rule, the British extended telegraph and rail lines to link key points in northern Sudan but services did not reach more remote areas. Port Sudan opened in 1906, replacing [[Sawakin]] as the country's principal outlet to the sea. \n\nIn 1911 the Sudanese government and the private Sudan Plantations Syndicate launched the [[Gezira Scheme]] (Gezira is also seen as Jazirah) to provide a source of high-quality cotton for Britain's textile industry. An irrigation [[Sennar Dam|dam near Sennar]], completed in 1925, brought a much larger area in [[Al Jazirah (state)|Al Jazirah]] under cultivation. Planters sent cotton by rail from Sannar to Port Sudan for shipment abroad. The Gezira Scheme made cotton the mainstay of the country's economy and turned the region into Sudan's most densely populated area.\n\n==Egyptian independence, fate of Sudan==\n\nIn 1922, Britain renounced the protectorate and approved [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|Egypt's declaration of independence]]. However, the 1923 Egyptian constitution made no claim to Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Subsequent negotiations in London between the British and the new Egyptian government foundered on the Sudan question. \n\nInflamed by the failure of the talks, nationalists rioted in Egypt and in Sudan where [[Ali Abd al Latif| a minority supported union]] with Egypt. In November 1924, Sir [[Lee Stack]], governor general of Sudan and Sirdar, was assassinated in Cairo. Britain ordered all Egyptian troops, civil servants, and public employees withdrawn from Sudan. In 1925, Khartoum formed the 4,500-man [[Sudan Defence Force]] (SDF) under Sudanese officers to replace Egyptian units.\n\n===Indirect rule===\nSudan was relatively quiet in the late 1920s and 1930s. During this period, the colonial government favored [[indirect rule]], which allowed the British to govern through indigenous leaders. \n\nIn Sudan, the traditional leaders were the shaykhs (of villages, tribes, and districts) in the north and tribal chiefs in the south. The British first delegated judicial powers to shaykhs to enable them to settle local disputes; then, gradually, they allowed the shaykhs to administer local government under the supervision of British district commissioners. The number of Sudanese recognizing these leaders and the degree of authority they wielded varied considerably. \n\nThe mainstream of political development, represented by other local leaders and Khartoum's educated elite, disapproved of indirect rule. In their view, it prevented the country's unification, exacerbated tribalism in the north, and in the south served to buttress a less-advanced society against Arab influence. Indirect rule also implied government decentralization, which alarmed the educated elite who had careers in the central administration and envisioned an eventual transfer of power from British colonial authorities to their class.\n\nNationalists and the [[Khatmiyyah]] opposed indirect rule, but the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (or followers of the Mahdi) supported the British approach since many of them enjoyed positions of local authority.\n\n==Britain's policy towards the South==\n\nFrom the beginning of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, the British sought to modernize Sudan by applying European technology to its underdeveloped economy and by replacing its authoritarian institutions with ones that adhered to liberal English traditions. \n\nSouthern Sudan's remote and undeveloped provinces&mdash;Equatoria, [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]], and Upper Nile&mdash;received little official attention until after World War I, however, except for efforts to suppress tribal warfare and the slave trade. The British justified this policy by claiming that the south was not ready for exposure to the modern world. To allow the south to develop along indigenous lines, the British, therefore, closed the region to outsiders. As a result, the south remained isolated. A few Arab merchants controlled the region's limited commercial activities while Arab bureaucrats administered whatever laws existed. Christian missionaries, who operated schools and medical clinics, provided limited social services in southern Sudan. \n\nThe earliest Christian missionaries were the [[Verona]] Fathers, a [[Roman Catholic]] religious order that had established southern missions before the Mahdiyah. Other missionary groups active in the south included [[Presbyterian]]s from the United States and the Anglican [[Church Missionary Society]]. There was no competition among these missions, largely because they maintained separate areas of influence. The government eventually subsidized the mission schools that educated southerners. Because mission graduates usually succeeded in gaining posts in the provincial civil service, many northerners regarded them as tools of British imperialism. The few southerners who received higher training attended schools in British East Africa (present-day [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) rather than in Khartoum, thereby exacerbating the north-south division. \n\n===\"Closed-door\" ordinances===\nBritish authorities treated the three southern provinces as a separate region. The colonial administration, as it consolidated its southern position in the 1920s, detached the south from the rest of Sudan for all practical purposes. \n\nThe period's \"closed door\" ordinances, which barred northern Sudanese from entering or working in the south, reinforced this separate development policy. Moreover, the British gradually replaced Arab administrators and expelled Arab merchants, thereby severing the south's last economic contacts with the north. The colonial administration also discouraged the spread of Islam, the practice of Arab customs, and the wearing of Arab dress. At the same time, the British made efforts to revitalize African customs and tribal life that the slave trade had disrupted. Finally, a 1930 directive stated that blacks in the southern provinces were to be considered a people distinct from northern Muslims and that the region should be prepared for eventual integration with [[British East Africa]]. \n\nAlthough potentially a rich agricultural zone, the south's economic development suffered because of the region's isolation. Moreover, a continual struggle went on between British officials in the north and south, as those in the former resisted recommendations that northern resources be diverted to spur southern economic development. Personality clashes between officials in the two branches in the Sudan Political Service also impeded the south's growth. \n\nThose individuals who served in the southern provinces tended to be military officers with previous Africa experience on secondment to the colonial service. They usually were distrustful of Arab influence and were committed to keeping the south under British control. By contrast, officials in the northern provinces tended to be Arabists often drawn from the diplomatic and consular service. Whereas northern provincial governors conferred regularly as a group with the governor general in Khartoum, their three southern colleagues met to coordinate activities with the governors of the British East African colonies.\n\n==Rise of Sudanese nationalism==\n\nSudanese [[nationalism]], as it developed after World War I, was an Arab and Muslim phenomenon with its support base in the northern provinces. Nationalists opposed indirect rule and advocated a centralized national government in Khartoum responsible for both regions. Nationalists also perceived Britain's southern policy as artificially dividing Sudan and preventing its unification under an arabized and Islamic ruling class. \n\nIronically, however, a non-Arab led Sudan's first modern nationalist movement. In 1921, [[Ali Abd al Latif]], a Muslim [[Dinka]] and former army officer, founded the [[United Tribes Society]] that called for an independent Sudan in which power would be shared by tribal and religious leaders. Three years later, Ali Abd al Latif's movement, reconstituted as the [[White Flag League]], organized demonstrations in Khartoum that took advantage of the unrest that followed Stack's assassination. Ali Abd al Latif's arrest and subsequent exile in Egypt sparked a mutiny by a Sudanese army battalion, the suppression of which succeeded in temporarily crippling the nationalist movement. \n\nIn the 1930s, nationalism reemerged in Sudan. Educated Sudanese wanted to restrict the governor general's power and to obtain Sudanese participation in the council's deliberations. However, any change in government required a change in the co-dominium agreement. Neither Britain nor Egypt would agree to a modification. Moreover, the British regarded their role as the protection of the Sudanese from Egyptian domination. The nationalists feared that the eventual result of friction between the co-dominium powers might be the attachment of northern Sudan to Egypt and southern Sudan to Uganda and Kenya. Although they settled most of their differences in the 1936 [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Treaty of Alliance]], which set a timetable for the end of British military occupation, Britain and Egypt failed to agree on Sudan's future status. \n\nNationalists and religious leaders were divided on the issue of whether Sudan should apply for independence or for union with Egypt. The Mahdi's son, [[Abd ar Rahman al Mahdi]], emerged as a spokesman for independence in opposition to [[Ali al Mirghani]], the Khatmiyyah leader, who favored union with Egypt. Coalitions supported by each of these leaders formed rival wings of the nationalist movement. Later, radical nationalists and the Khatmiyyah created the [[Ashigga]], later renamed the [[National Unionist Party]] (NUP), to advance the cause of Sudanese-Egyptian unification. The moderates favored Sudanese independence in cooperation with Britain and together with the Ansar established the [[National Umma Party Sudan|Umma Party]].\n\n==The road to independence==\nAs World War II approached, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] assumed the mission of guarding the Sudanese frontier with [[Italian East Africa]] (present-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]). During the summer of 1940, in what became the first moves of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Italian forces invaded the Sudan at several points and captured the railway junction at [[Kassala]] and other villages along the border. However, while [[Port Sudan]] was raided by irregular Eritrean forces in August 1940, the SDF prevented an Italian advance on the [[Red Sea]] port city. \n\nIn January 1941, the SDF, expanded to about 20,000 troops, retook Kassala and participated in the Empire offensive that routed the Italians in Eritrea and liberated Ethiopia by the end of the year. Some Sudanese units later contributed to the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s successful [[North African Campaign]]. \n\nIn the immediate postwar years, the co-dominium government made a number of significant changes. In 1942 the [[Graduates' General Conference]], a quasi-nationalist movement formed by educated Sudanese, presented the government with a memorandum that demanded a pledge of self-determination after the war to be preceded by abolition of the \"closed door\" ordinances, an end to the separate curriculum in southern schools, and an increase in the number of Sudanese in the civil service. The governor general refused to accept the memorandum but agreed to a government-supervised transformation of indirect rule into a modernized system of local government. Sir [[Douglas Newbold]], governor of [[Kurdufan Province]] in the 1930s and later the executive council's civil secretary, advised the establishment of parliamentary government and the administrative unification of north and south. In 1948, over Egyptian objections, Britain authorized the partially elected consultative Legislative Assembly representing both regions to supersede the advisory executive council. The Legislative Assembly had its own executive council consisting of five British and seven Sudanese members.<ref name = SudanStory/>  A number of elected local government bodies gradually took over the responsibilities of the former British local commissioner, starting with [[El Obeid]], the centre of the [[Gum arabic]] industry.  By 1952 it was reported that Sudan had 56 local self-governing authorities.<ref name = SudanStory/>\n\nThe pro-Egyptian NUP boycotted the 1948 Legislative Assembly elections. As a result, pro-independence groups dominated the Legislative Assembly. In 1952, leaders of the Umma-dominated legislature negotiated the Self-Determination Agreement with Britain. The legislators then enacted a constitution that provided for a prime minister and council of ministers responsible to a bicameral parliament. The new Sudanese government would have responsibility in all areas except military and foreign affairs, which remained in the British governor general's hands. Cairo, which demanded recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan, repudiated the co-dominium agreement in protest and declared its reigning monarch, [[Faruk]], king of Sudan. \n\nAfter seizing power in Egypt and overthrowing the Faruk monarchy in late 1952, Colonel [[Muhammad Naguib]] broke the deadlock on the problem of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Cairo previously had linked discussions on Sudan's status to an agreement on the evacuation of British troops from the [[Suez Canal]]. Naguib separated the two issues and accepted the right of Sudanese self-determination. In February 1953, London and Cairo signed an Anglo-Egyptian accord, which allowed for a three-year transition period from co-dominium rule to self-government. During the transition phase, British troops would withdraw from Sudan. At the end of this period, the Sudanese would decide their future status in a plebiscite conducted under international supervision. Naguib's concession seemed justified when parliamentary elections held at the end of 1952 gave a majority to the pro-Egyptian NUP, which had called for an eventual union with Egypt. In January 1954, a new government emerged under NUP leader [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\n==The south and the unity of Sudan==\n\nDuring World War II, some British colonial officers questioned the economic and political viability of the southern provinces as separate from northern Sudan. Britain also had become more sensitive to Arab criticism of the southern policy. In 1946, the [[Sudan Administrative Conference]] determined that Sudan should be administered as one country. Moreover, the conference delegates agreed to readmit northern administrators to southern posts, abolish the trade restrictions imposed under the \"closed door\" ordinances, and allow southerners to seek employment in the north. Khartoum also nullified the prohibition against Muslim proselytizing in the south and introduced Arabic in the south as the official administration language. \n\nSome southern British colonial officials responded to the Sudan Administrative Conference by charging that northern agitation had influenced the conferees and that no voice had been heard at the conference in support of retaining the separate development policy. These British officers argued that northern domination of the south would result in a southern rebellion against the government. Khartoum therefore convened a [[Juba Conference (1947)|conference at Juba]] to allay the fears of southern leaders and British officials in the south and to assure them that a post-independence government would safeguard southern political and cultural rights. \n\nDespite these promises, an increasing number of southerners expressed concern that northerners would overwhelm them. In particular, they resented the imposition of Arabic as the official language of administration, which deprived most of the few educated English-speaking southerners of the opportunity to enter public service. They also felt threatened by the replacement of trusted British district commissioners with unsympathetic northerners. After the government replaced several hundred colonial officials with Sudanese, only four of whom were southerners, the southern elite abandoned hope of a peaceful, unified, independent Sudan. \n\nThe hostility of southerners toward the northern Arab majority surfaced violently when southern army units mutinied in August 1955 to protest their transfer to garrisons under northern officers. The rebellious troops killed several hundred northerners, including government officials, army officers, and merchants. The government quickly suppressed the revolt and eventually executed seventy southerners for sedition. But this harsh reaction failed to pacify the south, as some of the mutineers escaped to remote areas and organized resistance to the Arab-dominated government of Sudan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Sudan]]\n*[[Sudan\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{loc}} &ndash; [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/sdtoc.html Sudan]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/54131/life-visits-sudan-in-1947#index/0 LIFE Visits Sudan in 1947 ] - slideshow by ''[[Life magazine]]''\n* [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=7&CATID=-1714296 National Archives ] - Anglo-Egyptian Agreement\n* {{cite web |publisher=[[Durham University]] Library |location=UK |title=Sudan Archive |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=135 |quote=The Sudan Archive was founded in 1957, the year after Sudanese independence, to collect and preserve the papers of administrators from the Sudan Political Service, missionaries, soldiers, business men, doctors, agriculturalists, teachers and others who had served or lived in the Sudan during the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium |access-date=2014-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112622/https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=135 |archive-date=2015-09-10 |url-status=dead }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}\n[[Category:History of Sudan]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]\n[[Category:History of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Egypt\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: north-south \u2192 north\u2013south, 1902-3 \u2192 1902\u20133", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Anglo-Egyptian_Sudan"}

For example: the [[cognitive-experiential self-theory]] (CEST) also is an adaptive view of heuristic processing. CEST breaks down two systems that process information. At some times, roughly speaking, individuals consider issues rationally, systematically, logically, deliberately, effortfully, and verbally.

Can also be considered the gut decision since if the gut feeling is right, then the benefits are high and the risks are low.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Slovic|first=Paul|last2=Finucane|first2=Melissa L.|last3=Peters|first3=Ellen|last4=MacGregor|first4=Donald G.|date=2007-03|title=The affect heuristic|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2005.04.006|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=177|issue=3|pages=1333\u20131352|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2005.04.006|issn=0377-2217}}</ref>\n*[[Anchoring and adjustment]] \u2013 Describes the common human tendency to rely more heavily on the first piece of information offered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions.  For example, in a study done with children, the children were told to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar.  Groups of children were given either a high or low \"base\" number (anchor).  Children estimated the number of jellybeans to be closer to the anchor number that they were given.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, H.|year=1999|title=Use of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic by children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226776426|journal=Current Psychology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=294\u2013300|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1004-4}}</ref>\n*[[Availability heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut that occurs when people make judgments about the probability of events by the ease with which examples come to mind.

This leads people to avoid others that are viewed as \u201ccontaminated\u201d to the observer. This happens due     to the fact of the observer viewing something that is seen as bad or to seek objects that have been associate with what seems good. Somethings one can view as harmful can tend not to really be. This sometimes leads to irrational thinking on behalf of the observer. \n*[[Effort heuristic]] -  the worth of an object is determined by the amount of effort put into the production of the object. Objects that took longer to produce are more  valuable while the objects that took less time are deemed not as valuable. Also applies to how much effort is put into achieving the product. This can be seen as the difference of working and earning the object versus  finding the object on the side of the street. It can be the same object but the one found will not be deemed as valuable as the one that we earned. \n*[[Escalation of commitment]] \u2013 Describes the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit. This is related to the [[sunk cost]] fallacy.\n*[[Familiarity heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut applied to various situations in which individuals assume that the circumstances underlying the past behavior still hold true for the present situation and that the past behavior thus can be correctly applied to the new situation.

Usually not every event is seen as complete but what was felt at the     climax whether the event was pleasant or unpleasant to the observer.\u00a0 All other feelings is not lost but is not used. This can also include how long the event happened. \n*[[Representativeness heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut used when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty.   Or, judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind. For example, in a 1982 Tversky and Kahneman experiment, participants were given a description of a woman named Linda.  Based on the description, it was likely that Linda was a feminist.  Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.  The likelihood of two events cannot be greater than that of either of the two events individually. For this reason, the representativeness heuristic is exemplary of the [[conjunction fallacy]].<ref name=\"Harvey, N. 2007\"/>\n*[[Scarcity heuristic]] - works as the same as the economy. The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has. In many situations we use an item\u2019s availability, its perceived abundance, to quickly estimate quality and/or utility. This can lead to systemic errors or [[cognitive bias]].\n*[[Simulation heuristic]]\n*[[Social proof]]\n\n=== Formal models of heuristics ===\n\n*[[Fast-and-frugal trees]]\n*[[Fluency heuristic]]\n*[[Gaze heuristic]]\n*[[Recognition heuristic]]\n*[[Satisficing]]\n*[[Similarity heuristic]]\n*[[Take-the-best heuristic]]\n\n=== Cognitive maps ===\nHeuristics were also found to be used in the manipulation and creation of [[cognitive maps]]. Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

Wimsatt]], and others.)\n\n== Law ==\nIn [[legal theory]], especially in the theory of [[law and economics]], heuristics are used in the [[law]] when [[case method|case-by-case analysis]] would be impractical, insofar as \"practicality\" is defined by the interests of a governing body.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer and Christoph Engel, eds. (2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions)<ref name=\":0\" />, to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space.

For example: the [[cognitive-experiential self-theory]] (CEST) also is an adaptive view of heuristic processing. CEST breaks down two systems that process information. At some times, roughly speaking, individuals consider issues rationally, systematically, logically, deliberately, effortfully, and verbally. On other occasions, individuals consider issues intuitively, effortlessly, globally, and emotionally.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=53 |title=Cognitive experiential self theory - Psychlopedia |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201338 |doi=10.1177/1745691611429354 |pmid=26168420 |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |last1=De Neys |first1=Wim |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731094145/http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=53 |archive-date=2013-07-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From this perspective, heuristics are part of a larger experiential processing system that is often adaptive, but vulnerable to error in situations that require logical analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = S. | last2 = Pacini | first2 = R. | last3 = Denes-Raj | first3 = V. | last4 = Heier | first4 = H. | year = 1996 | title = Individual differences in intuitive-experiential and analytical-rational thinking styles | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 390\u2013405 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.390 | pmid=8765488}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Daniel Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called ''[[attribute substitution]]'', which happens without conscious awareness.<ref name=\"revisited\">{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Shane Frederick|title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2002|pages=49\u201381|chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment|isbn=978-0-521-79679-8|oclc=47364085}}</ref> According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgment (of a \"target attribute\") that is computationally complex, a rather easier calculated \"heuristic attribute\" is substituted.

Emotion is the affect that plays the lead role that makes the decision or solve the problem quickly or efficiently. Is used while judging the risks and benefits of something, depending on the positive or negative feelings that people associate with a stimulus. Can also be considered the gut decision since if the gut feeling is right, then the benefits are high and the risks are low. \n*[[Anchoring and adjustment]] \u2013 Describes the common human tendency to rely more heavily on the first piece of information offered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions.  For example, in a study done with children, the children were told to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar.  Groups of children were given either a high or low \"base\" number (anchor).  Children estimated the number of jellybeans to be closer to the anchor number that they were given.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, H.|year=1999|title=Use of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic by children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226776426|journal=Current Psychology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=294\u2013300|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1004-4}}</ref>\n*[[Availability heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut that occurs when people make judgments about the probability of events by the ease with which examples come to mind.  For example, in a 1973 Tversky & Kahneman experiment, the majority of participants reported that there were more words in the English language that start with the letter K than for which K was the third letter.  There are actually twice as many words in the English Language that have K as the third letter as those that start with K, but words that start with K are much easier to recall and bring to mind.<ref name=\"Harvey, N. 2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=N|year=2007|title=Use of heuristics: Insights from forecasting research|url=|journal=Thinking & Reasoning|volume=13|issue=1|pages=5\u201324|doi=10.1080/13546780600872502}}</ref>\n*[[Contagion heuristic]] \u2013 follows the Law of Contagion or Similarity. This leads people to avoid others that are viewed as \u201ccontaminated\u201d to the observer. This happens due     to the fact of the observer viewing something that is seen as bad or to seek objects that have been associate with what seems good. Somethings one can view as harmful can tend not to really be. This sometimes leads to irrational thinking on behalf of the observer. \n*[[Effort heuristic]] -  the worth of an object is determined by the amount of effort put into the production of the object. Objects that took longer to produce are more  valuable while the objects that took less time are deemed not as valuable. Also applies to how much effort is put into achieving the product. This can be seen as the difference of working and earning the object versus  finding the object on the side of the street. It can be the same object but the one found will not be deemed as valuable as the one that we earned. \n*[[Escalation of commitment]] \u2013 Describes the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit. This is related to the [[sunk cost]] fallacy.\n*[[Familiarity heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut applied to various situations in which individuals assume that the circumstances underlying the past behavior still hold true for the present situation and that the past behavior thus can be correctly applied to the new situation. Especially prevalent when the individual experiences a high [[cognitive load]].\n*[[Na\u00efve diversification]] \u2013 When asked to make several choices at once, people tend to diversify more than when making the same type of decision sequentially.\n*[[Peak\u2013end rule]] -  experience of an event is judged by the feelings of the peak of the event and nothing more. Usually not every event is seen as complete but what was felt at the     climax whether the event was pleasant or unpleasant to the observer.\u00a0 All other feelings is not lost but is not used. This can also include how long the event happened. \n*[[Representativeness heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut used when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty.   Or, judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind. For example, in a 1982 Tversky and Kahneman experiment, participants were given a description of a woman named Linda.  Based on the description, it was likely that Linda was a feminist.  Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.  The likelihood of two events cannot be greater than that of either of the two events individually. For this reason, the representativeness heuristic is exemplary of the [[conjunction fallacy]].<ref name=\"Harvey, N. 2007\"/>\n*[[Scarcity heuristic]] - works as the same as the economy. The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has. In many situations we use an item\u2019s availability, its perceived abundance, to quickly estimate quality and/or utility. This can lead to systemic errors or [[cognitive bias]].\n*[[Simulation heuristic]]\n*[[Social proof]]\n\n=== Formal models of heuristics ===\n\n*[[Fast-and-frugal trees]]\n*[[Fluency heuristic]]\n*[[Gaze heuristic]]\n*[[Recognition heuristic]]\n*[[Satisficing]]\n*[[Similarity heuristic]]\n*[[Take-the-best heuristic]]\n\n=== Cognitive maps ===\nHeuristics were also found to be used in the manipulation and creation of [[cognitive maps]]. Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

Wimsatt]], and others.)\n\n== Law ==\nIn [[legal theory]], especially in the theory of [[law and economics]], heuristics are used in the [[law]] when [[case method|case-by-case analysis]] would be impractical, insofar as \"practicality\" is defined by the interests of a governing body.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer and Christoph Engel, eds. (2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions)<ref name=\":0\" />, to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space.

In AD 60 the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island using his amphibious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[vanguard]] assault<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3\u20135.</ref> and then destroying the shrine and the [[nemeton|nemeta]] ([[sacred grove]]s). News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]], a fort in [[Holyhead]], are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a [[Roman roads|Roman road]].<ref>{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog |year=1910 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog/page/n337 18]}}</ref> The island was grouped by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] with [[Geography of Ireland|Ireland]] (\"[[Hibernia]]\") rather than with [[Great Britain|Britain]] (\"[[Albion]]\").<ref>{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 & 2 }}</ref>\n\n[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th-century [[antiquarian]] [[William Owen Stanley]].<ref>Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjects, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.</ref> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]]; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position, and so [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norwegian Empire]].\n\nAfter the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]] \u2014 some of these raids were noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]) \u2014 and by [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.\n\nAnglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the 13 [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''M\u00f4n'' often had periods of temporary independence, as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were a few years after 1171, following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]], when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]], and between 1246 and c. 1255, when it was granted to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. After the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Anglesey was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]], [[Rhosyr (cantref)|Rhosyr]] and [[Cemais (Anglesey cantref)|Cemaes]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Presbyterian minister and celebrity preacher John Williams toured the island as part of an effort to recruit young men to volunteer for a just war.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/anglesey-during-first-world-war-2036022 |title=Anglesey during the First World War and Second World War |last=Devine |first=Darren |date=2012-02-15 |work=walesonline |access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were kept on the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the end of the war, some 1,000 of the island's men had died while on active service.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1936 the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] opened its first branch on Anglesey.<ref>''A Years' Work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Annual Report for 1936-1937, adopted by the Council and Corporation, May 28, 1937'', London, p. 12.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Anglesey received Italian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The island was designated a reception zone, and was home to evacuee children from Liverpool and Manchester.<ref name=\":0\" /> The island's location made it an ideal place to monitor [[U-boat|German U-Boats]] operating in the [[Irish Sea]].

The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] abolished the 1974 county and the five districts on 1 April 1996. Anglesey became a separate [[unitary authority]]. In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Before the period of direct administration, there had been a majority of independent councillors. Though members did not generally divide along party lines, these were organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged since the election, although the Labour Party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.\n\nThe principal offices of the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]] ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Ynys M\u00f4n}}) are in [[Llangefni]] ({{IPA-cy|\u026can\u02c8\u0261\u025bvni}}), the [[county town]].<ref name=\"Academy\">{{Cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |author1-link=John Davies (historian) |last2=Jenkins |first2=Nigel |author2-link=Nigel Jenkins |last3=Baines |first3=Menna |last4=Llynch |first4=Peredur |year=2008 |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |location=Cardiff |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 |page=494}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Britannia Bridge Train crossing 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Britannia Bridge]] from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]\nAnglesey is a relatively low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are [[Holyhead Mountain]], {{convert|220|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd Bodafon]], {{convert|178|m|ft}}; [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]], {{convert|177|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd y Garn]], {{convert|170|m|ft}}; [[Bwrdd Arthur]], {{convert|164|m|ft}}; and Mynydd Llwydiarth, {{convert|158|m|ft}}. To the south and south-east, the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]]. At 714&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe, (although technically [[Madeira]] is part of Africa), and just five square kilometres smaller than [[Singapore]].\n\nThere are several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated. The largest are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'', in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound.\n\nNearby is the village with the longest name in Europe, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, and [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century by supporting an important [[copper]]-mining industry at [[Parys Mountain]].\n[[File:Penmon Lighthouse off Anglesey.jpg|thumb|[[Trwyn Du Lighthouse]]]]\n[[File:Anglesey Coast - geograph.org.uk - 1367265.jpg|thumb|Anglesey coast]]\n[[File:Menai Bridge - Anglesey August 2009 (3834581170).jpg|thumb|right|Menai Bridge]]\nOther villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look{{clarify|date=January 2019}} at local marine [[wildlife]] from [[Homarus gammarus|common lobsters]] to [[conger]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat]]. The zoo also breeds lobsters commercially for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (''Halen M\u00f4n'', evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.\n\nThere are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[Afon Cefni]].\n\nThe climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous [[Gwynedd]]) and generally equable, being influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive]] grove in Europe and presumably in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |date=30 April 2007 |work=WalesOnline}}</ref>\n\n==Coastal path==\nThe rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the economy, with local dairies being some of the most productive in the region.\n\nMajor industry is restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a copper mining town. Nearby is the site of the former [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. Plans were developed for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon Nuclear Power|Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news |title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms |author=Damian Carrington |work=the Guardian |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014</ref> and in January 2019 Hitachi announced it was putting development work on hold, which meant the plant's future was put in serious doubt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitachi's Wylfa nuclear project pause 'tremendous blow' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46902723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAnglesey also has three wind farms on land,<ref name=energy>[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and more than twenty offshore [[wind turbine]]s near the north coast.

The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment to about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the 22 Sqn Search and Rescue headquarters.\n\nThere is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly in industrial and business parks, especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]], [[fine chemical]] manufacturing, and factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is on one of the main road routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, serving [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.\n\n==Ecology and conservation==\nMuch of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are several important [[wetland]] sites that have protected status. In addition, the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years and died at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s, including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s, together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]]. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns \u2013 see [[Anglesey tern colonies]].\n\nThere are marked occurrences of the [[Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow|''Juncus subnodulosus''\u2013''Cirsium palustre'' fen-meadow]] [[plant association]], a [[habitat]] marked by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs.<ref>*C.

The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and confirmed as such in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.\n\nA number of the habitats in Anglesey gain still greater protection through both UK and European designations of their nature conservation value. These include:\n*6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)\n*4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)\n*1 National Nature Reserve\n*26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)\n*52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)\nThese habitats support a variety of wildlife, such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].\n\nThe AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:\n#North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n\nPopular recreations include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing. They place pressures and demands on the AONB, while contributing to the local economy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/index.htm |title=Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty |publisher=Pixaerial: North Wales from the Air |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218223715/http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/gallery.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2007 |language=English |access-date=February 21, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Abandoned nuclear plan==\nOn 17 January 2019, Hitachi-Horizon Nuclear Power announced it was abandoning plans to build a nuclear plant on the Wylfa Newydd site in Anglesey.

Anglesey's biggest successes were at the [[1997 Island Games]] held in [[Jersey]], (11th in the medals table, with two gold, three silver and nine bronze medals) and the [[2005 Island Games]] in the [[Shetland Islands]], (again 11th, with 4 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze).\n\nThe annual Anglesey Show is held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of August. Farmers from around the country compete in livestock rearing contests, including sheep and cattle.\n\nAnglesey has featured in the [[Channel 4]] archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' (series 14). The episode was transmitted on 4 February 2007.\n\nThe island hosts Gottwood, an electronic music and arts festival held each summer at the Carreglwyd estate. The Druidic college at Anglesey is referred to in the metal band [[Eluveitie]]'s song \"Inis Mona\", an incorrect spelling of Ynys M\u00f4n.\n\n[[Capital Cymru]], a commercial [[contemporary hit radio]] station, also covers [[Gwynedd]]. [[M\u00f4n FM]], a volunteer community radio station, broadcasts from the county town, Llangefni.\n\n==Welsh language==\nAnglesey is a stronghold of the [[Welsh language]] and according to the 2011 census it was the local authority with the second highest proportion of Welsh speakers.

Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[Precambrian]] rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:\n#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#a central area about [[Aberffraw]] and [[Trefdraeth]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#an eastern region which includes [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]],{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}} [[Gaerwen]] and [[Pentraeth]]\n#a coastal region at [[Menai Bridge#Glyn Garth|Glyn Garth]] between [[Menai Bridge]] and [[Beaumaris]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\nThese Precambrian rocks are [[schist]]s and [[phyllite]]s, often contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone. [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked. [[serpentine group|Serpentine]] (Mona Marble) is found near [[Llanfair-yn-Neubwll]] and upon the opposite shore in [[Holyhead]].{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n\nUnder the name ''[[GeoM\u00f4n]]'', in recognition of its extraordinary geological heritage, the island gained membership of the [[European Geoparks Network]] in spring 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geomon.co.uk/#/about/4533286655 |title=GeoM\u00f4n \u2013 Anglesey Geopark |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> and the [[Global Network of National Geoparks|Global Geoparks Network]] in September 2010.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:South Stack Lighthouse Anglesey.jpg|thumb|right|South Stack lighthouse]]\n*[[Anglesey Circuit|Anglesey Motor Racing Circuit]]\n*[[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] near [[Dwyran]]\n*Bays and beaches \u2013 [[Benllech]], [[Cemlyn Bay and lagoon|Cemlyn]], [[Red Wharf Bay|Red Wharf]], and [[Rhosneigr]]\n*[[Beaumaris Castle]] and [[Beaumaris Gaol|Gaol]]\n*[[Cribinau]] \u2013 tidal island with 13th-century church\n*[[Elin's Tower]] (Twr Elin) \u2013 RSPB reserve and the lighthouse at South Stack (Ynys Lawd) near [[Holyhead]]\n*[[King Arthur]]'s seat \u2013 near [[Beaumaris]]\n*[[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]], one of the longest place names in the world\n*[[Malltraeth]] \u2013 centre for bird life and home of wildlife artist [[Charles Tunnicliffe]]\n*[[Moelfre, Anglesey|Moelfre]] \u2013 fishing village\n*[[Parys Mountain]] \u2013 copper mine dating to the early Bronze Age\n*[[Penmon (place)|Penmon]] \u2013 priory and dovecote\n*[[The Skerries, Anglesey|Skerries]] [[Lighthouse]] \u2013 at the end of a low piece of submerged land, north-east of [[Holyhead]]\n*Stone Science Museum \u2013 privately run fossil museum near [[Pentraeth]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stonescience.co.uk/|title=Stone Science Museum - Fossils & Dinosaurs - Anglesey North Wales|author=|date=|website=Stone Science Museum Anglesey}}</ref>\n*Swtan longhouse and museum \u2013 owned by the [[National Trust]] and managed by the local community\n*Working [[windmill]] \u2013 [[Llanddeusant, Anglesey|Llanddeusant]]\n*[[Ynys Llanddwyn]] (Llanddwyn Island) \u2013 tidal island\n*[[St Cybi's Church]] Historic church in Holyhead\n\n==Notable people==\n===Born in Anglesey===\n*[[Tony Adams (actor)|Tony Adams]] \u2013 actor (Anglesey, 1940)\n*[[Stu Allan]] \u2013 radio and club DJ\n*[[John C.

[[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] is near one of 28 [[Dolmen|cromlechs]] that remain on uplands overlooking the sea.

In AD 60 the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island using his amphibious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[vanguard]] assault<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3\u20135.</ref> and then destroying the shrine and the [[nemeton|nemeta]] ([[sacred grove]]s). News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]], a fort in [[Holyhead]], are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a [[Roman roads|Roman road]].<ref>{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog |year=1910 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog/page/n337 18]}}</ref> The island was grouped by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] with [[Geography of Ireland|Ireland]] (\"[[Hibernia]]\") rather than with [[Great Britain|Britain]] (\"[[Albion]]\").<ref>{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 & 2 }}</ref>\n\n[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th-century [[antiquarian]] [[William Owen Stanley]].<ref>Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjects, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.</ref> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]]; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position, and so [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norwegian Empire]].\n\nAfter the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]] \u2014 some of these raids were noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]) \u2014 and by [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.\n\nAnglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the 13 [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''M\u00f4n'' often had periods of temporary independence, as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were a few years after 1171, following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]], when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]], and between 1246 and c. 1255, when it was granted to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. After the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Anglesey was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]], [[Rhosyr (cantref)|Rhosyr]] and [[Cemais (Anglesey cantref)|Cemaes]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Presbyterian minister and celebrity preacher John Williams toured the island as part of an effort to recruit young men to volunteer for a just war.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/anglesey-during-first-world-war-2036022 |title=Anglesey during the First World War and Second World War |last=Devine |first=Darren |date=2012-02-15 |work=walesonline |access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were kept on the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the end of the war, some 1,000 of the island's men had died while on active service.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1936 the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] opened its first branch on Anglesey.<ref>''A Years' Work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Annual Report for 1936-1937, adopted by the Council and Corporation, May 28, 1937'', London, p. 12.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Anglesey received Italian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The island was designated a reception zone, and was home to evacuee children from Liverpool and Manchester.<ref name=\":0\" /> The island's location made it an ideal place to monitor [[U-boat|German U-Boats]] operating in the [[Irish Sea]].

The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] abolished the 1974 county and the five districts on 1 April 1996. Anglesey became a separate [[unitary authority]]. In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Before the period of direct administration, there had been a majority of independent councillors. Though members did not generally divide along party lines, these were organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged since the election, although the Labour Party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.\n\nThe principal offices of the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]] ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Ynys M\u00f4n}}) are in [[Llangefni]] ({{IPA-cy|\u026can\u02c8\u0261\u025bvni}}), the [[county town]].<ref name=\"Academy\">{{Cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |author1-link=John Davies (historian) |last2=Jenkins |first2=Nigel |author2-link=Nigel Jenkins |last3=Baines |first3=Menna |last4=Llynch |first4=Peredur |year=2008 |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |location=Cardiff |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 |page=494}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Britannia Bridge Train crossing 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Britannia Bridge]] from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]\nAnglesey is a relatively low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are [[Holyhead Mountain]], {{convert|220|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd Bodafon]], {{convert|178|m|ft}}; [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]], {{convert|177|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd y Garn]], {{convert|170|m|ft}}; [[Bwrdd Arthur]], {{convert|164|m|ft}}; and Mynydd Llwydiarth, {{convert|158|m|ft}}. To the south and south-east, the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]]. At 714&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe, (although technically [[Madeira]] is part of Africa), and just five square kilometres smaller than [[Singapore]].\n\nThere are several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated. The largest are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'', in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound.\n\nNearby is the village with the longest name in Europe, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, and [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century by supporting an important [[copper]]-mining industry at [[Parys Mountain]].\n[[File:Penmon Lighthouse off Anglesey.jpg|thumb|[[Trwyn Du Lighthouse]]]]\n[[File:Anglesey Coast - geograph.org.uk - 1367265.jpg|thumb|Anglesey coast]]\n[[File:Menai Bridge - Anglesey August 2009 (3834581170).jpg|thumb|right|Menai Bridge]]\nOther villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look{{clarify|date=January 2019}} at local marine [[wildlife]] from [[Homarus gammarus|common lobsters]] to [[conger]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat]]. The zoo also breeds lobsters commercially for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (''Halen M\u00f4n'', evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.\n\nThere are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[Afon Cefni]].\n\nThe climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous [[Gwynedd]]) and generally equable, being influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive]] grove in Europe and presumably in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |date=30 April 2007 |work=WalesOnline}}</ref>\n\n==Coastal path==\nThe rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the economy, with local dairies being some of the most productive in the region.\n\nMajor industry is restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a copper mining town. Nearby is the site of the former [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. Plans were developed for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon Nuclear Power|Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news |title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms |author=Damian Carrington |work=the Guardian |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014</ref> and in January 2019 Hitachi announced it was putting development work on hold, which meant the plant's future was put in serious doubt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitachi's Wylfa nuclear project pause 'tremendous blow' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46902723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAnglesey also has three wind farms on land,<ref name=energy>[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and more than twenty offshore [[wind turbine]]s near the north coast.

The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment to about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the 22 Sqn Search and Rescue headquarters.\n\nThere is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly in industrial and business parks, especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]], [[fine chemical]] manufacturing, and factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is on one of the main road routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, serving [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.\n\n==Ecology and conservation==\nMuch of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are several important [[wetland]] sites that have protected status. In addition, the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years and died at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s, including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s, together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]].

The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and confirmed as such in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.\n\nA number of the habitats in Anglesey gain still greater protection through both UK and European designations of their nature conservation value. These include:\n*6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)\n*4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)\n*1 National Nature Reserve\n*26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)\n*52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)\nThese habitats support a variety of wildlife, such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].\n\nThe AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:\n#North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n\nPopular recreations include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing.

Farmers from around the country compete in livestock rearing contests, including sheep and cattle.\n\nAnglesey has featured in the [[Channel 4]] archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' (series 14). The episode was transmitted on 4 February 2007.\n\nThe island hosts Gottwood, an electronic music and arts festival held each summer at the Carreglwyd estate.

Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[Precambrian]] rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:\n#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#a central area about [[Aberffraw]] and [[Trefdraeth]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#an eastern region which includes [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]],{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}} [[Gaerwen]] and [[Pentraeth]]\n#a coastal region at [[Menai Bridge#Glyn Garth|Glyn Garth]] between [[Menai Bridge]] and [[Beaumaris]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\nThese Precambrian rocks are [[schist]]s and [[phyllite]]s, often contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone. [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked.

The team finished joint 17th in the [[2009 Island Games|2009 Games]] hosted by [[\u00c5land]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=NatWest Island Games XIII \u2013 Medal Table |url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> winning medals in [[gymnastics]], [[sailing (sport)|sailing]] and [[shooting]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=NatWest Island Games XIII \u2013 Ynys M\u00f4n Medal Winners |url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx?IslandID=22 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnglesey made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2009 games, led by Ynys M\u00f4n MP [[Albert Owen]]. The island expected to benefit from more than \u00a33m of spending if it had hosted the event. However, Anglesey currently lacks two facilities necessary for a successful bid, a six-lane competition swimming pool and an athletics track.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Clark |first=Rhodri |title=Out of the running for island 'Olympics' |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/02/out-of-the-running-for-island-olympics-91466-21452392/ |accessdate=30 August 2010 |newspaper=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nSeveral precursors to the modern football codes were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, at the turn of the 18th century, described a game in [[Llandrygan]] as ending with \"&#91;n&#93;umbers of players...  left here and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured.\" William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting \"as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale... having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily.\"{{sfnp |ETBRS |2005b}}\n\n===Association football===\nFootball arrived on the island in the 1870s. It was initially met with resistance, given its locally perceived associations with drunkenness and rowdiness, and the lower classes. One critic dismissed it as \"un-Christian practice\". The Anglesey League, comprising teams from [[Amlwch]], [[Beaumaris]], [[Holyhead]], [[Menai Bridge]], [[Llandegfan]], and [[Llangefni]], was, however, formed in the 1895\u20131896 football season.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}\n\nThe [[Anglesey football team|Ynys M\u00f4n]] football team represent the island of Anglesey at the biannual [[Island Games]], winning gold in 1999. In 2018, the island was chosen to host the [[2019 Inter Games Football Tournament]], where the men's team won gold and the women's team won silver.\n\nAs of the 2019-20 season, [[Llangefni Town F.C.|Llangefni Town]] play in the [[Cymru North]] league - at the second tier of the [[Welsh football league system]], after winning the [[Welsh Alliance League]] title the previous season.\n\nThere are seven Anglesey clubs playing in the Welsh Alliance, including [[Bodedern Athletic F.C.|Bodedern Athletic]] and [[Holyhead Hotspur F.C.|Holyhead Hotspur]] in Division One. Local clubs also participate in the [[Gwynedd League]] and the [[Anglesey League]].\n\n===Rugby Union===\n[[Llangefni RFC]] is the island's highest competing team in the [[WRU Division One North]].\n\n[[Llangoed]] hosts an annual [[rugby sevens]] contest. Touring sides have included Manhattan RFC.\n\n===Anglesey Hunt===\nThe Anglesey Hunt, formed in 1757, was the second oldest [[fox hunting]] association in Wales (the oldest being the Tivyside Hunt in Cardiganshire).{{sfnp|ETBRS|2005a}}\n\n===Athletics===\nEvery September the Anglesey Festival of Running takes place. It includes a marathon, a half-marathon, 10-km and 5\u2013km races, and children's contests. Its slogan is ''Run the Island''.\n\n===Motorsport===\nThe [[Anglesey Circuit]] (Welsh: Trac M\u00f4n) is a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit that opened in 1997.\n\n===Cricket===\nThe Beaumaris Cricket Club was formed in 1858. Clubs at [[Holyhead]], [[Amlwch]] and [[Llangefni]] were formed within the following decade, but it was not until the 1880s that the sport became popular outside the upper classes. [[Bodedern]] Cricket Club was formed in 1947.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}\n\n===Sailing===\nThe Royal Anglesey Yacht Club hosts the Menai Strait Regatta yearly.\n\n===Swimming===\nThe Menai Strait hosts two annual open-water swimming contests: the Menai Strait Swim from Foel to Caernarfon (1 mile), and the Pier to Pier Open Water Swim, between [[Beaumaris Pier|Beaumaris]] and [[Garth Pier]], Bangor.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Roman conquest of Anglesey]]\n*[[List of Scheduled Monuments in Anglesey]]\n*[[List of places in Anglesey]]\n*[[List of Anglesey towns by population]]\n*[[HMS Anglesea]], four ships of the [[Royal Navy]].\n*[[Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey|List of Lord Lieutenants of Anglesey]]\n*[[Custos Rotulorum of Anglesey]]\n*[[Sheriff of Anglesey|List of Sheriffs of Anglesey]]\n*[[Ynys M\u00f4n (UK Parliament constituency)]]\n*[[Ynys M\u00f4n (Assembly constituency)]]\n*[[List of islands of Wales]] \u2013 including those around Anglesey\n*[[Cestyll Garden]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite encyclopaedia |ref={{harvid |ETBRS |2005a}} |article=Fox Hunting (Wales) |pages=125 |last=Lile |first=Emma |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports |series=Sports Reference series |editor-last=Collins|editor-first=Tony |editor2-last=Martin |editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Vamplew |editor3-first=Wray |publisher=Routledge|date=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-35224-6}}.\n*{{citation |ref={{harvid |ETBRS |2005b}} |contribution=Football (Wales) |pages=120\u2013121 |last=Lile |first=Emma |title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports |series=Sports Reference series |editor-last=Collins |editor-first=Tony |editor2-last=Martin |editor2-first=John |editor3-last=Vamplew |editor3-first=Wray |publisher=Routledge |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-35224-6}}.\n*{{citation |page=111 |title=Anglesey: The Concise History, ''Vol. 1'' |series=Histories of Wales |first=David A. |last=Pretty|publisher=University of Wales Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0708319437}}\n\n'''Attribution:'''\n*{{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anglesey |volume=2 |pages=17\u201318}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Anglesey}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Anglesey}}\n*{{Cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anglesea |volume=2 |page=30 |short=x}}\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/Wales/Isle_of_Anglesey|Isle of Anglesey}}\n\n{{Anglesey}}\n{{Communities of Anglesey}}\n{{Wales Districts}}\n{{Wales subdivisions}}\n{{Historic Counties of Wales}}\n{{AONBs in Wales}}\n{{History of the British Isles|bar=yes}}\n\n{{Coord|53|17|N|4|20|W|region:GB_type:isle|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anglesey}}\n[[Category:Anglesey|Anglesey]]\n[[Category:Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Wales]]\n[[Category:Counties of Wales]]\n[[Category:Principal areas of Wales]]\n[[Category:Cantrefs]]\n[[Category:Commotes of Gwynedd]]\n[[Category:Historic counties of Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAssociation football:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2019-20 \u2192 2019\u201320", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglesey"}
