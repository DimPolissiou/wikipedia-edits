They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur<ref> A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135\n</ref>. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref> A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134\n</ref> \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992), 48</ref>, [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009), p.20</ref>, [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]]. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973)<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref>.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].

The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!

Starting with CorelDraw 3, the file format changed to a [[Resource Interchange File Format]] (RIFF) envelope, recognizable by the first four bytes of the file being \"RIFF\", and a \"CDR*vrsn\" in bytes 9 to 15, with the asterisk \"*\" being just a blank in early versions.<ref>{{cite web|title=CorelDRAW CDR Signature Format|url=http://www.ntfs.com/corel-draw-format.htm|website=NTFS.com|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> Beginning with CorelDraw 4 it included the version number of the writing program in hexadecimal (\"4\" meaning version 4, \"D\" meaning version 14). The actual data chunk of the RIFF remains a Corel proprietary format.\n\nFrom version X4 (14) on, the CDR file is a ZIP-compressed directory of several files, among them XML files and the RIFF-structured ''riffdata.cdr'' with the familiar version signature in versions X4 (CDREvrsn) and X5 (CDRFvrsn), and a ''root.dat'' with CorelDraw X6, where the bytes 9 to 15 look slightly different -- \"CDRGfver\" in a file created with X6. \"F\" was the last valid hex digit, and the \"fver\" now indicates that the letter before no longer represents a hex digit.\n\nThere is no publicly available CDR file format specification.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corel Draw file format |url=http://coreldraw.com/forums/p/2922/10354.aspx |author=Corel Corporation |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.game2soft.net  |title=.CDR File Extension |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOther CorelDraw file formats include CorelDraw Compressed (CDX), CorelDraw Template (CDT)<ref name=\"CorelDRAW Template format\">{{cite web |url=http://product.corel.com/help/CorelDRAW/540229932/Main/EN/Documentation/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=CorelDRAW-Other-file-formats.html |title=CorelDRAW X7 Supported file formats : CorelDRAW Template (CDT) - Additional file formats}}</ref> and Corel Presentation Exchange (CMX).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://product.corel.com/help/CorelDRAW/540229932/Main/EN/Documentation/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=CorelDRAW-Corel-Presentation-Exchange-CMX.html#3802035 |title=Corel Presentation Exchange (CMX), CorelDRAW X7 Help}}</ref>\n\n===Use of CDR files in other programs===\nIn December 2006 the [[sK1 (program)|sK1]] [[open-source software|open-source]] project team started to [[reverse-engineer]] the CDR format.<ref name=\"sk1\">{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=sk1 |title=sK1 illustration program - The history of sK1 |accessdate=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129124558/http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=sk1 |archivedate=2010-11-29 }}</ref> The results and the first working snapshot of the CDR importer were presented at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2007 conference taking place in May 2007 in Montreal (Canada).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2007/program.html |title=Libre Graphics Meeting 2007 - Friday May 4 |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> Later on the team parsed the structure of other Corel formats with the help of the open source CDR Explorer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=cdrexplorer |title=CDR explorer |accessdate=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129124615/http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=cdrexplorer |archivedate=2010-11-29 }}</ref> As of 2008, the sK1 project claims to have the best import support for CorelDraw file formats among open source software programs.

It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the [[bitmap-image editor]] [[Corel Photo-Paint]] as well as other graphics-related programs (see below). The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!

[[Dynamo Kyiv]] were the defending 13-times champions. A total of sixteen teams participated in the league, twelve of them have contested in the [[1990 Soviet Top League|1990 season]] while the remaining four were promoted from the [[Soviet First League]] due to withdrawals. The representatives of the [[Baltic states]] as well as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] chose not to take part in the competition.\n\nThe season began on 10 March and lasted until 2 November 1991. The season was won by [[PFC CSKA Moscow]] that returned to the top league prior to the last season while winning the [[Soviet Cup]] competition as well. Due to participants withdrawal in the preceding season four new teams entered the league. Upon the conclusion of the season no clubs were relegated and 12 out of its 16 participants formed a base for either the Russian or the Ukrainian competitions, while other four participants joined their own newly formed national leagues. If the Soviet Union had remained intact, [[Metallist Kharkov]] and [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] would have been relegated to the [[Soviet First League]] for the next season, while [[FC Rotor Volgograd]] and [[FC Tiligul Tiraspol]] would have been promoted to the Top League for 1992.\n\nTop six clubs of the league later entered European competitions for their respective nations.

[[Dynamo Kyiv]] were the defending 13-times champions. A total of sixteen teams participated in the league, twelve of them have contested in the [[1990 Soviet Top League|1990 season]] while the remaining four were promoted from the [[Soviet First League]] due to withdrawals. The representatives of the [[Baltic states]] as well as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] chose not to take part in the competition.\n\nThe season began on 10 March and lasted until 2 November 1991. The season was won by [[PFC CSKA Moscow]] that returned to the top league prior to the last season while winning the [[Soviet Cup]] competition as well. Due to participants withdrawal in the preceding season four new teams entered the league. Upon the conclusion of the season no clubs were relegated and 12 out of its 16 participants formed a base for either the Russian or the Ukrainian competitions, while other four participants joined their own newly formed national leagues. If the Soviet Union had remained intact, [[Metallist Kharkov]] and [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] would have been relegated to the [[Soviet First League]] for the next season, while [[FC Rotor Volgograd]] and [[FC Tiligul Tiraspol]] would have been promoted to the Top League for 1992.\n\nTop six clubs of the league later entered European competitions for their respective nations. The Ukrainian clubs chose to qualify through a [[1992 Ukrainian Premier League|separate national competition]].\n\n==Participating teams==\nThe league was expanded to 16 after the last season, during which number of clubs left the Soviet competitions (from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Baltic states]]). The last-placed [[FC Rotor Volgograd]] of the [[1990 Soviet Top League]] lost promotion/relegation playoff to [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] and was relegated to the [[1991 Soviet First League]]. Rotor Volograd returned to the [[Soviet First League]] after two seasons absence, while at the same time [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] after only a one-season absence.\n\nBeside the fourth placed Lokomotiv three more teams were promoted and included the champion ([[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz]]) and the runners-up of the [[1990 Soviet First League]] ([[FC Pakhtakor Tashkent]] and [[FC Metalurh Zaporizhia|FC Metallurg Zaporozhye]]).\n\n* [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz]] \u2013 champions ''(returning for the first time since [[1970 Soviet Top League|1970]] after 20 seasons absence)''\n* [[FC Pakhtakor Tashkent]] \u2013 2nd place ''(returning after six seasons)''\n* [[FC Metalurh Zaporizhia|FC Metallurg Zaporozhye]] \u2013 3rd place ''(debut)''\n* [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] \u2013 promotion play-off ''(returning after a season)''\n\n{{Location map+|USSR|AlternativeMap = Soviet Union location map (no rivers).svg|width=800|float=none|caption=Location of teams in the '''1991 Soviet Top League'''.\n| places =\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = '''Moscow'''<br />[[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]]<br />[[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]]<br />[[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dinamo]]<br />[[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]]<br />[[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo]]\n  | position = right\n  | lat_deg = 55.75\n  | lon_deg = 37.61 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dinamo Kiev]]\n  | position = top\n  | lat_deg = 50.45\n  | lon_deg = 30.523333 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chernomorets]]\n  | position = top\n  | lat_deg = 46.466667\n  | lon_deg = 30.733333 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Ararat Yerevan|Ararat]]\n  | position = top\n  | lat_deg = 40.183333\n  | lon_deg = 44.516667 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]]\n  | lat_deg = 53.9\n  | lon_deg = 27.566667 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Pamir Dushanbe|Pamir]]\n  | position = right\n  | lat_deg = 38.585906\n  | lon_deg = 68.769511 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz|Spartak Vladikavkaz]]\n  | lat_deg = 43.016667\n  | lon_deg = 44.65 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Dnipro|Dnepr]]\n  | position = top\n  | lat_deg = 48.45\n  | lon_deg = 34.983333 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhter]]\n  | lat_deg = 48.002778\n  | lon_deg = 37.805278 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Metalurh Zaporizhia|Metallurg]]\n  | position = left\n  | lat_deg = 47.833333\n  | lon_deg = 35.166667 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metallist]]\n  | lat_deg = 50.004444\n  | lon_deg = 36.231389 }}\n{{Location map~ | USSR\n  | label = [[FC Pakhtakor Tashkent|Pakhtakor]]\n  | position = top\n  | lat_deg = 41.266667\n  | lon_deg = 69.216667 }}\n}}\n\n=== Stadiums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

J. Soles]], [[Sean Young]], and [[John Candy]]. Several actors including [[John Larroquette]],  [[John Diehl (actor)|John Diehl]], [[Conrad Dunn]], and [[Judge Reinhold]] were featured in their first significant film roles. [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Timothy Busfield]], and [[Bill Paxton]] also appeared early in their careers.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Winger is a cab driver in [[Louisville]] who, in the span of a few hours, loses his job, his apartment, his car, and his girlfriend. Realizing that he is a loser with no prospects, he decides to join the [[US Army|Army]]. Talking his best friend Russell Ziskey, a teacher of English as a second language, into joining with him, they go to a recruiting office and are soon sent off to basic training.\n\nUpon arriving at Fort Arnold, they meet their fellow recruits, and their [[drill sergeant]], Sergeant Hulka. Moments after arriving, John angers Sgt. Hulka and is ordered out to do push-ups. He stands out as a slacker throughout basic training. Their commanding officer is the arrogant and incompetent Captain Stillman. As basic training progresses, Russell and John become romantically linked to female [[Military Police Corps (United States)|MPs]] Louise Cooper and Stella Hansen. Not long before graduation, Sgt. Hulka is injured when Stillman, trying to impress a visiting colonel, orders a mortar crew to fire without setting target coordinates.\n\nThe men go to a mud wrestling bar, where John convinces Dewey \"Ox\" Oxberger to wrestle a group of women. When the club is raided by MPs and police, Stella and Louise cover for John and Russell. The rest of the platoon are returned to base, where a furious Stillman threatens to make them all repeat basic training.\n\nAfter partying with Stella and Louise, the buddies return to the barracks, and John motivates the platoon with a passionate speech and begins to get them in shape for graduation. After a long night of practice, they oversleep and almost miss the ceremony. They rush to the parade grounds in their fatigues. There they give an eccentric, yet highly coordinated, drill display led by John. General Barnicke is impressed when he finds out that they had to complete training without a drill sergeant, and decides they are just the kind of \"go-getters\" he wants working on his EM-50 project in Italy.\n\nOnce in Italy, the platoon is reunited with a recovered Sgt. Hulka and assigned to guard the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle, an [[armored personnel carrier]] disguised as a [[GMC Motorhome|recreational vehicle]]. Fed up with their boring assignment, John and Russell steal the EM-50 to visit their girlfriends, stationed in [[West Germany]]. When Stillman finds the EM-50 missing, he launches an unauthorized mission to get the vehicle back before his superiors find out it is gone. Hulka urges Stillman not to go, but is overruled.\n\nStillman inadvertently leads the platoon across the border into [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Hulka, recognizing where they are, jumps out of the truck just before it is captured by the [[Soviet Army]]. He makes a mayday radio call that is heard by John and Russell, who realize that the platoon came looking for them and are now in danger. John, Russell, Stella, and Louise take the EM-50 and infiltrate a Soviet base where the platoon is being held. With some assistance from Hulka, they save the entire platoon.\n\nUpon returning to the US, John, Russell, Louise, Stella, and Hulka are treated as heroes, each being awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. Hulka retires and opens the HulkaBurger franchise. Stella appears on the cover of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', Ox makes the cover of ''[[Tiger Beat]]'', Russell recreates his firefight with the Russians for ''Guts'' magazine, and John is featured on the cover of ''Newsworld''. The disgraced Captain Stillman is reassigned to a weather station near [[Nome, Alaska]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Actors with WP articles only; as named and in credits order -->\n* [[Bill Murray]] as John Winger\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Russell Ziskey\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Sgt.

Len Blum and Dan Goldberg wrote the screenplay in [[Toronto]] and read it to Reitman, who was in [[Los Angeles]], over the phone. The director, in turn, would give the writers notes. Cheech and Chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control. Reitman then suggested to Goldberg that they change the two main characters to ones suited for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, figuring if they could get Ramis interested and let him tailor the script for the two of them, he could convince Murray to do it.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nRamis had already co-written ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''Meatballs'', and ''[[Caddyshack]]'', but was relatively unknown as a film actor.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> His best-known acting work prior to ''Stripes'' was as a cast member for the late-night TV sketch comedy ''[[Second City Television]]'', which he had quit a few years earlier.<ref>Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S.

J. Soles reported that [[Dennis Quaid]] had read for the role of Russell and that Ramis was reluctant to appear in the film, but that Murray told Ramis he did not wish to work with anyone else and would leave the film unless he played the other principal.<ref name=\"rabin\">{{cite news |last = Rabin |first = Nathan |title = Random Roles: P.J.

[[Sean Young]] was cast based on her looks, and Reitman felt that her \"sweetness\" would go well with Ramis.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> [[P. J. Soles]] tested with Murray and they got along well together. [[John Diehl]] had never auditioned before and won his first paying job as an actor. Goldberg knew [[John Candy]] from Toronto and told Reitman that he should be in the film; he was not required to audition.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nReitman was a fan of the westerns that [[Warren Oates]] had been in and wanted someone who was strong and that everyone respected to control the film's misfit platoon. Reinhold said that during filming Oates would tell stories about working on films like ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' and they would be enthralled. Reitman wanted \"a little bit of weight in the center\", and added the argument between Hulka and Winger.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> It was not played for laughs and allowed Murray to do a serious scene, something he had not done before. During filming one of the obstacle courses scenes, Reitman told the actors to grab Oates and drag him into the mud without telling the veteran actor about it to see what would happen and get a genuine reaction. Oates' front tooth got chipped in the process and he yelled at Reitman for what he did.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nEvery scene had some element of improvisation due in large part to Murray and Ramis. Much of the mud wrestling scene was made up on the spot by Reitman. Candy felt uncomfortable during filming, but Reitman talked him through it. The spatula scene in the kitchen of the general's house was filmed at three in the morning, after the cast and crew had been up the entire day.

J. Soles]], [[Sean Young]], and [[John Candy]]. Several actors including [[John Larroquette]],  [[John Diehl (actor)|John Diehl]], [[Conrad Dunn]], and [[Judge Reinhold]] were featured in their first significant film roles. [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Timothy Busfield]], and [[Bill Paxton]] also appeared early in their careers.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Winger is a cab driver in [[Louisville]] who, in the span of a few hours, loses his job, his apartment, his car, and his girlfriend. Realizing that he is a loser with no prospects, he decides to join the [[US Army|Army]]. Talking his best friend Russell Ziskey, a teacher of English as a second language, into joining with him, they go to a recruiting office and are soon sent off to basic training.\n\nUpon arriving at Fort Arnold, they meet their fellow recruits, and their [[drill sergeant]], Sergeant Hulka. Moments after arriving, John angers Sgt. Hulka and is ordered out to do push-ups. He stands out as a slacker throughout basic training. Their commanding officer is the arrogant and incompetent Captain Stillman. As basic training progresses, Russell and John become romantically linked to female [[Military Police Corps (United States)|MPs]] Louise Cooper and Stella Hansen. Not long before graduation, Sgt. Hulka is injured when Stillman, trying to impress a visiting colonel, orders a mortar crew to fire without setting target coordinates.\n\nThe men go to a mud wrestling bar, where John convinces Dewey \"Ox\" Oxberger to wrestle a group of women. When the club is raided by MPs and police, Stella and Louise cover for John and Russell. The rest of the platoon are returned to base, where a furious Stillman threatens to make them all repeat basic training.\n\nAfter partying with Stella and Louise, the buddies return to the barracks, and John motivates the platoon with a passionate speech and begins to get them in shape for graduation. After a long night of practice, they oversleep and almost miss the ceremony. They rush to the parade grounds in their fatigues. There they give an eccentric, yet highly coordinated, drill display led by John. General Barnicke is impressed when he finds out that they had to complete training without a drill sergeant, and decides they are just the kind of \"go-getters\" he wants working on his EM-50 project in Italy.\n\nOnce in Italy, the platoon is reunited with a recovered Sgt. Hulka and assigned to guard the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle, an [[armored personnel carrier]] disguised as a [[GMC Motorhome|recreational vehicle]]. Fed up with their boring assignment, John and Russell steal the EM-50 to visit their girlfriends, stationed in [[West Germany]]. When Stillman finds the EM-50 missing, he launches an unauthorized mission to get the vehicle back before his superiors find out it is gone. Hulka urges Stillman not to go, but is overruled.\n\nStillman inadvertently leads the platoon across the border into [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Hulka, recognizing where they are, jumps out of the truck just before it is captured by the [[Soviet Army]]. He makes a mayday radio call that is heard by John and Russell, who realize that the platoon came looking for them and are now in danger. John, Russell, Stella, and Louise take the EM-50 and infiltrate a Soviet base where the platoon is being held. With some assistance from Hulka, they save the entire platoon.\n\nUpon returning to the US, John, Russell, Louise, Stella, and Hulka are treated as heroes, each being awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. Hulka retires and opens the HulkaBurger franchise. Stella appears on the cover of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', Ox makes the cover of ''[[Tiger Beat]]'', Russell recreates his firefight with the Russians for ''Guts'' magazine, and John is featured on the cover of ''Newsworld''. The disgraced Captain Stillman is reassigned to a weather station near [[Nome, Alaska]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Actors with WP articles only; as named and in credits order -->\n* [[Bill Murray]] as John Winger\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Russell Ziskey\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Sgt.

Len Blum and Dan Goldberg wrote the screenplay in [[Toronto]] and read it to Reitman, who was in [[Los Angeles]], over the phone. The director, in turn, would give the writers notes. Cheech and Chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control. Reitman then suggested to Goldberg that they change the two main characters to ones suited for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, figuring if they could get Ramis interested and let him tailor the script for the two of them, he could convince Murray to do it.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nRamis had already co-written ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''Meatballs'', and ''[[Caddyshack]]'', but was relatively unknown as a film actor.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> His best-known acting work prior to ''Stripes'' was as a cast member for the late-night TV sketch comedy ''[[Second City Television]]'', which he had quit a few years earlier.<ref>Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S.

[[Sean Young]] was cast based on her looks, and Reitman felt that her \"sweetness\" would go well with Ramis.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> [[P. J. Soles]] tested with Murray and they got along well together. [[John Diehl]] had never auditioned before and won his first paying job as an actor. Goldberg knew [[John Candy]] from Toronto and told Reitman that he should be in the film; he was not required to audition.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nReitman was a fan of the westerns that [[Warren Oates]] had been in and wanted someone who was strong and that everyone respected to control the film's misfit platoon. Reinhold said that during filming Oates would tell stories about working on films like ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' and they would be enthralled. Reitman wanted \"a little bit of weight in the center\", and added the argument between Hulka and Winger.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> It was not played for laughs and allowed Murray to do a serious scene, something he had not done before. During filming one of the obstacle courses scenes, Reitman told the actors to grab Oates and drag him into the mud without telling the veteran actor about it to see what would happen and get a genuine reaction. Oates' front tooth got chipped in the process and he yelled at Reitman for what he did.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nEvery scene had some element of improvisation due in large part to Murray and Ramis. Much of the mud wrestling scene was made up on the spot by Reitman. Candy felt uncomfortable during filming, but Reitman talked him through it. The spatula scene in the kitchen of the general's house was filmed at three in the morning, after the cast and crew had been up the entire day. Murray improvised the \"[[Aunt Jemima]] Treatment\" sequence and Soles reacted naturally to whatever he said and did.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nFilming began in [[Kentucky]] in November 1980, then moved to California in December.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.
