Her parents were [[Theodosia Blachford|Theodosia Tighe]], a [[Methodist]] leader, and [[William Blachford]] (d.1773?), a [[Church of Ireland]] clergyman and librarian. She had a strict religious upbringing, and when she was twenty-one she married [[Henry Tighe]] (1768\u20131836), [[cousin marriage|her first cousin]] and a member of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] for [[Inistioge]], [[County Kilkenny]]. The marriage is said to have been unhappy, though little is known.\n\nThe couple moved to London in the early nineteenth century. She became acquainted with [[Thomas Moore]], an early admirer of her writing, and others interested in literature. Although she had written since girlhood, she published nothing until ''Psyche'' (1805), a six-canto [[Allegory#Poetry and fiction|allegorical poem]] in [[Edmund Spenser|Spenserian]] stanzas. ''Psyche'' was admired by many and praised by Moore in his poem, \"To Mrs. Henry Tighe on reading her Psyche\".{{sfn|Moore|1929|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nHaving suffered for at least a year, Mary Tighe endured a serious attack of [[tuberculosis]] in 1805. In February 1805 Moore states that she had \"a very serious struggle for life\" and in August of the same year that she was 'ordered to the Madeiras'. Moore also claimed that \"another winter will inevitably be her death\".{{sfn|Moore|1853|p=1.86, 90}} Tighe lived for another five years and spent her last few months as an invalid at her brother-in-law's [[Woodstock Estate|estate in Woodstock]], [[County Wicklow]], Ireland. She was buried in the church at nearby Inistioge.{{sfn|Perkins|2004}} Her diary was destroyed, though a cousin had copied out excerpts.{{sfn|Linkin|2005}}\n\nThe year following her death, a new edition of ''Psyche'' was released, along with some previously unpublished poems; it was this edition that established her literary reputation. [[John Keats]] was one of her admirers and paid tribute to her in his poem, \"To Some Ladies\".<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/126/5.html \"To Some Ladies\"].</ref> Pam Perkins writes that \"[d]espite the bleakness of many of the short poems in the 1811 volume, in much of the nineteenth-century writing on Tighe there is a tendency to make her an exemplar of patiently (and picturesquely) long-suffering femininity, a tendency exemplified most famously in [[Felicia Hemans]]'s tribute to her, 'The Grave of a Poetess'.\"{{sfn|Perkins|2004}}<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/hemans/records/grave.html 'The Grave of a Poetess.']</ref>\n\nA statue of her was sculpted by [[Lorenzo Bartolini]], and was held at Woodstock House until it was [[Irish Civil War|burned down in 1922]]. According to the [[Uffizi]], the statue was commissioned by her son after her death, and was delivered to Ireland around 1820.<ref>[http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/bartolini/Archivio/Ricerca?page=18]</ref>\n\n== ''Psyche'' ==\n[[File:Psych\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|Psych\u00e9]]\n[[File:Briton Rivi\u00e8re - Una and the Lion.jpg|thumb|Unalion]]\n\"Psyche, or the legend of love\" is Mary Tighe's rendition of the Greco-Roman folktale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], which is recorded in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (or ''Metamorphoses'') by [[Lucius Apuleius]], the [[Silver Age]] Roman author. ''Psyche, or the Legend of Love'' was privately printed in a run of only 50 copies in 1805. It was republished posthumously in 1811 with other, previously unpublished works by [[Longman]], London.<ref>[http://web.nmsu.edu/~hlinkin/ Etext] of Psyche from the 1811 ed.</ref>\n\nThe story is about a princess named Psyche who is so beautiful that the people of her kingdom begin to worship her as the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Venus becomes envious of the attention that Psyche receives and sends her son [[Cupid]] to Psyche to make her fall in love with a monster. Instead Cupid falls in love with Psyche, and marries her without his mother's knowledge.  He whisks her away to a far-away palace, where she is served by invisible servants, and he visits her only at night, so she cannot discover his true identity. One night Psyche's curiosity gets the better of her, and after he falls asleep she lights a lamp to see her husband's face. When she realises her husband is no monster, rather a god, she is so surprised a drop of oil falls from her lamp and burns Cupid, waking him. He flees, and to regain her husband Psyche seeks the help of his mother Venus, who sends her out to complete various tasks in penance. In her final task, she is sent to retrieve a box from the underworld containing some of [[Proserpina]]'s beauty. Although instructed not to look inside the box, she opens it, and Psyche is overcome by a never-ending sleep. Cupid saves her, and in the end Psyche is transformed into a goddess herself by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].\n\nThe bulk of Tighe's version of the story is taken from Apuleius, but her poem, written in [[Spenserian stanza]]s, is riddled with small details which point to Cupid's and Psyche's shared characteristics and equal standing, implying that their love is mutual, and this idea is taken further in the heavily adapted second half of the epic, where Cupid joins Psyche on her penitent journey. In the first encounter between the two lovers, Tighe mirrors a passage from Apuleius but reverses the roles, showing the similarities between the two.  As Cupid comes to Psyche at his mother's request, ready to use his love-inducing arrows, he leans over her, but is then overcome by her beauty and:\n:The dart which in his hand now trembling stood, \n:As o'er the couch he bent with ravished eye, \n:Drew with its daring point celestial blood \n:From his smooth neck's unblemished ivory: (canto 1, 244\u2013247). \nMuch of the same imagery is found in the Metamorphoses, but later in Apuleius\u2019 narrative, as Psyche is overcome at the sight of Cupid and the weapons that testify to his divinity. Tighe was familiar with the ancient novel, so this similarity is likely deliberate. The novelist writes:\n:Now Psyche, with her insatiable mind, examined these with more than a little curiosity, and as she was studying and admiring the weapons of her husband, trembling she drew one arrow from the quiver to test the point on the tip of her thumb, but she pressed too deeply, so that tiny drops of rosy-red blood dotted her skin like dew.  Thus did unknowing Psyche suddenly fall in love with Love, burning more and more with desire for Desire. (Apul. Met. 5.23).\nThe many similarities between the two passages strengthen the relationship and the comparison between the two figures.  Arrows are held with \u201ctrembling\u201d hands, blood stains perfect skin, and neither is aware of the fateful prick.  In Tighe's version, Cupid is as much a victim of himself as Psyche is, and she makes explicit that her feelings are mutual. In a major departure from Apuleius\u2019 storyline, Cupid accompanies Psyche on her series of trials, disguised as a [[wikt:Special:Search/white knight|white knight]] on his own journey to regain his beloved.  This unique element of Tighe's narrative serves to emphasise the equal responsibility of both genders in romantic relationships.  When the white knight first introduces himself to Psyche, hiding his true identity as Cupid, he tells her:\n:\u201cI too (he said) divided from my love, \n:\u201cThe offended power of Venus deprecate, \n:\u201cLike thee, through paths untrodden, sadly rove \n:\u201cIn search of that fair spot prescribed by fate, \n:\u201cThe blessed term of my afflicted state,\u201d (canto 3, 127\u2013131).\nBy describing him thus, Cupid becomes a male version of Psyche, needing to perform his own series of trials to become worthy of his lover.   The tasks Venus sends them to do cease to be a form of penance and become a mutual journey, and both lovers grow as individuals, helping each other to defeat various vices and temptations, in a very moralising and Christian version of the Roman tale.\n\nShe also makes allusions to [[Edmund Spenser|Spencer]]'s ''[[The Fairie Queene|Fairie Queene]]'' during Psyche's final task set by Venus. \"A cruel monster now her steps pursued, Well known of yore and named the Blatant Beast.{{sfn|Tighe|1811}}\n\n== Other works ==\n*''Selena'' (unpublished novel).

Her parents were [[Theodosia Blachford|Theodosia Tighe]], a [[Methodist]] leader, and [[William Blachford]] (d.1773?), a [[Church of Ireland]] clergyman and librarian. She had a strict religious upbringing, and when she was twenty-one she married [[Henry Tighe]] (1768\u20131836), [[cousin marriage|her first cousin]] and a member of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] for [[Inistioge]], [[County Kilkenny]]. The marriage is said to have been unhappy, though little is known.\n\nThe couple moved to London in the early nineteenth century. She became acquainted with [[Thomas Moore]], an early admirer of her writing, and others interested in literature. Although she had written since girlhood, she published nothing until ''Psyche'' (1805), a six-canto [[Allegory#Poetry_and_fiction|allegorical poem]] in [[Edmund Spenser|Spenserian]] stanzas. ''Psyche'' was admired by many and praised by Moore in his poem, \"To Mrs. Henry Tighe on reading her Psyche\".{{sfn|Moore|1929|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nHaving suffered for at least a year, Mary Tighe endured a serious attack of [[tuberculosis]] in 1805. In February 1805 Moore states that she had \"a very serious struggle for life\" and in August of the same year that she was 'ordered to the Madeiras'. Moore also claimed that \"another winter will inevitably be her death\".{{sfn|Moore|1853|p=1.86, 90}} Tighe lived for another five years and spent her last few months as an invalid at her brother-in-law's [[Woodstock Estate|estate in Woodstock]], [[County Wicklow]], Ireland. She was buried in the church at nearby Inistioge.{{sfn|Perkins|2004}} Her diary was destroyed, though a cousin had copied out excerpts.{{sfn|Linkin|2005}}\n\nThe year following her death, a new edition of ''Psyche'' was released, along with some previously unpublished poems; it was this edition that established her literary reputation. [[John Keats]] was one of her admirers and paid tribute to her in his poem, \"To Some Ladies\".<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/126/5.html \"To Some Ladies\"].</ref> Pam Perkins writes that \"[d]espite the bleakness of many of the short poems in the 1811 volume, in much of the nineteenth-century writing on Tighe there is a tendency to make her an exemplar of patiently (and picturesquely) long-suffering femininity, a tendency exemplified most famously in [[Felicia Hemans]]'s tribute to her, 'The Grave of a Poetess'.\"{{sfn|Perkins|2004}}<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/hemans/records/grave.html 'The Grave of a Poetess.']</ref>\n\nA statue of her was sculpted by [[Lorenzo Bartolini]], and was held at Woodstock House until it was [[Irish Civil War|burned down in 1922]]. According to the [[Uffizi]], the statue was commissioned by her son after her death, and was delivered to Ireland around 1820.<ref>[http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/bartolini/Archivio/Ricerca?page=18]</ref>\n\n== ''Psyche'' ==\n[[File:Psych\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|Psych\u00e9]]\n[[File:Briton Rivi\u00e8re - Una and the Lion.jpg|thumb|Unalion]]\n\"Psyche, or the legend of love\" is Mary Tighe's rendition of the Greco-Roman folktale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], which is recorded in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (or ''Metamorphoses'') by [[Lucius Apuleius]], the [[Silver Age]] Roman author. ''Psyche, or the Legend of Love'' was privately printed in a run of only 50 copies in 1805. It was republished posthumously in 1811 with other, previously unpublished works by [[Longman]], London.<ref>[http://web.nmsu.edu/~hlinkin/ Etext] of Psyche from the 1811 ed.</ref>\n\nThe story is about a princess named Psyche who is so beautiful that the people of her kingdom begin to worship her as the goddess [[Venus]]. Venus becomes envious of the attention that Psyche receives and sends her son [[Cupid]] to Psyche to make her fall in love with a monster. Instead Cupid falls in love with Psyche, and marries her without his mother's knowledge.  He whisks her away to a far-away palace, where she is served by invisible servants, and he visits her only at night, so she cannot discover his true identity. One night Psyche's curiosity gets the better of her, and after he falls asleep she lights a lamp to see her husband's face. When she realises her husband is no monster, rather a god, she is so surprised a drop of oil falls from her lamp and burns Cupid, waking him. He flees, and to regain her husband Psyche seeks the help of his mother Venus, who sends her out to complete various tasks in penance. In her final task, she is sent to retrieve a box from the underworld containing some of [[Proserpina]]'s beauty. Although instructed not to look inside the box, she opens it, and Psyche is overcome by a never-ending sleep. Cupid saves her, and in the end Psyche is transformed into a goddess herself by [[Jupiter]].\n\nThe bulk of Tighe's version of the story is taken from Apuleius, but her poem, written in [[Spenserian stanza]]s, is riddled with small details which point to Cupid's and Psyche's shared characteristics and equal standing, implying that their love is mutual, and this idea is taken further in the heavily adapted second half of the epic, where Cupid joins Psyche on her penitent journey. In the first encounter between the two lovers, Tighe mirrors a passage from Apuleius but reverses the roles, showing the similarities between the two.  As Cupid comes to Psyche at his mother's request, ready to use his love-inducing arrows, he leans over her, but is then overcome by her beauty and:\n:The dart which in his hand now trembling stood, \n:As o'er the couch he bent with ravished eye, \n:Drew with its daring point celestial blood \n:From his smooth neck's unblemished ivory: (canto 1, 244\u2013247). \nMuch of the same imagery is found in the Metamorphoses, but later in Apuleius\u2019 narrative, as Psyche is overcome at the sight of Cupid and the weapons that testify to his divinity. Tighe was familiar with the ancient novel, so this similarity is likely deliberate. The novelist writes:\n:Now Psyche, with her insatiable mind, examined these with more than a little curiosity, and as she was studying and admiring the weapons of her husband, trembling she drew one arrow from the quiver to test the point on the tip of her thumb, but she pressed too deeply, so that tiny drops of rosy-red blood dotted her skin like dew.  Thus did unknowing Psyche suddenly fall in love with Love, burning more and more with desire for Desire. (Apul. Met. 5.23).\nThe many similarities between the two passages strengthen the relationship and the comparison between the two figures.  Arrows are held with \u201ctrembling\u201d hands, blood stains perfect skin, and neither is aware of the fateful prick.  In Tighe\u2019s version, Cupid is as much a victim of himself as Psyche is, and she makes explicit that her feelings are mutual. In a major departure from Apuleius\u2019 storyline, Cupid accompanies Psyche on her series of trials, disguised as a [[wikt:Special:Search/white knight|white knight]] on his own journey to regain his beloved.  This unique element of Tighe\u2019s narrative serves to emphasise the equal responsibility of both genders in romantic relationships.  When the white knight first introduces himself to Psyche, hiding his true identity as Cupid, he tells her:\n:\u201cI too (he said) divided from my love, \n:\u201cThe offended power of Venus deprecate, \n:\u201cLike thee, through paths untrodden, sadly rove \n:\u201cIn search of that fair spot prescribed by fate, \n:\u201cThe blessed term of my afflicted state,\u201d (canto 3, 127\u2013131).\nBy describing him thus, Cupid becomes a male version of Psyche, needing to perform his own series of trials to become worthy of his lover.   The tasks Venus sends them to do cease to be a form of penance and become a mutual journey, and both lovers grow as individuals, helping each other to defeat various vices and temptations, in a very moralising and Christian version of the Roman tale.\n\nShe also makes allusions to [[Edmund Spenser|Spencer]]'s ''[[The Fairie Queene|Fairie Queene]]'' during Psyche's final task set by Venus. \"A cruel monster now her steps pursued, Well known of yore and named the Blatant Beast.{{sfn|Tighe|1811}}\n\n== Other works ==\n*''Selena'' (unpublished novel).

Muhammad describes major ''shirk'' in two forms:<ref name=\"Kamoonpuri\"/>\n*To associate anyone with Allah as his partner (to believe in more than one god).\n*To associate Allah's attributes with someone else. (Attributing, considering, or portraying Allah's knowledge or might to being those of anyone else)\n\nOther interpretations also derived from the [[Quran]] and the prophetic tradition ([[Sunnah]]) divide ''shirk'' into three main categories. ''Shirk'' can be committed by acting against the three different categories.\n\n====Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship)====\nThis category of ''shirk'' refers to either the belief that others share Allah's lordship over creation as his equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no lord over creation at all.\n; ''Shirk'' by association: This is the ''shirk'' concerned with associating \"others\" with Allah.\n; ''Shirk'' by negation: This is ''shirk'' in Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship).\n\n====al-Asma wa's-Sifat (names and attributes)====\n''Shirk'' in this category includes both the non-believer practices of giving Allah the attributes of his creation as well as the act of giving created beings Allah's names and attributes.\n; ''Shirk'' by humanization: In this aspect of ''shirk'', Allah is given the form and qualities of human beings and animals. Due to man's superiority over animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent Allah in creation. Consequently, the image of the creator is often painted, moulded or carved in the shape of human beings possessing the physical features of those who worship them.\n; ''Shirk'' by deification: This form of ''shirk'' relates to cases where created beings or things are given or claim Allah's names or his attributes. For example, it was the practice of the ancient Arabs to worship idols whose names were derived from the names of Allah. Their main three idols were; [[Al-l\u0101t]] (taken from Allah's name al-Elah), [[al-'Uzza]] (taken from al-'Aziz), and [[Man\u0101t|al-Manat]] (taken from al-Mannan). During the era of Muhammad there was also a man in a region of Arabia called Yamamah, who claimed to be a prophet and took the name [[Ar-Rahman (Islamic term)|Rahman]] which, in Islam, belongs only to Allah.\n\n====al-'Ibadah (worship)====\nIn this category of ''shirk'', acts of worship are directed to others besides Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the creation instead of the creator. As in the case of the previous categories, ''shirk'' in ''al-'Ibadah'' has two main aspects.\n\nThis form of ''shirk'' occurs when any act of worship is directed to someone else besides Allah. It represents the most obvious form of [[idolatry]], against which the prophets were specifically sent by Allah, calling the masses of mankind to give it up. Examples of this ''shirk'' are asking for forgiveness, admittance to paradise, etc. that only Allah can provide, from others besides Allah.\n\n===Lesser shirk===\nLesser ''shirk'' or ''Shirke-e-Asghar'' means hidden polytheism. A person commits hidden polytheism when he professes ''tawhid'' (there is no god except Allah) but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief.<ref name=\"Kamoonpuri\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"One who offers the ritual prayers in an ostentatious way is a polytheist.

''Shirk'' can be committed by acting against the three different categories.\n\n====Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship)====\nThis category of ''shirk'' refers to either the belief that others share Allah's lordship over creation as his equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no lord over creation at all.\n; ''Shirk'' by association: This is the ''shirk'' concerned with associating \"others\" with Allah.\n; ''Shirk'' by negation: This is ''shirk'' in Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship).\n\n====al-Asma wa's-Sifat (names and attributes)====\n''Shirk'' in this category includes both the non-believer practices of giving Allah the attributes of his creation as well as the act of giving created beings Allah's names and attributes.\n; ''Shirk'' by humanization: In this aspect of ''shirk'', Allah is given the form and qualities of human beings and animals. Due to man's superiority over animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent Allah in creation. Consequently, the image of the creator is often painted, moulded or carved in the shape of human beings possessing the physical features of those who worship them.\n; ''Shirk'' by deification: This form of ''shirk'' relates to cases where created beings or things are given or claim Allah's names or his attributes. For example, it was the practice of the ancient Arabs to worship idols whose names were derived from the names of Allah. Their main three idols were; [[Al-l\u0101t]] (taken from Allah's name al-Elah), [[al-'Uzza]] (taken from al-'Aziz), and [[Man\u0101t|al-Manat]] (taken from al-Mannan). During the era of Muhammad there was also a man in a region of Arabia called Yamamah, who claimed to be a prophet and took the name [[Ar-Rahman (Islamic term)|Rahman]] which, in Islam, belongs only to Allah.\n\n====al-'Ibadah (worship)====\nIn this category of ''shirk'', acts of worship are directed to others besides Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the creation instead of the creator. As in the case of the previous categories, ''shirk'' in ''al-'Ibadah'' has two main aspects.\n\nThis form of ''shirk'' occurs when any act of worship is directed to someone else besides Allah. It represents the most obvious form of [[idolatry]], against which the prophets were specifically sent by Allah, calling the masses of mankind to give it up. Examples of this ''shirk'' are asking for forgiveness, admittance to paradise, etc. that only Allah can provide, from others besides Allah.\n\n===Lesser shirk===\nLesser ''shirk'' or ''Shirke-e-Asghar'' means hidden polytheism. A person commits hidden polytheism when he professes ''tawhid'' (there is no god except Allah) but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief.<ref name=\"Kamoonpuri\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"One who offers the ritual prayers in an ostentatious way is a polytheist. One who keeps the fast, or gives alms, or performs the ''Hajj'' to show the public his righteousness or to earn good name is a polytheist.\"|Muhammad<ref name=\"Kamoonpuri\"/>}}\n\nMahmud ibn Lubayd reported, \"Allah's messenger said: 'The thing I fear for you the most is ash-Shirk al-Asghar.'\"\n:The companions asked, \"O messenger of Allah, what is that?\"\n:He replied, \"Ar-Riya (showing off), for verily Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection when people are receiving their rewards, 'Go to those for whom you were showing off in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.'\"\n\nMahmud ibn Lubayd also said, \"The Prophet came out and announced, 'O people, beware of secret Shirk!'\"\n:The people asked, \"O messenger of Allah, what is secret Shirk?\"\n:He replied, \"When a man gets up to pray and strives to beautify his prayer because people are looking at him; that is secret Shirk.\"\n\n[[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Umar Ibn Al-Khattab]] narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: \"Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed an act of kufr or shirk.\" (graded [[Saheeh#.E1.B8.A4asan|''hasan'']] by [[Al-Tirmidhi]] and [[Saheeh#\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25|''saheeh'']] by [[Hakim al-Nishaburi|Al-Hakim]])\n\n[[Abdullah, son of Masud|Ibn Mas\u2019ood]], one of Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], said: \"That I should swear by Allah upon a lie is more preferable to me than that I should swear by another upon the truth.\"<ref>\"Kitab At-Tawheed\" by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, chapter 40</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[Henotheism]]\n* [[Islam and blasphemy]]\n* [[Islamic schools and branches]]\n* [[Islamic view of the Trinity]]\n* [[Islamic views on Jesus' death]]\n* [[Paganism]]\n* [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]\n* [[Shahada]] (confession)\n* [[Taghut]] (idolatry)\n* [[Ya-Ali]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite journal\n|title=Relations Between Muslims and Non-Muslims in the Thought of Western-Educated Muslim Intellectuals \u2013 Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations\n|journal=Islam and Christian\u2013Muslim Relations\n|volume=6\n|issue=2\n|pages=255\u2013277\n|doi=10.1080/09596419508721055\n|year=1995\n|last1=Zebiri\n|first1=Kate\n}}\n*[http://ashab-al-hadith.cf/Democracy-and-its-link-to-Shirk-in-the-legislation-of-men.html Shirk in legislation]\n{{Characters and names in the Quran}}\n\n[[Category:Islamic terminology]]\n[[Category:Islamic theology]]\n[[Category:Polytheism]]\n[[Category:Sin]]\n[[Category:Idolatry]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_(Islam)"}

{"title_page": "Mask (computing)", "text_new": "{{one source|date=April 2020}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]]. Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.\n\n==Common bitmask functions==\n\n===Masking bits to <code>1</code>===\nTo turn certain bits on, the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise <code>OR</code>]] operation can be used, following [[Logical disjunction#Bitwise operation|the principle]] that <code>Y OR 1 = 1</code> and <code>Y OR 0 = Y</code>. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, <code>OR</code> can be used with a <code>1</code>. To leave a bit unchanged, <code>OR</code> is used with a <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''on'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n  OR '''1111'''0000   '''1111'''0000\n   = '''1111'''0101   '''1111'''0101\n\n===Masking bits to <code>0</code>===\nMore often in practice bits are \"masked ''off''\" (or masked to <code>0</code>) than \"masked ''on''\" (or masked to <code>1</code>). When a bit is <code>AND</code>ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. <code>Y AND 0 = 0</code>. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be <code>AND</code>ed with <code>1</code>, since <code>Y AND 1 = Y</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''off'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1010'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n AND '''0000'''1111   '''0000'''1111\n   = '''0000'''0101   '''0000'''0101\n\n===Querying the status of a bit===\nIt is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise <code>AND</code> is done as discussed [[#Masking bits to 0|above]] and the value is compared with <code>1</code>. If it is equal to <code>0</code>, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Querying the status of the 4th bit\n     1001'''1'''101   1001'''0'''101\n AND 0000'''1'''000   0000'''1'''000\n   = 0000'''1'''000   0000'''0'''000\n\n===Toggling bit values===\nSo far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the [[Exclusive or|<code>XOR</code> (exclusive or)]] operation. <code>XOR</code> returns <code>1</code> [[if and only if]] an [[odd number]] of bits are <code>1</code>. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are <code>1</code>, the result will be a <code>0</code>, but if only one of them is <code>1</code>, the result will be <code>1</code>. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by <code>XOR</code>ing them with a <code>1</code>. If the original bit was <code>1</code>, it returns <code>1 XOR 1 = 0</code>. If the original bit was <code>0</code> it returns <code>0 XOR 1 = 1</code>. Also note that <code>XOR</code> masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because <code>Y XOR 0 = Y</code>, just like an <code>OR</code>.\n\nExample: Toggling bit values\n     10011101   10010101\n XOR '''00001111   11111111'''\n   = 10010010   01101010\n\nTo write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:\n\n   register = (register & ~bitmask) | value;\n\n==Uses of bitmasks==\n\n=== Arguments to functions ===\nIn programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]], bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API [[OpenGL]], there is a command, <code>glClear()</code> which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and [[stencil buffer]]s), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code.</source>\nwhich is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, <code>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT</code>, and <code>GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT</code> and <code>glClear()</code> is declared as\n<source lang=\"c\"> void glClear(GLbitfield bits);</source>\nThen a call to the function looks like this\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);</source>\nInternally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary <code>and</code> to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of <code>glClear()</code> might look like:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid glClear(GLbitfield bits) {\n  if ((bits & GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear color buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear depth buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear accumulation buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear stencil buffer.\n  }\n}</source>\nThe advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not [[type safety|type-safe]]. A <code>GLbitfield</code> is simply defined to be an <code>unsigned int</code>, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to <code>glClear(42)</code> or even <code>glClear(GL_POINTS)</code>. In [[C++]] an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library (see the external links for an example).\n\n===Inverse masks===\nMasks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address 209.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a [[wildcard mask]]. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a \"don't care\". This table further explains the concept.\n\nMask example:\n\nnetwork address (traffic that is to be processed) \t\n10.1.1.0\n\nmask\t\n0.0.0.255\n\nnetwork address (binary)\t\n00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000\n\nmask (binary)\t\n00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111\n\nBased on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets ([[Octet (computing)|octets]]) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of \"don't cares\" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is \"don't care\". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed.\n\nSubtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)\n\nACL equivalents\n\nThe source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means \"any\".\n\nThe source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as \"host 10.1.1.2\"\n\n===Image masks===\n{{see also|Bit blit|Clipping path}}\n[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\nIn [[computer graphics]], when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/19/mask-r-cnn-with-opencv/|title=Mask R-CNN with OpenCV|date=2018-11-19|website=PyImageSearch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> This way, for each intended image there are actually two [[bitmap]]s: the actual image, in which the  unused areas are given a [[pixel]] value with all [[bit]]s set to 0s, and an additional ''mask'', in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.\n\nAt [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the [[bitwise AND]] operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.\n\nThen, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise OR]] operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.\n\n[[Image:Sprite rendering by binary image mask.png|center]]\n\nThis technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s), for [[GUI]] [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, and for video titling and other image mixing applications.\n\nAlthough related (due to being used for the same purposes), [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[alpha channel]]s are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.\n\n===Hash tables===\nTo create a hashing function for a [[hash table]], often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.\n\nAn example of both modulo and masking in C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF;  // 2^32\n    const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10;  // 2^10\n    const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF;  // (2^10)-1\n\n    char **token_array = NULL;\n    // Handle memory allocation for token_array\u2026\n\n    char token[] = \"some hashable value\";\n    uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);\n\n    // Using modulo\n    size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;\n\n    // OR\n\n    // Using bitmask\n    size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK;\n\n    *(token_array+index) = token;\n\n    // Free the memory from token_array \u2026\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affinity mask]]\n*[[Bit field]]\n*[[Bit manipulation]]\n*[[Bitwise operation]]\n*[[Subnetwork]]\n*[[Tagged pointer]]\n*[[umask]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://bitbucket.org/fudepan/mili/wiki/BitwiseEnums bit_enum: a type-safe C++ library for bitwise operations]\n\n[[Category:Binary arithmetic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mask (Computing)}}\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=April 2020}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]]. Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.\n\n==Common bitmask functions==\n\n===Masking bits to <code>1</code>===\nTo turn certain bits on, the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise <code>OR</code>]] operation can be used, following [[Logical disjunction#Bitwise operation|the principle]] that <code>Y OR 1 = 1</code> and <code>Y OR 0 = Y</code>. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, <code>OR</code> can be used with a <code>1</code>. To leave a bit unchanged, <code>OR</code> is used with a <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''on'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n  OR '''1111'''0000   '''1111'''0000\n   = '''1111'''0101   '''1111'''0101\n\n===Masking bits to <code>0</code>===\nMore often in practice bits are \"masked ''off''\" (or masked to <code>0</code>) than \"masked ''on''\" (or masked to <code>1</code>). When a bit is <code>AND</code>ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. <code>Y AND 0 = 0</code>. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be <code>AND</code>ed with <code>1</code>, since <code>Y AND 1 = Y</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''off'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1010'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n AND '''0000'''1111   '''0000'''1111\n   = '''0000'''0101   '''0000'''0101\n\n===Querying the status of a bit===\nIt is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise <code>AND</code> is done as discussed [[#Masking bits to 0|above]] and the value is compared with <code>1</code>. If it is equal to <code>0</code>, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Querying the status of the 4th bit\n     1001'''1'''101   1001'''0'''101\n AND 0000'''1'''000   0000'''1'''000\n   = 0000'''1'''000   0000'''0'''000\n\n===Toggling bit values===\nSo far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the [[Exclusive or|<code>XOR</code> (exclusive or)]] operation. <code>XOR</code> returns <code>1</code> [[if and only if]] an [[odd number]] of bits are <code>1</code>. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are <code>1</code>, the result will be a <code>0</code>, but if only one of them is <code>1</code>, the result will be <code>1</code>. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by <code>XOR</code>ing them with a <code>1</code>. If the original bit was <code>1</code>, it returns <code>1 XOR 1 = 0</code>. If the original bit was <code>0</code> it returns <code>0 XOR 1 = 1</code>. Also note that <code>XOR</code> masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because <code>Y XOR 0 = Y</code>, just like an <code>OR</code>.\n\nExample: Toggling bit values\n     10011101   10010101\n XOR '''00001111   11111111'''\n   = 10010010   01101010\n\nTo write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:\n\n   register = (register & ~bitmask) | value;\n\n==Uses of bitmasks==\n\n=== Arguments to functions ===\nIn programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]], bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function.

The Pope arrived in the UK on Friday 28 May, and during his time there visited nine cities, delivering 16 major addresses. Among significant events were a meeting with [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], a joint service alongside the then-[[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Robert Runcie]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], meeting with and addressing the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] at [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|The Mound]], and five large open air [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es in [[London]], [[Coventry]], [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], and [[Cardiff]].

The Pope arrived in the UK on Friday 28 May, and during his time there visited nine cities, delivering 16 major addresses. Among significant events were a meeting with [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], a joint service alongside the then-[[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Robert Runcie]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], meeting with and addressing the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] at [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|The Mound]], and five large open air [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es in [[London]], [[Coventry]], [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], and [[Cardiff]]. Following his six-day visit which took him to locations in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], he returned to the Vatican on 2 June.\n\nUnlike the [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|2010 papal visit]] of his successor, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], John Paul II's was a pastoral rather than a [[state visit]], and was consequently funded by the Catholic Church in the UK rather than the Government. The trip was almost cancelled because Britain was then [[Falklands War|at war]] with [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina]], which had invaded the British possession of the [[Falkland Islands]]. This visit had to be balanced for fairness with an unscheduled trip to [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina]] that June. Over 2 million people attended events hosted by the Pope, with the visit said to be the biggest event for British Catholics since their emancipation.\n\n==Background==\nThe visit, the first to the United Kingdom made by a reigning pope,<ref name=Hirst/> was organised, and largely funded, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at an estimated cost of around \u00a37&nbsp;million (the equivalent of about \u00a320M in 2010).

Workmen's trains had been a feature of the line from the outset; they were the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's biggest source of revenue.{{sfn|Boyd|1988|p=88}} Such a service between Trawsfynydd and Blaenau Ffestiniog survived to the line's closure to passengers in 1960.{{sfn|Southern|1995|pp=15-17}}<ref>[http://www.2d53.co.uk/TT/TTBJBF60HMD1.htm 1960 [[Working timetable]], via ''2D53'']</ref> Up to 1930 at the earliest such services used dedicated, lower standard, coaches which used a specific siding at Blaenau where the men boarded from and alighted to the ballast.{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=13}}<ref>[http://www.s-r-s.org.uk/html/gww/S3293-2h.pdf Blaenau Ffestiniog (GWR) track layout] ''Signalling Record Society''</ref>\n\nThe line from Bala north to Trawsfynydd was designated in the restrictive \"Blue\" [[Great Western Railway Power and Weight Classification|weight limit]], with the section from Trawsfynydd to Blaenau limited even more tightly to \"Yellow\".{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=14}} The literature conjectures on overweight classes being used on troop trains, but no solid claim or photograph has been published. Only two steam age photos of the line show anything other than an 0-4-2 or 0-6-0 tank engine, they being of [[GWR 2251 Class]] 0-6-0s taken in the 1940s.{{sfn|Green|1996|p=40}}{{sfn|Southern|Leadbetter|Weatherley|1987|p=72}} As the 1950s passed [[GWR 5700 Class|\"5700\"]] and [[GWR 7400 Class|\"7400\"]] 0-6-PTs stole the show, exemplified by 9610 at Festiniog in the 1950s.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 36}} 0-4-2T engines \"..suffer[ed] from limited tank capacity and power.\"{{sfn|Boyd|1959|p=548}}\n\n==The halt in film==\nA mirror continuity sequence showing a train crossing the Teigl and reaching the halt features very briefly in an early Cold War spy film starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref>\"The Conspirator\", [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] 1949, 26 minutes from start</ref>\n\n== Closure and reopening ==\nBy the 1950s the line was deemed unremunerative. A survey undertaken in 1956 and 1957 found that the average daily numbers of passengers boarding and alighting were:\n\n*Blaenau Ffestiniog Central 62 and 65\n*Manod Halt 7 and 4\n*'''Teigl Halt 5 and 5'''\n*Festiniog 28 and 26\n*Maentwrog Road 8 and 6\n*Trawsfynydd Lake Halt 1 and 1\n*Trawsfynydd 28 and 24\n*Llafar Halt 2 and 2\n*Bryn-celynog Halt 2 and 2\n*Cwm Prysor Halt 3 and 3\n*Arenig 5 and 5\n*Capel Celyn Halt 7 and 8\n*Tyddyn Bridge Halt 4 and 6\n*Frongoch 18 and 15\n*Bala 65 and 58\n\nFreight traffic was not heavy, most arriving and leaving Bala did so from and to the south and that to Blaenau could be handled from the [[Conwy Valley Line]] northwards.\n\nIn 1957 Parliament authorised Liverpool Corporation to flood a section of the line by damming the [[Afon Tryweryn]]. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit.{{sfn|Morton Lloyd|1961|pp=270-1}} Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]] were to be catered for by building the long-discussed cross-town link between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were \u00a323,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and \u00a37000 in renewal charges.{{sfn|Coleford|2010b|pp=577-582}}\n\nThe halt closed in January 1960 but freight trains continued to pass the site for a further year. In 1964 the line, but not the halt, reopened from Blaenau southwards through the site of the halt to a siding near the site of {{rws|Trawsfynydd Lake Halt}} where a large (\"Goliath\") gantry{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 28}}{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=71}} was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]]. The main goods transported were [[nuclear fuel rod]]s carried in [[nuclear flask]]s. The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic to a siding at {{rws|Maentwrog Road}} serving the explosives factory in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]].{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 31}}\n\nPassenger trains briefly returned to the line in 1989, passing through to a temporary platform at {{rws|Maentwrog Road}}. These trains ran for one summer in an attempt to encourage tourism at the power station. Few people used the service to visit the power station, most riders travelled \"for the ride\", so the following year tourist trains drove to the line's terminus then reversed, with no-one getting on or off.<ref>[http://www.2d53.co.uk/blaenauffestiniog/Trawsfynydd%20Branch%202.htm Tourists trains to the station] ''2D53''</ref> This service lasted until the end of the 1990 Summer season.\n\nRail enthusiasts' special trains traversed the line from time to time. Notable examples were two \"last trains\". The first ran from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog and return on 22 January 1961{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=93}}<ref>[http://www.michaelclemensrailways.co.uk/?atk=476 Last train ticket] ''Michael Clemens''</ref> and in the post-1964 era the \"Trawsfynydd Lament\"<ref>[http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/eight.htm The Trawsfynydd Lament] ''Penmorfa''</ref> ran southwards to the limit of line at the power station loading point on 17 October 1998, the line having become redundant following removal of nuclear material from the power station.\n\n==The station site in the 21st Century==\n[[File:Teigl Halt, October 2016 (geograph 5166981).jpg|thumb|Geograph-5166981-the site of the halt in October 2016]]\nIn 2011 part of the platform edge remained. By October 2016 even that had disappeared, with only a low mound remaining under undergrowth to suggest the halt had ever existed, although the mothballed line still ran through the site to the former nuclear flask loading point.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127646831@N03/30423860602/in/album-72157675549800286/| title=Teigl Halt in 2016| website=flickr}}</ref>\n\n==The future==\nBetween 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the remaining line to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational [[Draisine|velorail]] track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry.{{sfn|Pagnamenta|2016|p=38}}\n\nTo considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of \nThe Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\" The company was quoted as saying \"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\"{{sfn|Crump|2016|p=15}} By mid-October 2016 the company had achieved six working days of track clearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traws-railway.co.uk/home/4592804748 |title=The railway's website |website=Traws-railway |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126002926/http://www.traws-railway.co.uk/home/4592804748 |archivedate=26 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{rail line\n|previous={{rws|Manod}}<br><small>Line mothballed, station closed</small>\n|next={{rws|Festiniog}}<br><small>Line mothballed, station closed</small>\n|route=[[Great Western Railway]]<br><small>[[Bala and Festiniog Railway]]</small>\n|col={{GWR colour}} }}\n{{end box}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1955===\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmlZFZGgMeM |title=Blaenau Ffestiniog Central, Junction (Stesion Fain) and North in 1955 |website=YouTube }}\n\n===Last train Special in 1961===\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rQyiIjxe0 |title=Tren st\u00eam olaf o'r Bala i Blaenau 1961 / Last train from Bala to Blaenau 1961 |website=YouTube }}\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt09amW1n9I |title=Last Train from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog 1961 |website=YouTube }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://player.bfi.org.uk/film/watch-the-last-train-to-blaenau-22161-1961/ |title=Last passenger train 1961 |website=BFI }}\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj2xdML-dHs |title=Bala -

This hut contained a telephone and key apparatus enabling staff to take safe possession of the line.{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=77}} When they were given permission to do so they manhandled the trolley onto the \"main line\", returning it the same way in due course.\n\nA short distance south of the trolley siding, in plain view from the station when looking along the sharply curved track, was the Pont Llefraith bridge over the Afon Teigl.<ref>[http://www.jaggers-heritage.com/resources/Section%2029.pdf Halt and bridge] ''Jaggers Heritage''</ref> This was replaced in the 1970s.<ref>[http://www.6g.nwrail.org.uk/alanhaywardpage3.html Bridge replacement near Teigl Halt] ''Alan Hayward''</ref> With a radius of just {{convert|7|ch|m}} the curve and a cutting obscured a northbound (\"Down\") driver's view of an occupation crossing a short distance north of the halt, so a bell operated by a treadle warned road users of a train's approach.{{sfn|Coleford|October 2010|p=512}}{{sfn|Boyd|1959|pp=547 & 549}}\n\n==Services==\nThe September 1959 timetable shows\n* Northbound\n** three trains calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Monday to Saturday\n** an extra evening train calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Saturday\n** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Bala to Trawsfynydd\n*** The journey time from Bala to the halt was around 69 minutes.\n* Southbound\n** three trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Monday to Saturday\n** two extra trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Saturday\n** an extra train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Trawsfynydd on Saturday evening\n** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala, except Llafar, Bryncelynog and Cwm Prysor Halts\n*** The journey time from Blaenau to the halt was around 11 minutes.\n* There was no Sunday service.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Preface}}\n\nIn 1935 the [[Ministry of Transport]] stated that the halt was used by 70 passengers per week.{{sfn|Coleford|October 2010|p=512}}\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]] at the latest most trains were composed of two carriages, with one regular turn comprising just one brake third coach. At least one train along the line regularly ran as a [[mixed train]],{{sfn|Christiansen|1976|p=71}} with a second between Bala and Arenig. By that time such trains had become rare on Britain's railways. Workmen's trains had been a feature of the line from the outset; they were the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's biggest source of revenue.{{sfn|Boyd|1988|p=88}} Such a service between Trawsfynydd and Blaenau Ffestiniog survived to the line's closure to passengers in 1960.{{sfn|Southern|1995|pp=15-17}}<ref>[http://www.2d53.co.uk/TT/TTBJBF60HMD1.htm 1960 [[Working timetable]], via ''2D53'']</ref> Up to 1930 at the earliest such services used dedicated, lower standard, coaches which used a specific siding at Blaenau where the men boarded from and alighted to the ballast.{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=13}}<ref>[http://www.s-r-s.org.uk/html/gww/S3293-2h.pdf Blaenau Ffestiniog (GWR) track layout] ''Signalling Record Society''</ref>\n\nThe line from Bala north to Trawsfynydd was designated in the restrictive \"Blue\" [[Great Western Railway Power and Weight Classification|weight limit]], with the section from Trawsfynydd to Blaenau limited even more tightly to \"Yellow\".{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=14}} The literature conjectures on overweight classes being used on troop trains, but no solid claim or photograph has been published. Only two steam age photos of the line show anything other than an 0-4-2 or 0-6-0 tank engine, they being of [[GWR 2251 Class]] 0-6-0s taken in the 1940s.{{sfn|Green|1996|p=40}}{{sfn|Southern|Leadbetter|Weatherley|1987|p=72}} As the 1950s passed [[GWR 5700 Class|\"5700\"]] and [[GWR 7400 Class|\"7400\"]] 0-6-PTs stole the show, exemplified by 9610 at Festiniog in the 1950s.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 36}} 0-4-2T engines \"..suffer[ed] from limited tank capacity and power.\"{{sfn|Boyd|1959|p=548}}\n\n==The halt in film==\nA mirror continuity sequence showing a train crossing the Teigl and reaching the halt features very briefly in an early Cold War spy film starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref>\"The Conspirator\", [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] 1949, 26 minutes from start</ref>\n\n== Closure and reopening ==\nBy the 1950s the line was deemed unremunerative. A survey undertaken in 1956 and 1957 found that the average daily numbers of passengers boarding and alighting were:\n\n*Blaenau Ffestiniog Central 62 and 65\n*Manod Halt 7 and 4\n*'''Teigl Halt 5 and 5'''\n*Festiniog 28 and 26\n*Maentwrog Road 8 and 6\n*Trawsfynydd Lake Halt 1 and 1\n*Trawsfynydd 28 and 24\n*Llafar Halt 2 and 2\n*Bryn-celynog Halt 2 and 2\n*Cwm Prysor Halt 3 and 3\n*Arenig 5 and 5\n*Capel Celyn Halt 7 and 8\n*Tyddyn Bridge Halt 4 and 6\n*Frongoch 18 and 15\n*Bala 65 and 58\n\nFreight traffic was not heavy, most arriving and leaving Bala did so from and to the south and that to Blaenau could be handled from the [[Conwy Valley Line]] northwards.\n\nIn 1957 Parliament authorised Liverpool Corporation to flood a section of the line by damming the [[Afon Tryweryn]]. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit.{{sfn|Morton Lloyd|1961|pp=270-1}} Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]] were to be catered for by building the long-discussed cross-town link between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were \u00a323,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and \u00a37000 in renewal charges.{{sfn|Coleford|2010b|pp=577-582}}\n\nThe halt closed in January 1960 but freight trains continued to pass the site for a further year. In 1964 the line, but not the halt, reopened from Blaenau southwards through the site of the halt to a siding near the site of {{rws|Trawsfynydd Lake Halt}} where a large (\"Goliath\") gantry{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 28}}{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=71}} was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]]. The main goods transported were [[nuclear fuel rod]]s carried in [[nuclear flask]]s. The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic to a siding at {{rws|Maentwrog Road}} serving the explosives factory in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]].{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2010|loc=Photo 31}}\n\nPassenger trains briefly returned to the line in 1989, passing through to a temporary platform at {{rws|Maentwrog Road}}. These trains ran for one summer in an attempt to encourage tourism at the power station. Few people used the service to visit the power station, most riders travelled \"for the ride\", so the following year tourist trains drove to the line's terminus then reversed, with no-one getting on or off.<ref>[http://www.2d53.co.uk/blaenauffestiniog/Trawsfynydd%20Branch%202.htm Tourists trains to the station] ''2D53''</ref> This service lasted until the end of the 1990 Summer season.\n\nRail enthusiasts' special trains traversed the line from time to time. Notable examples were two \"last trains\". The first ran from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog and return on 22 January 1961{{sfn|Southern|1995|p=93}}<ref>[http://www.michaelclemensrailways.co.uk/?atk=476 Last train ticket] ''Michael Clemens''</ref> and in the post-1964 era the \"Trawsfynydd Lament\"<ref>[http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/eight.htm The Trawsfynydd Lament] ''Penmorfa''</ref> ran southwards to the limit of line at the power station loading point on 17 October 1998, the line having become redundant following removal of nuclear material from the power station.\n\n==The station site in the 21st Century==\n[[File:Teigl Halt, October 2016 (geograph 5166981).jpg|thumb|Geograph-5166981-the site of the halt in October 2016]]\nIn 2011 part of the platform edge remained. By October 2016 even that had disappeared, with only a low mound remaining under undergrowth to suggest the halt had ever existed, although the mothballed line still ran through the site to the former nuclear flask loading point.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127646831@N03/30423860602/in/album-72157675549800286/| title=Teigl Halt in 2016| website=flickr}}</ref>\n\n==The future==\nBetween 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the remaining line to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational [[Draisine|velorail]] track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry.{{sfn|Pagnamenta|2016|p=38}}\n\nTo considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of \nThe Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\" The company was quoted as saying \"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\"{{sfn|Crump|2016|p=15}} By mid-October 2016 the company had achieved six working days of track clearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traws-railway.co.uk/home/4592804748 |title=The railway's website |website=Traws-railway |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126002926/http://www.traws-railway.co.uk/home/4592804748 |archivedate=26 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{rail line\n|previous={{rws|Manod}}<br><small>Line mothballed, station closed</small>\n|next={{rws|Festiniog}}<br><small>Line mothballed, station closed</small>\n|route=[[Great Western Railway]]<br><small>[[Bala and Festiniog Railway]]</small>\n|col={{GWR colour}} }}\n{{end box}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1955===\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmlZFZGgMeM |title=Blaenau Ffestiniog Central, Junction (Stesion Fain) and North in 1955 |website=YouTube }}\n\n===Last train Special in 1961===\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rQyiIjxe0 |title=Tren st\u00eam olaf o'r Bala i Blaenau 1961 / Last train from Bala to Blaenau 1961 |website=YouTube }}\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt09amW1n9I |title=Last Train from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog 1961 |website=YouTube }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://player.bfi.org.uk/film/watch-the-last-train-to-blaenau-22161-1961/ |title=Last passenger train 1961 |website=BFI }}\n*{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj2xdML-dHs |title=Bala -
