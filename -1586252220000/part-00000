Historically, the terms \"[[ham]]\" and \"bacon\" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel. Today, ham is defined as coming from the hind portion of the pig and brine specifically for curing ham includes a greater amount of sugar, while bacon is less sweet, though ingredients such as [[brown sugar]] or [[maple syrup]] are used for flavor.

Today, ham is defined as coming from the hind portion of the pig and brine specifically for curing ham includes a greater amount of sugar, while bacon is less sweet, though ingredients such as [[brown sugar]] or [[maple syrup]] are used for flavor.

The song initially leaked onto the internet in early October 2002 prior to the official release, prompting radio to play the track. It was released commercially as a [[Single (music)|single]] on October 22 by [[Maverick Records]] and was later included on the singer's ninth studio album, ''[[American Life]]'' (2003), and her greatest hits compilation, ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). Following the release of the previous Bond single, \"[[The World Is Not Enough (song)|The World Is Not Enough]]\", [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] wanted a high-profile artist for the theme of ''Die Another Day'', and Madonna was their choice. She wrote and produced the song with [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]] while French composer [[Michel Colombier]] was enlisted as composer.\n\nWhile developing, the track went through numerous changes. After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme, described as a metaphor for destroying one's ego. Ahmadza\u00ef re-arranged \"Die Another Day\" at his home in Paris while Colombier finished the string sections in Los Angeles. An [[electroclash]] number, \"Die Another Day\" is a mixture of strings and interpolating electronic swirls, and [[Stuttering|stuttered editing]] on Madonna's voice, cutting the main signal on the chorus.\n\n\"Die Another Day\" received mixed responses from [[Music journalism|music critics]]; one group of reviewers favored its departure from traditional Bond soundtracks, while others panned its production and called it uninteresting. It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] and two [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the top selling dance song in the US for both 2002 and 2003. \"Die Another Day\" reached the top of the charts in Canada, Italy, Romania and Spain and top-ten in a number of countries worldwide.\n\nThe [[music video]] was directed by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, and in the end she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of [[Judaism]] deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]] and again as a video interlude on the 2008\u201309 [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]].\n\n==Background and conception==\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], Madonna was in an introspective mood and started writing songs for her next studio album, ''[[American Life]]'', with producer [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]]. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]'' in [[Malta]], and also starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] play ''[[Up for Grabs (play)|Up For Grabs]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=368}}</ref> In the meantime, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) was filming the twentieth [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], ''[[Die Another Day]]'', directed by [[Lee Tamahori]]. The previous film in the franchise, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous [[The World Is Not Enough (song)|soundtrack single]] by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went to look for a high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for ''Die Another Day''.<ref name=\"jon1\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=277}}</ref>\n\nMadonna was their first choice, since she had been successful with soundtrack singles in the US, most recently with \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\" (1999) from ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' which was a top-twenty hit and earned her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]]. Anita Camrata, executive vice president of MGM Music explained the choice in 2002: \"With every other artist, you're taking a chance. But with Madonna, she has an extraordinary track record. She has written songs for films before and they were always perfect.\"<ref name=\"jon1\"/> By mid-February 2002 sources from the film set revealed that negotiations were under process for Madonna to sing the title song and make a cameo appearance in ''Die Another Day''. The song deal was confirmed in mid-March with journalists reporting a complex contract which might have cost MGM around one million dollars, including Madonna's fees for music and acting, promotion, the single release and the music video.<ref name=\"jon2\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=228}}</ref><ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452934/madonna-tapped-bond-theme.jhtml|title=Madonna Will 'Die' For James Bond Theme, Possible Cameo|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=March 15, 2002|accessdate=August 3, 2013|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}</ref> \"Die Another Day\" was officially released in United States on October 22, 2002.

Madonna and Ahmadza\u00ef went through their [[demo (music)|demo tracks]] for ''American Life'' and zeroed on one of the songs for the film. They sent the demo to MGM describing it as \"this techno thing, an electronica piece rewritten to accommodate the film and the title\". According to Colombier, the studio responded positively to the demo but wanted them to change it so that it blended with traditional [[James Bond music]] in some way.<ref name=\"jon2\"/>\n\nThe track went through various interpolations, according to [[executive producer]] of the film, [[Michael G. Wilson]]. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg had initially confirmed that the title of the song might not be same as the film, however Wilson explained that when the singer \"saw the rough [film] we were going to use, she sort of adapted the song and changed the title to 'Die Another Day'.\"<ref name=\"jon2\"/><ref name=\"mtv\"/> Tamahori was concerned with the demo since it did not appear expressive to him and there were abrupt endings. However he was satisfied when Madonna re-wrote the chorus to make it suitable for the film.<ref name=\"jon3\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=229}}</ref> The writing process was explained by Madonna:\n<blockquote>\nI hemmed and hawed about it for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right?

Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of ''Die Another Day''. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like \"I'm gonna destroy my ego ... [[Sigmund Freud]] ... Analyze this\" were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline.<ref name=\"jon3\"/> She told an interviewer from ''[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]'' magazine that the lyrics were about \"destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Body + Soul: Madonna|last=Ciccone|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Ciccone|date=September 2002|work=[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]|issn=1074-5246|page=85}}</ref> \"Die Another Day\" was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of ''American Life'' and was also featured on her third [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009).\n\n==Recording and composition==\nOnce the [[Song structure (popular music)|song structure]] was finished, MGM sent Colombier in Los Angeles a rough edit of the opening sequence of the film, while Ahmadza\u00ef sent him a longer version of the demo. Colombier had to create something inline the film score with \"Die Another Day\". He added some more lyrics and then went to London to conduct an ensemble of 60 [[string (music)|string]] players at [[AIR Studios#AIR Lyndhurst Hall|AIR Lyndhurst Studios]].<ref name=\"jon2\"/> Ahmadza\u00ef, who was already [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] the other tracks for ''American Life'', explained that the process \"was often laborious but with a less-is-more philosophy that is reflected in the music's sparse arrangements.\" They wanted minimalist production for the song, but at the same time make them sound \"futuristic\".<ref name=\"emu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/covert-operation/137953|title=Covert Operation|date=June 1, 2003|accessdate=February 23, 2013|last=Micallef|first=Ken|work=[[Electronic Musician]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030618204359/http://remixmag.com/ar/remix_covert_operation/index.htm|archivedate=June 18, 2003}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Madonna-die another day.ogg\n| title       = \"Die Another Day\"\n| description = A 20 second from \"Die Another Day\", where Madonna is heard singing the chorus.

The team was in [[Prague]], shooting a music video for [[The Prodigy]]. \"We thought it was a joke, since the letter was long and handwritten. But the song sounded suspiciously like her,\" Sanders explained. He was then asked to go to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London to watch a half-finished version of the Bond film with producer [[Barbara Broccoli]]. Later, Sanders and one of his colleagues invited Madonna to their London home to discuss the video.<ref name=\"dagon\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2002/09/03/347734.html|title=Madonna valgte Ole|trans-title=Madonna Chooses Ole|last=Fossum|first=Tommy|date=September 3, 2002|accessdate=August 31, 2013|work=[[Dagbladet]]}}</ref> By summer 2002, he had compiled the idea for the video with Madonna's inputs in it:\n<blockquote>\nWe received daily e-mails with feedback that was concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, and it was clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.<ref name=\"dagon\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe video was developed as an independent Madonna clip devoid of any footage from the Bond film, but was still Bond-inspired. It portrayed Madonna in a torture chamber as a prisoner and also fight sequences where the singer duels with herself.<ref name=\"dagon\"/> Post-production and [[visual effects]] for the video was done by London's [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC). They created \"invisible\" effects for the fighting sequences, allowing Madonna to shoot two characters. Traktor explained that every shot of the video used some visual effects, co-ordinated by the group's lead artist, Christophe Allender. The directors did not want to use too many shots for the dueling scenes, which they believed would have restricted their creative freedom. Additional post-production effects included composing the fight sequence as a cohesive theme, adding blood to the wounds inflicted on Madonna, and adding digital stills of windows against the [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] where the shots were taken. The final shot showed the characteristic [[Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)|gun barrel sequence]] from the Bond films. MPC artist Ziggy Zigouras used a [[2K resolution]] shot and tailored it according to Traktor's specifications.

She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captors laugh at her. An alternate scene shows two people [[fencing]] inside a white lit chamber, one in black cloths and one in white. Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing. As she repeats the words \"Sigmund Freud\", the soldiers catch her again and [[Water torture|douse her head in icy-water]].\n\nThe two people fencing take off their masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] surprised to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films are present in the room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an [[electric chair]].\n\nAs the [[break (music)|breakdown]] happens, the soldiers bind her on the chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a [[speargun]] and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters ('''\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5''') being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see a vision of a bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.<ref name=\"jjj\"/>\n\n===Reception and analysis===\nAccording to author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, the video employed an identity-splitting strategy in which the two Madonnas fight each other. With this she was referencing her previous videos where such tactics have been employed, like the one for \"Music\", \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\" and \"[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=85}}</ref> Joanna Rydzewska, one of the authors of the book ''Representing Gender In Cultures'' analyzed that the violent imagery in the video was Madonna's way of portraying the violence she had faced during her \"tumultuous\" marriage with actor [[Sean Penn]]; she added that the video was a contrast to the \"tremendously independent artist she is\".<ref>{{harvnb|H.

The song initially leaked onto the internet in early October 2002 prior to the official release, prompting radio to play the track. It was released commercially as a [[Single (music)|single]] on October 22 by [[Maverick Records]] and was later included on the singer's ninth studio album, ''[[American Life]]'' (2003), and her greatest hits compilation, ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). Following the release of the previous Bond single, \"[[The World Is Not Enough (song)|The World Is Not Enough]]\", [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] wanted a high-profile artist for the theme of ''Die Another Day'', and Madonna was their choice. She wrote and produced the song with [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]] while French composer [[Michel Colombier]] was enlisted as composer.\n\nWhile developing, the track went through numerous changes. After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme, described as a metaphor for destroying one's ego. Ahmadza\u00ef re-arranged \"Die Another Day\" at his home in Paris while Colombier finished the string sections in Los Angeles. An [[electroclash]] number, \"Die Another Day\" is a mixture of strings and interpolating electronic swirls, and [[Stuttering|stuttered editing]] on Madonna's voice, cutting the main signal on the chorus.\n\n\"Die Another Day\" received mixed responses from [[Music journalism|music critics]]; one group of reviewers favored its departure from traditional Bond soundtracks, while others panned its production and called it uninteresting. It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] and two [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the top selling dance song in the US for both 2002 and 2003. \"Die Another Day\" reached the top of the charts in Canada, Italy, Romania and Spain and top-ten in a number of countries worldwide.\n\nThe [[music video]] was directed by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, and in the end she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of [[Judaism]] deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]] and again as a video interlude on the 2008\u201309 [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]].\n\n==Background and conception==\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], Madonna was in an introspective mood and started writing songs for her next studio album, ''[[American Life]]'', with producer [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]]. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]'' in [[Malta]], and also starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] play ''[[Up for Grabs (play)|Up For Grabs]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=368}}</ref> In the meantime, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) was filming the twentieth [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], ''[[Die Another Day]]'', directed by [[Lee Tamahori]]. The previous film in the franchise, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous [[The World Is Not Enough (song)|soundtrack single]] by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went to look for a high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for ''Die Another Day''.<ref name=\"jon1\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=277}}</ref>\n\nMadonna was their first choice, since she had been successful with soundtrack singles in the US, most recently with \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\" (1999) from ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' which was a top-twenty hit and earned her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]]. Anita Camrata, executive vice president of MGM Music explained the choice in 2002: \"With every other artist, you're taking a chance. But with Madonna, she has an extraordinary track record. She has written songs for films before and they were always perfect.\"<ref name=\"jon1\"/> By mid-February 2002 sources from the film set revealed that negotiations were under process for Madonna to sing the title song and make a cameo appearance in ''Die Another Day''. The song deal was confirmed in mid-March with journalists reporting a complex contract which might have cost MGM around one million dollars, including Madonna's fees for music and acting, promotion, the single release and the music video.<ref name=\"jon2\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=228}}</ref><ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452934/madonna-tapped-bond-theme.jhtml|title=Madonna Will 'Die' For James Bond Theme, Possible Cameo|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=March 15, 2002|accessdate=August 3, 2013|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}</ref> \"Die Another Day\" was officially released in United States on October 22, 2002. It was supposed to be released on October 10, but got leaked a week prior to that to the radio stations.

Madonna and Ahmadza\u00ef went through their [[demo (music)|demo tracks]] for ''American Life'' and zeroed on one of the songs for the film. They sent the demo to MGM describing it as \"this techno thing, an electronica piece rewritten to accommodate the film and the title\". According to Colombier, the studio responded positively to the demo but wanted them to change it so that it blended with traditional [[James Bond music]] in some way.<ref name=\"jon2\"/>\n\nThe track went through various interpolations, according to [[executive producer]] of the film, [[Michael G. Wilson]]. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg had initially confirmed that the title of the song might not be same as the film, however Wilson explained that when the singer \"saw the rough [film] we were going to use, she sort of adapted the song and changed the title to 'Die Another Day'.\"<ref name=\"jon2\"/><ref name=\"mtv\"/> Tamahori was concerned with the demo since it did not appear expressive to him and there were abrupt endings. However he was satisfied when Madonna re-wrote the chorus to make it suitable for the film.<ref name=\"jon3\">{{harvnb|Burlingame|2012|p=229}}</ref> The writing process was explained by Madonna:\n<blockquote>\nI hemmed and hawed about it for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right?

Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of ''Die Another Day''. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like \"I'm gonna destroy my ego ... [[Sigmund Freud]] ... Analyze this\" were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline.<ref name=\"jon3\"/> She told an interviewer from ''[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]'' magazine that the lyrics were about \"destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Body + Soul: Madonna|last=Ciccone|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Ciccone|date=September 2002|work=[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]|issn=1074-5246|page=85}}</ref> \"Die Another Day\" was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of ''American Life'' and was also featured on her third [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009).\n\n==Recording and composition==\nOnce the [[Song structure (popular music)|song structure]] was finished, MGM sent Colombier in Los Angeles a rough edit of the opening sequence of the film, while Ahmadza\u00ef sent him a longer version of the demo. Colombier had to create something inline the film score with \"Die Another Day\". He added some more lyrics and then went to London to conduct an ensemble of 60 [[string (music)|string]] players at [[AIR Studios#AIR Lyndhurst Hall|AIR Lyndhurst Studios]].<ref name=\"jon2\"/> Ahmadza\u00ef, who was already [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] the other tracks for ''American Life'', explained that the process \"was often laborious but with a less-is-more philosophy that is reflected in the music's sparse arrangements.\" They wanted minimalist production for the song, but at the same time make them sound \"futuristic\".<ref name=\"emu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/covert-operation/137953|title=Covert Operation|date=June 1, 2003|accessdate=February 23, 2013|last=Micallef|first=Ken|work=[[Electronic Musician]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030618204359/http://remixmag.com/ar/remix_covert_operation/index.htm|archivedate=June 18, 2003}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Madonna-die another day.ogg\n| title       = \"Die Another Day\"\n| description = A 20 second from \"Die Another Day\", where Madonna is heard singing the chorus.

Sixty real strings, played live, became audio files in his computer. They can be chopped like real pieces of fabric. He's amazingly brilliant with that,\" concluded Colombier. Madonna attended the recording sessions at [[Olympic Studios]] in London. There was a [[tango]] section in the song which Colombier recalled was composed perfectly during rehearsals.

She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, and it was clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.<ref name=\"dagon\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe video was developed as an independent Madonna clip devoid of any footage from the Bond film, but was still Bond-inspired. It portrayed Madonna in a torture chamber as a prisoner and also fight sequences where the singer duels with herself.<ref name=\"dagon\"/> Post-production and [[visual effects]] for the video was done by London's [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC). They created \"invisible\" effects for the fighting sequences, allowing Madonna to shoot two characters. Traktor explained that every shot of the video used some visual effects, co-ordinated by the group's lead artist, Christophe Allender. The directors did not want to use too many shots for the dueling scenes, which they believed would have restricted their creative freedom. Additional post-production effects included composing the fight sequence as a cohesive theme, adding blood to the wounds inflicted on Madonna, and adding digital stills of windows against the [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] where the shots were taken. The final shot showed the characteristic [[Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)|gun barrel sequence]] from the Bond films. MPC artist Ziggy Zigouras used a [[2K resolution]] shot and tailored it according to Traktor's specifications.

She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captors laugh at her. An alternate scene shows two people [[fencing]] inside a white lit chamber, one in black cloths and one in white. Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing. As she repeats the words \"Sigmund Freud\", the soldiers catch her again and [[Water torture|douse her head in icy-water]].\n\nThe two people fencing take off their masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] surprised to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films are present in the room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an [[electric chair]].\n\nAs the [[break (music)|breakdown]] happens, the soldiers bind her on the chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a [[speargun]] and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters ('''\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5''') being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see a vision of a bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.<ref name=\"jjj\"/>\n\n===Reception and analysis===\nAccording to author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, the video employed an identity-splitting strategy in which the two Madonnas fight each other. With this she was referencing her previous videos where such tactics have been employed, like the one for \"Music\", \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\" and \"[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=85}}</ref> Joanna Rydzewska, one of the authors of the book ''Representing Gender In Cultures'' analyzed that the violent imagery in the video was Madonna's way of portraying the violence she had faced during her \"tumultuous\" marriage with actor [[Sean Penn]]; she added that the video was a contrast to the \"tremendously independent artist she is\".<ref>{{harvnb|H.

Bowheads originally crossed ice-covered inlets and straits to exchange genes between Atlantic and Pacific populations. This conclusion was derived from analyzing maternal lineage using [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Whaling and climatic cooling during the [[Little Ice Age]], from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity.<ref>{{cite news |last=Eilperin |first=Juliet |date=18 October 2012 |title=Bowhead whales lost genetic diversity, study shows |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/bowhead-whales-lost-genetic-diversity-study-shows/2012/10/18/8b0324d0-186c-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html?wprss=rss_health-science&tid=pp_widget}}</ref>\n\nA 2013 discovery has clarified the function of the bowhead's large palatal [[Rete mirabile#Fish|retial]] organ. The bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, the ''corpus cavernosum maxillaris'', extends along the centre of the hard plate, forming two large lobes at the rostral palate. The tissue is histologically similar to that of the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] of the mammalian [[penis]]. It is hypothesized that this organ provides a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected from the cold Arctic waters by {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to prevent [[hyperthermia]] (and ultimately brain damage). It is believed that this organ becomes engorged with blood, causing the whale to open its mouth to allow cold seawater to flow over the organ, thus cooling the blood.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Ford Jr | first1 = T.

Whaling and climatic cooling during the [[Little Ice Age]], from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity.<ref>{{cite news |last=Eilperin |first=Juliet |date=18 October 2012 |title=Bowhead whales lost genetic diversity, study shows |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/bowhead-whales-lost-genetic-diversity-study-shows/2012/10/18/8b0324d0-186c-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html?wprss=rss_health-science&tid=pp_widget}}</ref>\n\nA 2013 discovery has clarified the function of the bowhead's large palatal [[Rete mirabile#Fish|retial]] organ. The bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, the ''corpus cavernosum maxillaris'', extends along the centre of the hard plate, forming two large lobes at the rostral palate. The tissue is histologically similar to that of the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] of the mammalian [[penis]]. It is hypothesized that this organ provides a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected from the cold Arctic waters by {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to prevent [[hyperthermia]] (and ultimately brain damage). It is believed that this organ becomes engorged with blood, causing the whale to open its mouth to allow cold seawater to flow over the organ, thus cooling the blood.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Ford Jr | first1 = T.

During 1858\u20131860, the ships shifted back to the Bering Strait region, where the majority of the fleet would cruise during the summer up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Bockstoce1986\">{{cite book |last=Bockstoce |first=John |title=Whales, Ice, & Men: The History of Whaling in the Western Arctic |url=https://archive.org/details/whalesicemenhist0000bock |url-access=registration |year=1986 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-97447-7 }}</ref> An estimated 18,600 bowheads were killed in the Bering Strait region between 1848 and 1914, with 60% of the total being reached within the first two decades.
