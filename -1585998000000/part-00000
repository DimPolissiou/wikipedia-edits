Relays tend to be of lower capacity and are usually designed for both ''normally closed'' and ''normally open'' applications. Devices switching more than 15 amperes or in circuits rated more than a few kilowatts are usually called contactors. Apart from optional auxiliary low-current contacts, contactors are almost exclusively fitted with normally open (\"form A\") contacts. Unlike relays, contactors are designed with features to control and suppress the arc produced when interrupting heavy motor currents.\n\nContactors come in many forms with varying capacities and features. Unlike a [[circuit breaker]], a contactor is not intended to interrupt a [[short circuit]] current. Contactors range from those having a breaking current of several amperes to thousands of amperes and 24 V DC to many kilovolts. The physical size of contactors ranges from a device small enough to pick up with one hand, to large devices approximately a meter (yard) on a side.\n\nContactors are used to control [[electric motor]]s, [[electric lighting|lighting]], [[electric heating|heating]], [[capacitor]] banks, thermal evaporators, and other electrical loads.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:AlbrightSW200A-675.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Albright [[Relay#Pole and throw|SPST]] DC contactor,<br>used in industrial electric vehicles and sometimes used in [[Electric vehicle]] (EV) conversions]]\n[[File:Pneumatic by-passing contactors of electric locomotive VL11.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Powerful DC contactor with electro-pneumatic drive]]\nA contactor has three components. The ''contacts'' are the current-carrying part of the contactor. This includes power contacts, auxiliary contacts, and contact springs. The ''electromagnet'' (or \"''coil''\") provides the driving force to close the contacts. The ''enclosure'' is a frame housing the contacts and the electromagnet. Enclosures are made of insulating materials such as [[Bakelite]], [[Nylon 6]], and [[thermosetting plastic]]s to protect and insulate the contacts and to provide some measure of protection against personnel touching the contacts. Open-frame contactors may have a further enclosure to protect against dust, oil, explosion hazards and weather.\n\n{{anchor|blowout}}\n''Magnetic blowouts'' use blowout coils to lengthen and move the [[electric arc]]. These are especially useful in DC power circuits. AC arcs have periods of low current, during which the arc can be extinguished with relative ease, but DC arcs have continuous high current, so blowing them out requires the arc to be stretched further than an AC arc of the same current. The magnetic blowouts in the pictured Albright contactor (which is designed for DC currents) more than double the current the contactor can break, increasing it from 600&nbsp;A to 1,500&nbsp;A.\n\nSometimes an economizer circuit is also installed to reduce the power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save a substantial amount of power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils.\n\nA basic contactor will have a coil input (which may be driven by either an AC or DC supply depending on the contactor design). Universal coils (driven by AC as well as DC) are also available in the market today<ref>Electrical Classroom,[https://www.electricalclassroom.com/contactor-construction-operation-application-and-selection], Contactor \u2013 Construction, Operation, Application and Selection</ref>. The coil may be energized at the same voltage as a motor the contactor is controlling, or may be separately controlled with a lower coil voltage better suited to control by [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]] and lower-voltage pilot devices. Certain contactors have series coils connected in the motor circuit; these are used, for example, for automatic acceleration control, where the next stage of resistance is not cut out until the motor current has dropped.<ref>{{harvnb|Croft|Summers|1987|loc=p.&nbsp;7-125<!--hyphenated page-->}}</ref>\n\n==Operating principle==\nWhen current passes through the [[electromagnet]], a magnetic field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The electromagnet coil draws more current initially, until its [[inductance]] increases when the metal core enters the coil. The moving contact is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the electromagnet holds the moving and fixed contacts together. When the contactor coil is de-energized, gravity or a spring returns the electromagnet core to its initial position and opens the contacts.\n\nFor contactors energized with [[alternating current]], a small part of the core is surrounded with a shading coil, which slightly delays the magnetic flux in the core. The effect is to average out the alternating pull of the magnetic field and so prevent the core from buzzing at twice line frequency.\n\nBecause arcing and consequent damage occurs just as the contacts are opening or closing, contactors are designed to open and close very rapidly; there is often an internal [[Tipping point (physics)|tipping point mechanism]] to ensure rapid action.\n\nRapid closing can, however, lead to increase [[Switches#Contact bounce|contact bounce]] which causes additional unwanted open-close cycles.  One solution is to have [[Electrical contacts#Bifurcated contact|bifurcated contacts]] to minimize contact bounce; two contacts designed to close simultaneously, but bounce at different times so the circuit will not be briefly disconnected and cause an arc.\n\nA slight variant has multiple contacts designed to engage in rapid succession. The first to make contact and last to break will experience the greatest contact wear and will form a high-resistance connection that would cause excessive heating inside the contactor.  However, in doing so, it will protect the primary contact from arcing, so a low contact resistance will be established a millisecond later. This technique is only effective if the conctactors disengage in reverse order that they engaged. Otherwise the damaging effect of arcing will be split evenly across both contactors. {{Citation Needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAnother technique for improving the life of contactors is [[Electrical contacts#Contact wipe|contact wipe]]; the contacts move past each other after initial contact in order to wipe off any contamination.\n\n==Arc suppression==\n{{main|Arc suppression}}\nWithout adequate [[contact protection]], the occurrence of [[electric arc|electric current arcing]] causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant damage. An electrical arc occurs between the two contact points (electrodes) when they transition from a closed to an open (break arc) or from an open to a closed (make arc). The break arc is typically more energetic and thus more destructive.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ragnar  |last=Holm |title=Electric Contacts Handbook |pages=331\u2013342 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin / G\u00f6ttingen / Heidelberg |year=1958 |edition=3rd |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThe heat developed by the resulting electrical arc is very high, ultimately causing the metal on the contact to migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc (tens of thousands of degrees Celsius) cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating [[ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This activity causes the material in the contacts to degrade over time, ultimately resulting in device failure. For example, a properly applied contactor will have a life span of 10,000 to 100,000 operations when run under power; which is significantly less than the mechanical (non-powered) life of the same device which can be in excess of 20 million operations.<ref>{{cite web |id=Lab Note #105 |title=Contact Life: Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing |author=  |publisher=Arc Suppression Technologies |date=April 2011 |url=http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ |accessdate = February 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost motor control contactors at low voltages (600 volts and less) are air break contactors; air at atmospheric pressure surrounds the contacts and extinguishes the arc when interrupting the circuit. Modern medium-voltage AC motor controllers use vacuum contactors. High voltage AC contactors (greater than 1,000 volts) may use vacuum or an inert gas around the contacts.  High voltage DC contactors (greater than 600 V) still rely on air within specially designed arc-chutes to break the arc energy.  High-voltage electric locomotives may be isolated from their overhead supply by roof-mounted [[Circuit breaker#High-voltage circuit breakers|circuit breakers]] actuated by compressed air; the same air supply may be used to \"blow out\" any arc that forms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hammond |first=Rolt |title=Modern Methods of Railway Operation |publisher=Frederick Muller |location=London |year=1968|pages=71\u201373 |chapter=Development of electric traction|oclc=467723}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ransome-Wallis |first=Patrick |title= Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Railway Locomotives |publisher= Hutchinson |location=London |year=1959 |page=173 |chapter= Electric motive power |oclc= 2683266 |isbn=0-486-41247-4}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings==\nContactors are rated by designed load current per contact (pole),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/chpt_5/2.html |title= All about circuits |publisher= All about circuits |date= |accessdate= 2013-09-18}}</ref> maximum fault withstand current, duty cycle, design life expectancy, voltage, and coil voltage.

Example [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] categories in standard 60947 are described as:\n* '''AC-1''' - Non-inductive or slightly inductive loads, resistance furnaces\n* '''AC-2''' - Starting of [[Wound rotor motor|slip-ring motor]]s: starting, switching-off\n* '''AC-3''' - Starting of [[Squirrel-cage rotor|squirrel-cage motors]] and switching-off only after the motor is up to speed.

NEMA standard contactor sizes are designated 00, 0, 1, 2, 3 to 9.\n\nThe horsepower ratings are based on voltage and on typical induction motor characteristics and [[duty cycle]] as stated in NEMA standard ICS2. Exceptional duty cycles or specialized motor types may require a different NEMA starter size than the nominal rating. Manufacturer's literature is used to guide selection for non-motor loads, for example, incandescent lighting or power factor correction capacitors.  Contactors for medium-voltage motors (greater than 1,000 volts) are rated by voltage and current capacity.\n\nAuxiliary contacts of contactors are used in control circuits and are rated with [[NEMA contact ratings]] for the pilot circuit duty required.  Normally these contacts are not used in motor circuits. The nomenclature is a letter followed by a three-digit number, the letter designates the current rating of the contacts and the current type (i.e., AC or DC) and the number designates the maximum voltage design values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moellercatalog.com/Documents/Chapter_14/14016_17.pdf |format=PDF |page=4/16 |title=General Information / Technical Data NEMA / EEMAC Ratings | publisher=Moeller | via=KMParts.com |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Lighting control===\nContactors are often used to provide central control of large lighting installations, such as an office building or retail building. To reduce power consumption in the contactor coils, latching contactors are used, which have two operating coils. One coil, momentarily energized, closes the power circuit contacts, which are then mechanically held closed; the second coil opens the contacts.\n\n===Magnetic starter===\n{{Main|Magnetic starter}}\nA '''magnetic starter''' is a device designed to provide power to electric motors.  It includes a contactor as an essential component, while also providing power-cutoff, under-voltage,  and overload protection.\n\n===Vacuum contactor===\nVacuum contactors utilize vacuum bottle encapsulated contacts to suppress the arc. This arc suppression allows the contacts to be much smaller and use less space than air break contacts at higher currents. As the contacts are encapsulated, vacuum contactors are used fairly extensively in dirty applications, such as mining. Vacuum contactors are also widely used at medium voltages from 1000-5000 volts, effectively displacing oil-filled [[circuit breaker]]s in many applications.\n\nVacuum contactors are only applicable for use in AC systems. The AC arc generated upon opening of the contacts will self-extinguish at the zero-crossing of the current waveform, with the vacuum preventing a re-strike of the arc across the open contacts.  Vacuum contactors are therefore very efficient at disrupting the energy of an electric arc and are used when relatively fast switching is required, as the maximum break time is determined by the periodicity of the AC waveform. In the case of 60&nbsp;Hz power (North American standard), the power will discontinue within 1/120 or 0.008333 of a second.\n\n===Mercury relay===\nA [[mercury relay]], sometimes called a mercury displacement relay, or, mercury contactor, is a relay that uses the liquid metal mercury in an insulated sealed container as the switching element.\n\n===Mercury-wetted relay===\nA [[mercury-wetted relay]] is a form of relay, usually a [[reed relay]], in which the contacts are wetted with mercury. These are not considered contactors because they are not intended for currents above 15 amps.\n\n==Camshaft operation==\nWhen a series of contactors is to be operated in sequence, this may be done by a [[camshaft]] instead of by individual electromagnets.  The camshaft may be driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic cylinder. Before the advent of [[solid-state electronics]], the camshaft system was commonly used for speed control in [[electric locomotive]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=n.d. |title=Electric Locomotives |url=http://www.railway-technical.com/trains/rolling-stock-index-l/electric-locomotives.html |publisher=The Railway Technical Website}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between a relay and a contactor==\nIn addition to their current ratings and rating for motor circuit control, contactors often have other construction details not found in relays.  Unlike lower-powered relays, contactors generally have special structures for arc-suppression to allow them to interrupt heavy currents, such as motor starting inrush current.  Contactors usually have provision for installation of additional contact blocks, rated for pilot duty, used in motor control circuits.\n* It is rare to see high coil voltages for relays but often found with contactors with coil voltages from 24 V AC/DC all the way up to 600 V AC possible\n* Relays often have normally closed contacts; contactors usually do not (when de-energized, there is no connection).\n* Combination motor starters only use contactors\n* For low voltages Switching times are much faster for relays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myelectricsparks.com/2020/03/what-is-contactor-and-its-types.html|title=What is Contactor its types and applications|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Contactors}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:NEMA standards]]\n[[Category:Relays]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Electronic circuit element serving as a switch}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Contactor.jpg|250px|right|thumb|AC contactor for pump application.]]\n:''In '''semiconductor testing''', '''contactor''' can also refer to the specialized socket that connects the [[device under test]].''\n:''In process industries, a '''contactor''' is a vessel where two streams interact, for example, air and liquid.

In the case of 60&nbsp;Hz power (North American standard), the power will discontinue within 1/120 or 0.008333 of a second.\n\n===Mercury relay===\nA [[mercury relay]], sometimes called a mercury displacement relay, or, mercury contactor, is a relay that uses the liquid metal mercury in an insulated sealed container as the switching element.\n\n===Mercury-wetted relay===\nA [[mercury-wetted relay]] is a form of relay, usually a [[reed relay]], in which the contacts are wetted with mercury. These are not considered contactors because they are not intended for currents above 15 amps.\n\n==Camshaft operation==\nWhen a series of contactors is to be operated in sequence, this may be done by a [[camshaft]] instead of by individual electromagnets.  The camshaft may be driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic cylinder. Before the advent of [[solid-state electronics]], the camshaft system was commonly used for speed control in [[electric locomotive]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=n.d. |title=Electric Locomotives |url=http://www.railway-technical.com/trains/rolling-stock-index-l/electric-locomotives.html |publisher=The Railway Technical Website}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between a relay and a contactor==\nIn addition to their current ratings and rating for motor circuit control, contactors often have other construction details not found in relays.  Unlike lower-powered relays, contactors generally have special structures for arc-suppression to allow them to interrupt heavy currents, such as motor starting inrush current.  Contactors usually have provision for installation of additional contact blocks, rated for pilot duty, used in motor control circuits.\n* It is rare to see high coil voltages for relays but often found with contactors with coil voltages from 24 V AC/DC all the way up to 600 V AC possible\n* Relays often have normally closed contacts; contactors usually do not (when de-energized, there is no connection).\n* Combination motor starters only use contactors\n* Switching times are much faster for relays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myelectricsparks.com/2020/03/what-is-contactor-and-its-types.html|title=What is Contactor its types and applications|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Contactors}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:NEMA standards]]\n[[Category:Relays]]\n", "name_user": "Electricsparks", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDifferences between a relay and a contactor", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactor"}

The animals are kept in their near natural habitat. Most of the animals are either orphaned brought from various parts of the state or those, which are exchanged from other zoos. No animal is deliberately captured from the forest.[1] Van Vihar is unique because it allows easy access to the visitors through a road passing through the park, security of animals assured from poachers by building trenches and walls, chain-link fence and by providing natural habitat to the animals.\n\n=== Activity centres ===\nThe [[Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya|Museum of Mankind]] in Bhopal exhibits tribal and folk houses from all corners of India.<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/museum-of-mankind-bhopal-relocates-tribal-houses-across-india/1/155488.html A House of Tribal Tradition- Bhopal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012955/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/museum-of-mankind-bhopal-relocates-tribal-houses-across-india/1/155488.html |date=9 May 2015 }} India Today</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==People from Bhopal==\n\n=== Politics, Civil Service, Science ===\n\n*[[Shankar Dayal Sharma]] \u2013 9th [[President of India]]\n*[[Najma Heptulla]] \u2013 Union Minister\n*[[Raghuram Rajan]] \u2013 23rd Governor Of RBI\n*[[Kailash Chandra Joshi]] \u2013 Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh\n*[[Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah]] \u2013 Revolutionary\n*[[Munshi Hakimuddin]] -

{"title_page": "Tales of the Jedi", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Tales of the Jedi''}}\n[[File:Totj kotor1.jpg|thumb|[[Dave Dorman]]'s cover art for the first issue of ''Tales of the Jedi''. Later issues in the initial story arc were subtitled ''Knights of the Old Republic''.]]\n\n'''''Tales of the Jedi''''' is a series of comic books published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] between 1993 and 1998. They are part of the fictional [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], and cover the [[Great Sith War]] and the [[Great Hyperspace War]]. The series represented the earliest chronological ''Star Wars'' stories until the publication of the ''[[Dawn of the Jedi]]'' series of comics and novels.\n\nThe first books released covered the Great Sith War (4,000 BBY, or Before the [[Battle of Yavin]]). The latter were prequels that covered the Great Hyperspace War, which happened a thousand years earlier.\n\n==Summary==\nThe [[Great Hyperspace War]] was instigated when two [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] hyperspace explorers accidentally crash-landed on the [[Sith]] graveyard planet [[Korriban]] during the funeral procession of Marka Ragnos.  His successor, [[List of minor Sith characters#Sadow, Naga|Naga Sadow]], provoked war with the Republic, and installed himself as the leader of the [[Sith Empire]].  He fought not only the Republic, but the forces of his chief rival, Ludo Kressh, and was forced to destroy his own fleet to cover his escape.  Sadow landed on [[Yavin IV]] and constructed vast temples with the labor of his [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Massassi|Massassi]] warriors.\n\nSix hundred years later, fallen [[Jedi]] Freedon Nadd arrived on Yavin IV, and learned Sith sorcery from the spirit of Naga Sadow.  He took his knowledge and the treasures of Sadow to the planet [[Onderon]], where he used his acquired gifts to install himself as [[monarch|king]].  His spirit continued to advise his descendants.\n\nAnother Jedi, [[Ulic Qel-Droma]], was sent to Onderon to mediate a conflict, where he met the spirit of Freedon Nadd, who told him he would become a Sith Lord.  The prophecy came true when the Krath, a secret dark side society, attacked the Republic and injured Ulic with alchemically-treated shrapnel, and then injected him with dark side poisons that would ensure his fall.\n\n[[Exar Kun]] left his master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, because his master would not let him learn about the dark side.  He went to Onderon, where he learned of Freedon Nadd's tomb.  Nadd's spirit told him to go to Korriban, where Nadd tricked him into accepting the dark side.  They went to Yavin IV, where Nadd gave him a choice: surrender to the dark side, or die.  Kun chose life.  After learning about the dark side from Nadd, Kun destroyed him with a dark side amulet.\n\nExar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma met on Cinnagar, and their battle was interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who declared Kun the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice.  Together, they waged war on the Republic, stealing Jedi students from Ossus and subverting them to the dark side.  Qel-Droma defeated Lord Mandalore, earning the services of the [[Mandalorian]] warriors.  Qel-Droma attacked [[Coruscant]], but was captured.  Kun led a rescue attempt, and killed his former master in the process.  Soon thereafter, the Sith Lords caused the Cron Cluster to go [[supernova]], destroying countless Jedi artifacts on nearby Ossus.\n\nBefore Ossus was destroyed, Ulic's brother Cay tried to convince him to return to the light.  Ulic cut him down in a [[lightsaber]] duel and, horrified by what he had done, surrendered himself to his former lover, [[Nomi Sunrider]], when she forever cut off his connection to [[the Force]].  Broken, Ulic surrendered to the Republic, and led them to Yavin IV, where Exar Kun committed a ritual that sapped the life from every [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Massassi|Massassi]] on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it to his temple.\n\nThe ''Cleansing of the Nine Houses''  are the events during the aftermath of the Great Sith War, when, after the repentance of [[Ulic Qel-Droma]], and the death/ascencion of [[Exar Kun]], the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] hunted down and bloodily purged the remnants of the Sith Brotherhood.\n\nThe computer game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', takes place forty years after the end of the Sith War.\n\n==Comic series==\n{{plot too long|date=April 2020}}\n===''Knights of the Old Republic''===\n''Knights of the Old Republic'' (1993\u201394) is a five-part series by [[Tom Veitch]], Chris Gossett, Janine Johnston, and David Roach. It is set between 4,000 and 3,999 years before the Battle of Yavin.\n\n===''The Freedon Nadd Uprising''===\n''The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' (1994) is a two-part story arc by Tom Veitch, Tony Akins, and Dennis Rodier, set during the same era as the previous arc.\n\nWhile attempting to move the [[sarcophagi]] of Freedon Nadd and Queen Amanoa to the moon of Dxun, [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]]s Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, Tott Doneeta and Oss Wilum are attacked by several hundred Naddists, led by Warb Null, invading Iziz from underground. While distracting the Iziz forces, a group of Naddists are able to snatch the sarcophagi and take it back with them underground. Master Arca, Ulic and Queen Galia consult Galia's ailing father, King Ommin, for assistance. However, they are confronted by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, and Ommin betrays his seemingly immobile state by attacking Master Arca, knocking him unconscious. Warb Null comes in and attacks Ulic, but is soon bested and killed by the young Jedi. Unfortunately, this gives Ommin the time he needs to kidnap Master Arca.\n\nMeanwhile, on Ossus, Nomi Sunrider, Dace Diath, Shoaneb Culu, Kith Kark and Qrrrl Toq are chosen to defend Iziz in the forthcoming Second Battle of Onderon. On [[Coruscant]], heirs to the Empress Teta system royalty and members of the [[Dark side (Star Wars)|Dark Side]] [[cult]] the Krath, Satal and Aleema Keto, enter the Galactic Museum and find a fascinating [[Sith]] book. Satal steals it while the curator is not looking, and, after seeing a news report on the Sith practitioners still active in Iziz, the Ketos fly to Onderon to find said practitioners and discover the secrets of their new book.\n\nSatal and Aleema Keto arrive on Onderon to find a massive battle taking place. Their ship, ''The Krath Enchanter'', crashes, but the young Ketos are able to escape with their lives. Meanwhile, the Jedi task force from Ossus, led by Nomi Sunrider, battles their way through Sith war droids and Naddists. Kith Kark is killed in the assault, as the rest of the Jedi infiltrate the royal palace, meeting up with Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, Tott Doneeta and Oss Wilum. Meanwhile, the Ketos are greeted by King Ommin, hoping to unlock the mysteries of their stolen Sith tome. Ommin gives Satal an amulet, with which he can read the book perfectly, as Arca Jeth is hung on the wall, suffering under deadly Sith magic. Out in the battlefield, Cay Qel-Droma has his prosthetic arm cut off by a war droid, which he quickly dispatches of with his organic arm.\n\nThe group of seven Jedi arrive at King Ommin's stronghold, and Ulic slices off the former King's armature, sending him tumbling to the ground limply. Victorious, the forces of Iziz soon transport the sarcophagi of Freedon Nadd, Queen Amanoa and now King Ommin to Dxun, to forever be laid to rest.\n\n===''Dark Lords of the Sith''===\n''Dark Lords of the Sith'' (1994\u201395) is a six-part story arc by [[Kevin J.

They begin to plan a devastating attack on Coruscant.\n\n===Prequels===\n====''The Golden Age of the Sith''====\n''The Golden Age of the Sith'' (1996\u201397)  a six-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Chris Gossett, and Dario Carrasco Jr., set a millennium before the original comic.\n\nOdan-Urr is studying Jedi history when his master, Ooroo, sends him to the Koros system to help Empress Teta fight the Unification Wars and unite the seven worlds located in the system. Once he has arrived on Cinnagar he helps to conquer the last planet, Kirrek, with Battle Meditation, a technique he has learned about in his studies. But even with this technique he cannot prevent casualties from occurring; among them are two blockade runners, Hok and Timar Daragon. With their parents dead, Gav and Jori Daragon get their ship, ''Starbreaker 12'', back from Aarrba the Hutt who was holding it back as collateral.\n\nWith the ship Gav and Jori have become [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] explorers, but their latest route proves less than successful; they just barely make it through. They make it back to Cinnegar, but their ship is heavily damaged. Aarrba the Hutt agrees to make the repairs, but he won't give their ship back until they have paid all the bills.\n\nSsk Kahorr sends one of his drone ships along the route discovered by Gav and Jori, but it is destroyed when it passes too close to Primus Goluud, a red supergiant. Ssk Kahorr isn't pleased with this and sends two bounty hunters after the two hyperspace explorers. But they are saved by two Jedi, Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill. They advise them to leave the Koros system, because it is not safe for them. Gav and Jori steal back the ''Starbreaker 12'' and desperately flee the system with random hyperspace coordinates.\n\nOn [[Korriban]], on the far side of the galaxy, a funeral procession is held for Marka Ragnos, a [[Sith|Dark Lord of the Sith]]. The procession is led by Sith Lord Ludo Kressh. Just when the tomb is about to be closed, however, Kressh's nemesis, Naga Sadow, arrives. A fight about who should be the next Dark Lord ensues between the two rivals, but they are stopped by the ghost of Ragnos himself, who warns them of what is to come. Meanwhile, back in the Koros system, Odan-Urr has a premonition about the evil Jedi banished centuries ago. He tells Empress Teta about his dreams, and she promises that she will raise the matter on Coruscant.\nBack on Korriban, the ''Starbreaker 12'' arrives and Gav and Jori are captured by the Sith forces.\n\nOn Ziost, the Sith Lords discuss what to do with the prisoners. After a long debate it is decided to have Gav and Jori killed. But Naga Sadow, seeing in these prisoners a chance to expand the Sith Empire, does not give up this easily. He sends one of his Massassi warriors to retrieve the weapons on their ship. He hatches a plan to capture the prisoners for himself and use them to regain contact with the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]].\n\nTogether with his most loyal Massassi warriors, he frees the Daragons. But to keep his identity hidden from the other Sith Lords, he has to kill everyone in his path, including his old mentor Simus. He leaves a Republic blaster behind, to let others think it was an attack by the Republic. Gav and Jori are sent to his stronghold on Khar Shian and Sadow returns to Ziost where an urgent meeting is held between the Sith Lords. The other Sith Lords are indecisive about what to do and in the confusion he claims to be named the new Dark Lord of the Sith. The other Sith Lords, except Ludo Kressh and his supporters, agree. Sadow immediately calls upon the others to prepare their ships and warriors so they can attack the Republic first. Empress Teta and her two Jedi advisors have arrived at Coruscant, where she addresses the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] about Odan-Urr's premonition, but the people listening do not believe her. Even without the help of the Republic, Teta decides to prepare her own forces.\n\nIn Naga Sadow's hidden fortress on the dark side of Kar Shian, he trains Gav Daragon in the ways of the Sith. Sadow sends his Massassi warriors to retrieve the Starbreaker 12 from Ziost and then travels to his decoy fortress on Khar Delba, where Jori Daragon is held. On Ziost, Sadow's loyal Massassi steal the Starbreaker 12, but not without leaving evidence of their Master's involvement. Ludo Kressh discovers this evidence, and together with his supporters, Horak-mul and Dor Gal-ram, he prepares to attack Sadow's fortress on Khar Delba. Meanwhile, the ''Starbreaker 12'' arrives there.\n\nKressh's forces have arrived at Khar Delba and have opened fire at Sadow's apparently defenseless fortress. Sadow convinces Daragon that she must return to the Republic before the fortress is destroyed. Reluctant to leave her brother behind, she agrees. After the ''Starbreaker 12'' has escaped to hyperspace, Sadow calls in his fleet that he had hidden on the dark side of Khar Shian. But that is not all; Massassi warriors on the ships of Horak-mul and Dol Gal-ram kill the Sith Lords and direct their fire on Kressh, who has no choice but to retreat. After this victory, Sadow prepares his forces to invade the Republic, using the tracking beacon hidden on the ''Starbreaker 12''.\n\n====''The Fall of the Sith Empire''====\n''The Fall of the Sith Empire'' (1997) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Dario Carrasco, Dario Carrasco Jr, Bill Black, David Jacob Beckett, and Ray Murtaugh. Set in the same era as the previous comic, many battles are recounted.\n\nThe Battle of Coruscant was the first battle between the Galactic Republic and Naga Sadow's [[Sith Empire]].\nMemit Nadill, trusting in Odan-Urr's judgement, came to Coruscant to rally the [[Jedi]] before the Sith were to attack, but the invasion fleet came early. The Coruscant defense forces led by Jedi Guardian Anavus Svag defended the planet as other Republic forces and Jedi joined the defense.\nThe size of the Sith Lord's army is visually exaggerated and influenced by Sadow himself, meditating in his meditation sphere high above [[Primus Goluud]].\nWhen Gav Daragon fires on the sphere, Naga Sadow's concentration is disrupted, causing much of the army on Coruscant to fade. This increases the confidence and resolve of the Jedi and Republic soldiers, allowing them to take advantage and repel the Sith invasion.\n\nThe Battle of Koros Major is fought between the army of [[Koros]] and the [[Sith Empire]]. Naga Sadow's focus is on the [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Hyperspace War)|Battle of Coruscant]], so he appoints his prisoner Gav Daragon as commander of the Koros Major invasion fleet. As the battle begins, Gav lands on the planet to look for his sister Jori, with a group of [[Massassi]] bodyguards.\nAs Gav enters [[Aarrba the Hutt]]'s repair dock, his bodyguards see the [[Hutt (Star Wars)|Hutt]] as a threat, and attack and kill him. Jori enters at that exact moment and attacks Gav with a lightsaber given to her by Odan-Urr, assuming he had killed Aarrba. Gav escapes and flees the planet, leaving Teta's men to battle the Sith to eventual victory.\n\nThe Battle of Kirrek is fought between the army of Koros and the Sith Empire. Prior to the battle, Empress Teta had made an agreement with Commander Llaban, commander of the rebellion in the earlier Battle of Kirrek, to fight alongside each other to defend Kirrek against the Sith, earning [[amnesty]] for the ex-rebels. She also decides to let the prisoners mining the colony world of Ronika to fight in the defense of Kirrek, but they are absent for the beginning of the battle.\nEarly in the battle, Odan-Urr attempts to use his Battle Meditation as he did during the Unification Wars, but the fury and determination of the [[Massassi]] warriors is infallible. Led by the Sith Lord [[Shar Dakhan]], the Massassi break through the line of defenders and begin climbing the wall. Separating much of the defenders from the Sith onslaught, Odan-Urr's Master Ooroo orders the Kirrek rebels to find cover. He then tips himself over, shattering his cyanogen tank and sending the fumes into the breaths of several Massassi, killing them instantly. This kills Ooroo as well, as [[oxygen]] is just as toxic to him as cyanogen is to the Massassi.\nAs the prisoners from Ronika arrive, and with the death of the Sith commander, victory for the Tetans quickly becomes a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe Battle of Primus Goluud takes place above the red supergiant Primus Goluud between Empress Teta's forces and the Sith Empire. Jori Daragon leads Empress Teta to her brother Gav, presuming he has turned to the dark side of [[the Force]]. Gav, trapped in Sadow's [[meditation]] sphere, proves he is still on their side by transmitting the coordinates to Korriban to Teta's ship.\nSoon, the dark lord's ships arrives and engages the Koros battalion. Sadow wastes no time in using a [[superweapon]] attached to his flagship to trigger [[solar flare]]s across Primus Goluud. The Sith forces retreat to the Sith Empire, closely followed by Teta's ships, as Gav is left to die in the meditation sphere.\n\nThe First Battle of Korriban is fought between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh's respective war fleets high above the Sith funeral world of Korriban.\nFleeing the [[Battle of Primus Goluud]], Sadow's fleet is confronted by Kressh, who declares himself the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] and banishes Sadow from the [[Sith Empire]]. A fierce battle between the Sith Lords ensues, until Sadow crashes one of his ships into Kressh's flagship, killing the new Dark Lord.\n\nThe Second Battle of Korriban immediately follows the first battle. The Tetan forces, using coordinates given to them by Gav Daragon, come out of [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] very soon after Kressh's death in the First Battle of Korriban, catching Sadow by surprise. This allows the Koros ships to quickly put the Sith Empire's forces at a disadvantage.\nSadow has another trick up his sleeve, however; the Dark Lord orders his Massassi to kill their commanders on each ship, leaving a massive, impassable barricade between himself and the Koros fleet. Sadow then flees to [[Yavin 4]] with his one remaining ship, to hopefully rebuild the once glorious Sith legacy.\n\n===Sequel===\n''Redemption'' (1998) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson and Chris Gossett. It is set ten years after the end of the original comic run.\n\nHoggon's ship arrives in the Yavin System and makes its way to the surface. Hoggon tells Ulic of the events that happened there, but all Ulic can see is ghosts, including that of his dead brother, Cay. Ulic tells Hoggon that this place will not do as well.\n\nOn [[Ryloth]], many [[Twi'lek]]s flee as a heat storm rages upon them, with Jedi Tott Doneeta doing what he can to help. He tries using the force to hold back the storm, but is overwhelmed, receiving burns across the side of his face. Rather than stay and rest his wounds, he announces that he must leave for the Great Jedi Convocation.\n\nOn Exis Station, Master Thon arrives, meeting Vima Sunrider, now a teenager. The two are shortly interrupted by the Cathar Jedi Sylvar, and the two Jedi leave Vima to join the convocation that has begun. While Nomi speaks, Vima gets bored and decides to take off and try out flying a mining ship. But, while flying, Vima gets caught in a magnetic loop and has her ship disabled and is forced to eject. She is then rescued by a late arrival for the convocation, Tott Doneeta. Upon arriving back at the station, Nomi questions her daughter's actions, asking how she can expect to become a Jedi with such brash choices. Vima responds by saying if Nomi would spend more time training her, she could have gotten out of it herself.\n\nElsewhere, Hoggon's ship arrives on the icy surface of Rhen Var. Upon landing, Ulic announces that he is satisfied with this place. Hoggon arrives at Exis Station and takes a place in an airshaft to watch the convocation, as Sylvar has taken the chance to speak. She talks of Ulic Qel-Droma and mentions that he betrayed the Jedi and now wanders free. She makes reference to Ulic's conspiring with Exar Kun, and the death of Jedi, including her mate Crado. She then states that Ulic is the greatest shame of the Jedi Knights.\n\nOn Rhen Var, Ulic takes up his lightsaber, but cannot feel anything in the force. The weapon is nothing but a tool in his hands. The ground beneath him then gives way, dropping him into a hole.\n\nBack on Exis, Vima stares at two hologram's belonging to her mother; one is Vima's father, Andur, and the other is Ulic. Vima asks her mother about training, to which Nomi responds with \"not today.\" Vima then goes off to the docking bay, stowing away on a ship, intent on finding her own trainer. Also in the docking bay is Tott, who asks Sylvar to come with him to Ryloth, in order to deal with the anger within her.\n\nUpon arriving at the new city of Tott's clan, the two Jedi are told of an attack on the clan by another clan. Tott leaves to deal with the situation and asks Sylvar to help while he is gone. Sylvar decides to try and rally the clan, telling them that they must attack and have revenge. Tott returns to announce that blood shed does not create peaces, and that a solution has been reached; the two clan leaders will go into the desert together and a new head-clan will join the tribes. Not used to the difference in custom, Sylvar asks to be taken home to Cathar.\n\nOn Rhen Var, Ulic looks back on what he has done in the past; betraying Nomi and killing Cay. He considers this to be a place as good as any to die, but is urged to live on by an image of his deceased teacher, Master Arca Jeth. Ulic pulls his strength together and climbs back up through the snow.\n\nOn Exis Station, Nomi finds her hologram of Ulic missing, and is told by Master Thon that Vima is missing.\n\nOn his ship, Hoggon discovers that Vima has stowed away on his ship. Vima says she is looking for Ulic Qel-Droma, and show Hoggon the hologram. Hoggon takes her to Rhen Var and drops her on the planet, giving her a transmitter with which to contact him. After Hoggon leaves, Vima states that she will not leave until she is a Jedi.\n\n==Collected editions==\n\n*''Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic'' (1994) {{ISBN|1-56971-020-1}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' (1995) {{ISBN|1-56971-307-3}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56971-095-3}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56971-173-9}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Golden Age of the Sith'' (1997) {{ISBN|1-56971-229-8}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-320-0}}\n*''Tales of the Jedi: Redemption'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-56971-535-1}}\n*''Star Wars Omnibus: Tales of the Jedi Volume 1'' (2007) {{ISBN|1-59307-830-7}}\n*''Star Wars Omnibus: Tales of the Jedi Volume 2'' (2008) {{ISBN|1-59307-911-7}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wookieepedia|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi}}\n* [http://www.rebelscum.com/darkhorse_totj.asp Tales of the Jedi graphic novel info]\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Star Wars comics}}\n\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:1993 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1997 audio plays]]\n[[Category:Dark Horse Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Comics based on Star Wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Tales of the Jedi''}}\n[[File:Totj kotor1.jpg|thumb|[[Dave Dorman]]'s cover art for the first issue of ''Tales of the Jedi''.

They are part of the fictional [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], and cover the [[Great Sith War]] and the [[Great Hyperspace War]]. The series represented the earliest chronological ''Star Wars'' stories until the publication of the ''[[Dawn of the Jedi]]'' series of comics and novels.\n\nThe first books released covered the Great Sith War (4,000 BBY, or Before the [[Battle of Yavin]]). The latter were prequels that covered the Great Hyperspace War, which happened a thousand years earlier.\n\n==Summary==\nThe [[Great Hyperspace War]] was instigated when two [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] hyperspace explorers accidentally crash-landed on the [[Sith]] graveyard planet [[Korriban]] during the funeral procession of Marka Ragnos.  His successor, [[List of minor Sith characters#Sadow, Naga|Naga Sadow]], provoked war with the Republic, and installed himself as the leader of the [[Sith Empire]].  He fought not only the Republic, but the forces of his chief rival, Ludo Kressh, and was forced to destroy his own fleet to cover his escape.  Sadow landed on [[Yavin IV]] and constructed vast temples with the labor of his [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Massassi|Massassi]] warriors.\n\nSix hundred years later, fallen [[Jedi]] Freedon Nadd arrived on Yavin IV, and learned Sith sorcery from the spirit of Naga Sadow.  He took his knowledge and the treasures of Sadow to the planet [[Onderon]], where he used his acquired gifts to install himself as [[monarch|king]].  His spirit continued to advise his descendants.\n\nAnother Jedi, [[Ulic Qel-Droma]], was sent to Onderon to mediate a conflict, where he met the spirit of Freedon Nadd, who told him he would become a Sith Lord.  The prophecy came true when the Krath, a secret dark side society, attacked the Republic and injured Ulic with alchemically-treated shrapnel, and then injected him with dark side poisons that would ensure his fall.\n\n[[Exar Kun]] left his master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, because his master would not let him learn about the dark side.  He went to Onderon, where he learned of Freedon Nadd's tomb.  Nadd's spirit told him to go to Korriban, where Nadd tricked him into accepting the dark side.  They went to Yavin IV, where Nadd gave him a choice: surrender to the dark side, or die.  Kun chose life.  After learning about the dark side from Nadd, Kun destroyed him with a dark side amulet.\n\nExar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma met on Cinnagar, and their battle was interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who declared Kun the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice.  Together, they waged war on the Republic, stealing Jedi students from Ossus and subverting them to the dark side.  Qel-Droma defeated Lord Mandalore, earning the services of the [[Mandalorian]] warriors.  Qel-Droma attacked [[Coruscant]], but was captured.  Kun led a rescue attempt, and killed his former master in the process.  Soon thereafter, the Sith Lords caused the Cron Cluster to go [[supernova]], destroying countless Jedi artifacts on nearby Ossus.\n\nBefore Ossus was destroyed, Ulic's brother Cay tried to convince him to return to the light.  Ulic cut him down in a [[lightsaber]] duel and, horrified by what he had done, surrendered himself to his former lover, [[Nomi Sunrider]], when she forever cut off his connection to [[the Force]].  Broken, Ulic surrendered to the Republic, and led them to Yavin IV, where Exar Kun committed a ritual that sapped the life from every [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Massassi|Massassi]] on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it to his temple.\n\nThe ''Cleansing of the Nine Houses''  are the events during the aftermath of the Great Sith War, when, after the repentance of [[Ulic Qel-Droma]], and the death/ascencion of [[Exar Kun]], the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] hunted down and bloodily purged the remnants of the Sith Brotherhood.\n\nThe computer game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', takes place forty years after the end of the Sith War.\n\n==Comic series==\n{{plot too long|date=April 2020}}\n===''Knights of the Old Republic''===\n''Knights of the Old Republic'' (1993\u201394) is a five-part series by [[Tom Veitch]], Chris Gossett, Janine Johnston, and David Roach.

Master Arca, Ulic and Queen Galia consult Galia's ailing father, King Ommin, for assistance. However, they are confronted by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, and Ommin betrays his seemingly immobile state by attacking Master Arca, knocking him unconscious.

Gav and Jori are sent to his stronghold on Khar Shian and Sadow returns to Ziost where an urgent meeting is held between the Sith Lords. The other Sith Lords are indecisive about what to do and in the confusion he claims to be named the new Dark Lord of the Sith. The other Sith Lords, except Ludo Kressh and his supporters, agree. Sadow immediately calls upon the others to prepare their ships and warriors so they can attack the Republic first. Empress Teta and her two Jedi advisors have arrived at Coruscant, where she addresses the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] about Odan-Urr's premonition, but the people listening do not believe her. Even without the help of the Republic, Teta decides to prepare her own forces.\n\nIn Naga Sadow's hidden fortress on the dark side of Kar Shian, he trains Gav Daragon in the ways of the Sith. Sadow sends his Massassi warriors to retrieve the Starbreaker 12 from Ziost and then travels to his decoy fortress on Khar Delba, where Jori Daragon is held. On Ziost, Sadow's loyal Massassi steal the Starbreaker 12, but not without leaving evidence of their Master's involvement. Ludo Kressh discovers this evidence, and together with his supporters, Horak-mul and Dor Gal-ram, he prepares to attack Sadow's fortress on Khar Delba. Meanwhile, the ''Starbreaker 12'' arrives there.\n\nKressh's forces have arrived at Khar Delba and have opened fire at Sadow's apparently defenseless fortress. Sadow convinces Daragon that she must return to the Republic before the fortress is destroyed. Reluctant to leave her brother behind, she agrees. After the ''Starbreaker 12'' has escaped to hyperspace, Sadow calls in his fleet that he had hidden on the dark side of Khar Shian. But that is not all; Massassi warriors on the ships of Horak-mul and Dol Gal-ram kill the Sith Lords and direct their fire on Kressh, who has no choice but to retreat. After this victory, Sadow prepares his forces to invade the Republic, using the tracking beacon hidden on the ''Starbreaker 12''.\n\n====''The Fall of the Sith Empire''====\n''The Fall of the Sith Empire'' (1997) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Dario Carrasco, Dario Carrasco Jr, Bill Black, David Jacob Beckett, and Ray Murtaugh. Set in the same era as the previous comic, many battles are recounted.\n\nThe Battle of Coruscant was the first battle between the Galactic Republic and Naga Sadow's [[Sith Empire]].\nMemit Nadill, trusting in Odan-Urr's judgement, came to Coruscant to rally the [[Jedi]] before the Sith were to attack, but the invasion fleet came early. The Coruscant defense forces led by Jedi Guardian Anavus Svag defended the planet as other Republic forces and Jedi joined the defense.\nThe size of the Sith Lord's army is visually exaggerated and influenced by Sadow himself, meditating in his meditation sphere high above [[Primus Goluud]].\nWhen Gav Daragon fires on the sphere, Naga Sadow's concentration is disrupted, causing much of the army on Coruscant to fade. This increases the confidence and resolve of the Jedi and Republic soldiers, allowing them to take advantage and repel the Sith invasion.\n\nThe Battle of Koros Major is fought between the army of [[Koros]] and the [[Sith Empire]]. Naga Sadow's focus is on the [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Hyperspace War)|Battle of Coruscant]], so he appoints his prisoner Gav Daragon as commander of the Koros Major invasion fleet. As the battle begins, Gav lands on the planet to look for his sister Jori, with a group of [[Massassi]] bodyguards.\nAs Gav enters [[Aarrba the Hutt]]'s repair dock, his bodyguards see the [[Hutt (Star Wars)|Hutt]] as a threat, and attack and kill him. Jori enters at that exact moment and attacks Gav with a lightsaber given to her by Odan-Urr, assuming he had killed Aarrba. Gav escapes and flees the planet, leaving Teta's men to battle the Sith to eventual victory.\n\nThe Battle of Kirrek is fought between the army of Koros and the Sith Empire. Prior to the battle, Empress Teta had made an agreement with Commander Llaban, commander of the rebellion in the earlier Battle of Kirrek, to fight alongside each other to defend Kirrek against the Sith, earning [[amnesty]] for the ex-rebels. She also decides to let the prisoners mining the colony world of Ronika to fight in the defense of Kirrek, but they are absent for the beginning of the battle.\nEarly in the battle, Odan-Urr attempts to use his Battle Meditation as he did during the Unification Wars, but the fury and determination of the [[Massassi]] warriors is infallible. Led by the Sith Lord [[Shar Dakhan]], the Massassi break through the line of defenders and begin climbing the wall. Separating much of the defenders from the Sith onslaught, Odan-Urr's Master Ooroo orders the Kirrek rebels to find cover. He then tips himself over, shattering his cyanogen tank and sending the fumes into the breaths of several Massassi, killing them instantly. This kills Ooroo as well, as [[oxygen]] is just as toxic to him as cyanogen is to the Massassi.\nAs the prisoners from Ronika arrive, and with the death of the Sith commander, victory for the Tetans quickly becomes a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe Battle of Primus Goluud takes place above the red supergiant Primus Goluud between Empress Teta's forces and the Sith Empire. Jori Daragon leads Empress Teta to her brother Gav, presuming he has turned to the dark side of [[the Force]]. Gav, trapped in Sadow's [[meditation]] sphere, proves he is still on their side by transmitting the coordinates to Korriban to Teta's ship.\nSoon, the dark lord's ships arrives and engages the Koros battalion. Sadow wastes no time in using a [[superweapon]] attached to his flagship to trigger [[solar flare]]s across Primus Goluud. The Sith forces retreat to the Sith Empire, closely followed by Teta's ships, as Gav is left to die in the meditation sphere.\n\nThe First Battle of Korriban is fought between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh's respective war fleets high above the Sith funeral world of Korriban.\nFleeing the [[Battle of Primus Goluud]], Sadow's fleet is confronted by Kressh, who declares himself the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] and banishes Sadow from the [[Sith Empire]]. A fierce battle between the Sith Lords ensues, until Sadow crashes one of his ships into Kressh's flagship, killing the new Dark Lord.\n\nThe Second Battle of Korriban immediately follows the first battle. The Tetan forces, using coordinates given to them by Gav Daragon, come out of [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] very soon after Kressh's death in the First Battle of Korriban, catching Sadow by surprise. This allows the Koros ships to quickly put the Sith Empire's forces at a disadvantage.\nSadow has another trick up his sleeve, however; the Dark Lord orders his Massassi to kill their commanders on each ship, leaving a massive, impassable barricade between himself and the Koros fleet. Sadow then flees to [[Yavin 4]] with his one remaining ship, to hopefully rebuild the once glorious Sith legacy.\n\n===Sequel===\n''Redemption'' (1998) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson and Chris Gossett. It is set ten years after the end of the original comic run.\n\nHoggon's ship arrives in the Yavin System and makes its way to the surface. Hoggon tells Ulic of the events that happened there, but all Ulic can see is ghosts, including that of his dead brother, Cay. Ulic tells Hoggon that this place will not do as well.\n\nOn [[Ryloth]], many [[Twi'lek]]s flee as a heat storm rages upon them, with Jedi Tott Doneeta doing what he can to help. He tries using the force to hold back the storm, but is overwhelmed, receiving burns across the side of his face. Rather than stay and rest his wounds, he announces that he must leave for the Great Jedi Convocation.\n\nOn Exis Station, Master Thon arrives, meeting Vima Sunrider, now a teenager. The two are shortly interrupted by the Cathar Jedi Sylvar, and the two Jedi leave Vima to join the convocation that has begun. While Nomi speaks, Vima gets bored and decides to take off and try out flying a mining ship. But, while flying, Vima gets caught in a magnetic loop and has her ship disabled and is forced to eject. She is then rescued by a late arrival for the convocation, Tott Doneeta. Upon arriving back at the station, Nomi questions her daughter's actions, asking how she can expect to become a Jedi with such brash choices. Vima responds by saying if Nomi would spend more time training her, she could have gotten out of it herself.\n\nElsewhere, Hoggon's ship arrives on the icy surface of Rhen Var. Upon landing, Ulic announces that he is satisfied with this place. Hoggon arrives at Exis Station and takes a place in an airshaft to watch the convocation, as Sylvar has taken the chance to speak. She talks of Ulic Qel-Droma and mentions that he betrayed the Jedi and now wanders free. She makes reference to Ulic's conspiring with Exar Kun, and the death of Jedi, including her mate Crado. She then states that Ulic is the greatest shame of the Jedi Knights.\n\nOn Rhen Var, Ulic takes up his lightsaber, but cannot feel anything in the force. The weapon is nothing but a tool in his hands. The ground beneath him then gives way, dropping him into a hole.\n\nBack on Exis, Vima stares at two hologram's belonging to her mother; one is Vima's father, Andur, and the other is Ulic. Vima asks her mother about training, to which Nomi responds with \"not today.\" Vima then goes off to the docking bay, stowing away on a ship, intent on finding her own trainer. Also in the docking bay is Tott, who asks Sylvar to come with him to Ryloth, in order to deal with the anger within her.\n\nUpon arriving at the new city of Tott's clan, the two Jedi are told of an attack on the clan by another clan. Tott leaves to deal with the situation and asks Sylvar to help while he is gone. Sylvar decides to try and rally the clan, telling them that they must attack and have revenge. Tott returns to announce that blood shed does not create peaces, and that a solution has been reached; the two clan leaders will go into the desert together and a new head-clan will join the tribes. Not used to the difference in custom, Sylvar asks to be taken home to Cathar.\n\nOn Rhen Var, Ulic looks back on what he has done in the past; betraying Nomi and killing Cay. He considers this to be a place as good as any to die, but is urged to live on by an image of his deceased teacher, Master Arca Jeth. Ulic pulls his strength together and climbs back up through the snow.\n\nOn Exis Station, Nomi finds her hologram of Ulic missing, and is told by Master Thon that Vima is missing.\n\nOn his ship, Hoggon discovers that Vima has stowed away on his ship. Vima says she is looking for Ulic Qel-Droma, and show Hoggon the hologram. Hoggon takes her to Rhen Var and drops her on the planet, giving her a transmitter with which to contact him. After Hoggon leaves, Vima states that she will not leave until she is a Jedi.\n\n==Collected editions==\n\n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Golden Age of the Sith'' (1997) {{ISBN|1-56971-229-8}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-320-0}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic'' (1994) {{ISBN|1-56971-020-1}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' (1995) {{ISBN|1-56971-307-3}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56971-095-3}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56971-173-9}} \n*''Tales of the Jedi: Redemption'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-56971-535-1}}\n*''Star Wars Omnibus: Tales of the Jedi Volume 1'' (2007) {{ISBN|1-59307-830-7}}\n*''Star Wars Omnibus: Tales of the Jedi Volume 2'' (2008) {{ISBN|1-59307-911-7}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wookieepedia|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi}}\n* [http://www.rebelscum.com/darkhorse_totj.asp Tales of the Jedi graphic novel info]\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Star Wars comics}}\n\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:1993 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1997 audio plays]]\n[[Category:Dark Horse Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Comics based on Star Wars]]\n", "name_user": "UpdateNerd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCollected editions:chronological", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Jedi"}
