Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

called the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], a form of noninvasive negative-pressure ventilator widely used during the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] epidemics of the twentieth century after the introduction of the \"Drinker respirator\" in 1928, improvements introduced by [[John Haven Emerson]] in 1931,<ref name=\"pmid18189086\">{{cite journal |last=Geddes |first=LA |year=2007 |title=The history of artificial respiration |journal=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine |pmid=18189086 |doi=10.1109/EMB.2007.907081 |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=38\u201341}}</ref> and the [[Both respirator]] in 1937. Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\". It was a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] device and therefore required no [[electrical power]] source to operate.\n\nIn 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]) and [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions.<ref>{{cite book |date=1965 |title=Army R, D & A. |publisher=Development and Engineering Directorate, HQ, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sTrO77DCgkwC&pg=RA6-PA33&lpg=RA6-PA33&dq=Army+Emergency+Respirator,+HDL#v=onepage&q=Army%20Emergency%20Respirator,%20HDL&f=false}}</ref> Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Mon |first1=George |last2=Woodward |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Straub |first3=Henrik |last4=Joyce |first4=James |last5=Meyer |first5=James |date=1966 |title=Fluid Amplifier-Controlled Medical Devices |journal=SAE Transactions |issn=0096-736X |jstor=44554326 |volume=74 |pages=217\u2013222}}</ref> The mask is composed of a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (commercially known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Lucite]]) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Army Research and Development Monthly Magazine |volume=6 |number=9 |url=https://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/archives/1965/Sep_1965.PDF}}</ref> The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller.

It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation.\n\nVentilators used under increased pressure (hyperbaric) require special precautions, and few ventilators can operate under these conditions.<ref name=SPUMS1998>{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=M |year=1998 |title=Ventilator function under hyperbaric conditions |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5927 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> In 1979, Sechrist Industries introduced their Model 500A ventilator, which was specifically designed for use with [[hyperbaric chamber]]s.<ref name=JHM1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver LK, Greenway L, Elliot CG |year=1988 |title=Performance of the Seachrist 500A Hyperbaric Ventilator in a Monoplace Hyperbaric Chamber |journal=Journal of Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=215\u2013225 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4377 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Microprocessor ventilators===\n[[Microprocessor control]] led to the third generation of [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) ventilators, starting with the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] EV-A<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00e4ger - die Geschichte des Unternehmens |language= |publisher=Dr\u00e4ger |website=Dr\u00e4ger |url=https://www.draeger.com/Corporate/Content/draeger_die_geschichte_des_unternehmens.pdf |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref> in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patient's [[Breathing#Respiratory_disorders|breathing curve]] on an [[LCD monitor]].

Deaths caused by [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] have occurred when the most severely infected experience [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], a widespread inflammation in the lungs that impairs the lungs' ability to absorb oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. These patients require a capable ventilator to continue breathing.\n\nAmong ventilators that might be brought into the fight, there have been many concerns.

Bush]]), the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] ([[BARDA]]) of the [[United States]] realized that the country was likely to have an epidemic of respiratory disease and would need more ventilators, so it awarded a $6 million contract to [[Newport Medical Instruments]], a small company in California, to make 40,000 ventilators for under $3,000 apiece. In 2011, Newport sent three prototypes to the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. In 2012, [[Covidien]], a $12 billion/year medical device manufacturer, which manufactured more expensive competing ventilators, bought Newport for $100 million. Covidien delayed and in 2014 cancelled the contract.\n\nBARDA started over again with a new company, [[Philips]], and in July 2019, the [[FDA]] approved the Philips ventilator, and the government ordered 10,000 ventilators for delivery in mid-2020.<ref name=\"Aura\">{{cite news\n| author = Nicholas Kulish, Sarah Kliff and Jessica Silver-Greenberg\n| title = The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

section|date=April 2020}}\nThe history of mechanical ventilation begins with various versions of what was eventually called the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], a form of noninvasive negative-pressure ventilator widely used during the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] epidemics of the twentieth century after the introduction of the \"Drinker respirator\" in 1928, improvements introduced by [[John Haven Emerson]] in 1931,<ref name=\"pmid18189086\">{{cite journal |last=Geddes |first=LA |year=2007 |title=The history of artificial respiration |journal=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\".

It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery.

Thus a \"double Pacific\" type Garratt is a {{whyte|4-6-2+2-6-4}}. For Garratt locomotives the + sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels, e.g. the [[LMS Garratt]] {{whyte|2-6-0+0-6-2}}.  This is because the two engine units are more than just [[power bogie]]s. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The + sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.\n\nSimpler articulated types such as [[Mallet (locomotive)|Mallet]]s have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels. Typically, the forward frame is free to swing, whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler. Thus a [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] is a {{whyte|4-8-8-4}}; four leading wheels, one group of eight driving wheels, another group of eight driving wheels, and then four trailing wheels.\n\n=== Duplex locomotives ===\nThis numbering system is shared by [[Duplex locomotive|duplex locomotives]], which have powered wheel sets sharing a rigid frame.\n\n=== Suffixes ===\nA number of standard suffixes can be used to extend the Whyte notation:<ref name=irs>{{irs-el|el=17}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Suffix\n!Meaning\n!Example\n|-\n|colspan=2|[No Suffix]\n|[[Tender locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|T\n|[[Tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-2|Tank}}\n|-\n|\n|T\n|[[Side tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-2|T}}\n|-\n|\n|ST\n|[[Saddle tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|ST}}\n|-\n|\n|WT\n|[[Well tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|WT}}\n|-\n|\n|PT\n|[[Pannier tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|PT}}\n|-\n|\n|C or CT\n|[[Crane tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-2|CT}}\n|-\n|\n|IST\n|[[Inverted saddle tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-2|IST}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|T+T (or ST+T, WT+T, etc.)\n|[[Tank locomotive]] which also has a [[Tender (rail)|tender]]\n|{{whyte|4-6-2|T|T}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|VB or VBT\n|[[Vertical boilered locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|VB}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|F\n|[[Fireless locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|2-6-0|F}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|R\n|[[Railcar]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-4-0|R}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|R or RT\n|[[Rack locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|RT}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|G\n|[[Geared locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|G}}\n|}\n\n=== Internal combustion locomotives ===\nThe wheel arrangement of small [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline|petrol]] locomotives can be classified using the same notation as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. Where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w, 6w or 8w are generally used. Suffixes specific to internal combustion locomotives include:<ref name=irs/>\n\n*PM [[Locomotive#Petrol|petrol mechanical]]\n*PE [[Petrol-electric locomotive|petrol electric]]\n*D [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]]\n*DM [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013mechanical|diesel mechanical]]\n*DE [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013electric|diesel electric]]\n*DH [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013hydraulic|diesel hydraulic]]\n*BE [[Locomotive#Battery-electric|battery electric]]\n*OE [[Electric locomotive#Overhead lines|overhead electric lines]]\n*CA [[Fireless locomotive#Compressed air|compressed air]]\n\nThus {{whyte|4w|PM}} indicates a four-wheel petrol locomotive with mechanical transmission and {{whyte|0-6-0|DE}} indicates a six-wheeled diesel locomotive with side rods and an electric transmission. For large diesel locomotives the [[UIC classification]] is used.\n\n== Naming ==\nIn American (and to a lesser extent British) practice, most wheel arrangements in common use were given names, sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built. For example, the [[2-2-0]] type arrangement is named ''Planet'', after [[Planet (locomotive)|the 1830 locomotive]] on which it was first used.

The notation counts the number of [[leading wheel]]s, then the number of [[driving wheel]]s, and finally the number of [[trailing wheel]]s, numbers being separated by dashes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=201| title=Builder's plates: A locomotive's birth certificate| publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]]| author=Thompson, Keith| date=2006-05-01| accessdate=2008-02-08| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122011919/http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=201| archivedate=22 November 2008| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other classification schemes, like [[UIC classification]] and the French, Turkish and [[Swiss locomotive and railcar classification|Swiss]] systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels.\n\nIn the notation a locomotive with two leading axles (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) and then one trailing axle (two wheels) is classified as [[4-6-2]], and is commonly known as a ''Pacific''.\n\n== Method ==\n\n=== Articulated locomotives ===\n[[Articulated locomotive]]s such as [[Garratt]]s, which are effectively two locomotives joined by a common [[boiler]], have a + between the arrangements of the engines. Thus a \"double Pacific\" type Garratt is a {{whyte|4-6-2+2-6-4}}. For Garratt locomotives the + sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels, e.g. the [[LMS Garratt]] {{whyte|2-6-0+0-6-2}}.  This is because the two engine units are more than just [[power bogie]]s. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The + sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.\n\nSimpler articulated types such as [[Mallet (locomotive)|Mallet]]s have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels. Typically, the forward frame is free to swing, whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler. Thus a [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] is a {{whyte|4-8-8-4}}; four leading wheels, one group of eight driving wheels, another group of eight driving wheels, and then four trailing wheels.\n\n=== Duplex locomotives ===\nThis numbering system is shared by [[Duplex locomotive|duplex locomotives]], which have powered wheel sets sharing a rigid frame.\n\n=== Suffixes ===\nA number of standard suffixes can be used to extend the Whyte notation:<ref name=irs>{{irs-el|el=17}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Suffix\n!Meaning\n!Example\n|-\n|colspan=2|[No Suffix]\n|[[Tender locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|T\n|[[Tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-2|Tank}}\n|-\n|\n|T\n|[[Side tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-2|T}}\n|-\n|\n|ST\n|[[Saddle tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|ST}}\n|-\n|\n|WT\n|[[Well tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|WT}}\n|-\n|\n|PT\n|[[Pannier tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|PT}}\n|-\n|\n|C or CT\n|[[Crane tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-2|CT}}\n|-\n|\n|IST\n|[[Inverted saddle tank locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-2|IST}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|T+T (or ST+T, WT+T, etc.)\n|[[Tank locomotive]] which also has a [[tender]]\n|{{whyte|4-6-2|T|T}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|VB or VBT\n|[[Vertical boilered locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|VB}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|F\n|[[Fireless locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|2-6-0|F}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|R\n|[[Railcar]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-4-0|R}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|R or RT\n|[[Rack locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-4-0|RT}}\n|-\n|colspan=2|G\n|[[Geared locomotive]]\n|{{whyte|0-6-0|G}}\n|}\n\n=== Internal combustion locomotives ===\nThe wheel arrangement of small [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline|petrol]] locomotives can be classified using the same notation as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. Where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w, 6w or 8w are generally used. Suffixes specific to internal combustion locomotives include:<ref name=irs/>\n\n*PM [[Locomotive#Petrol|petrol mechanical]]\n*PE [[Petrol-electric locomotive|petrol electric]]\n*D [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]]\n*DM [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013mechanical|diesel mechanical]]\n*DE [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013electric|diesel electric]]\n*DH [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel\u2013hydraulic|diesel hydraulic]]\n*BE [[Locomotive#Battery-electric|battery electric]]\n*OE [[Electric locomotive#Overhead lines|overhead electric lines]]\n*CA [[Fireless locomotive#Compressed air|compressed air]]\n\nThus {{whyte|4w|PM}} indicates a four-wheel petrol locomotive with mechanical transmission and {{whyte|0-6-0|DE}} indicates a six-wheeled diesel locomotive with side rods and an electric transmission. For large diesel locomotives the [[UIC classification]] is used.\n\n== Naming ==\nIn American (and to a lesser extent British) practice, most wheel arrangements in common use were given names, sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built. For example, the [[2-2-0]] type arrangement is named ''Planet'', after [[Planet (locomotive)|the 1830 locomotive]] on which it was first used. (This naming convention is similar to the naming of warship classes.)\n\n=== Common wheel arrangements ===\nThe most common wheel arrangements are listed below.

Findings from animal models, human case reports, and a few epidemiological studies suggest that Cryptosporidium may be transmitted via respiratory secretions, in addition to the more recognized fecal-oral route.&nbsp;... Upper respiratory cryptosporidiosis may cause inflammation of the nasal mucosa, sinuses, larynx, and trachea, accompanied by nasal discharge and voice change (54, 61, 62). Cryptosporidiosis of the lower respiratory tract typically results in productive cough, dyspnea, fever, and hypoxemia (63,\u201366).&nbsp;... While fecal-oral transmission is indisputably the major route of infection, transmission via coughing and fomites is also possible in situations of close contact (20).&nbsp;... Because they lacked gastrointestinal symptoms and oocyst excretion, the latter cases establish the possibility of primary respiratory infection with Cryptosporidium, which may have been acquired by inhalation of expectorated droplets or by contact with fomites.&nbsp;...

As a result, infected individuals may experience severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and potentially death. In general, the mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is based on [[CD4+]] marker counts. Patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm\u00b3 recover with supportive hospital care and medication; but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm\u00b3, the effects are usually fatal within 3 to 6&nbsp;months. During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm\u00b3 and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm\u00b3 died within the first year of contracting the infection.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ian |last=Gilson M.D. |author2=Buggy, Brian P.

Developmental stages of the life cycle of the parasite might act as possible targets for vaccine development. The organism is detected in 65\u201397% of the [[surface-water]] supply in the United States and is resistant to most disinfectants used for the treatment of drinking water. [[Antibodies]] in the serum of humans and animals infected with ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' react with several antigens, one of which is a 15&nbsp;{{abbrlink|kDa|kilodalton}} protein ([[CP15]]) located on the surface of the organism. This protein is a good candidate for use as a molecular vaccine because previous studies have shown that a [[monoclonal antibody]] to CP15 confers [[passive immunity]] to mice.  Currently, there is no vaccine or completely effective drug therapy against ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' in HIV/AIDS individuals.<ref name=\"MS Crypto treatment\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane immunocompromised\" />\n\nA summary of discoveries presented at the most recent (June 2019) international symposium on ''Cryptosporidium'' has been published in 2020.<ref name=\"WidmerCarmena2020\">{{cite journal|last1=Widmer|first1=Giovanni|last2=Carmena|first2=David|last3=Kv\u00e1\u010d|first3=Martin|last4=Chalmers|first4=Rachel M.|last5=Kissinger|first5=Jessica C.|last6=Xiao|first6=Lihua|last7=Sateriale|first7=Adam|last8=Striepen|first8=Boris|last9=Laurent|first9=Fabrice|last10=Lacroix-Lamand\u00e9|first10=Sonia|last11=Gargala|first11=Gilles|last12=Favennec|first12=Lo\u00efc|title=Update on ''Cryptosporidium'' spp.: highlights from the Seventh International Giardia and Cryptosporidium Conference|journal=Parasite|volume=27|year=2020|pages=14|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2020011|url=https://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2020/01/parasite200029/parasite200029.html|doi-access=free}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nThe most important [[zoonotic]] reservoirs are [[cattle]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lassen B, St\u00e5hl M, Enemark HL |title=Cryptosporidiosis - an occupational risk and a disregarded disease in Estonia. |journal=Acta Vet.

{"title_page": "Judith Lang Zaimont", "text_new": "'''Judith Lang Zaimont''' ({{IPA|[\u02c8ze\u026am\u0252nt]}};<ref>{{cite web |title=Progressive Difference Interview with Judith Lang Zaimont |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=956fQk8Z7Fw |website=YouTube |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> born November 8, 1945) is an American composer and pianist.<ref>\"Zaimont,\" in ''International Encyclopedia of Women Composers'', 773.</ref>\n\n== Background information ==\nJudith Lang Zaimont was born on November 8, 1945 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Both Zaimont and her sister, Doris Lang Kosloff, began piano lessons with their mother, Bertha Lang, who was an accomplished pianist and singer.  Bertha was very active in the music profession and served as a president of the New York State Music Teachers Association. Judith began lessons at [[Juilliard]] at age 12, where she studied piano and theory from 1958-1964.<ref>\"Zaimont,\" in ''International Encyclopedia of Women Composers'', 773.</ref>  These lessons included piano with [[Rosina Lh\u00e9vinne]] and theory and duo-piano with Ann Hull.  Judith and Doris had a successful performance career as duo-pianists that included appearances on Lawrence Welk's and Mitch Miller's television programs and a Carnegie Hall debut in 1963.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>\n\nJudith's musical ability was observed at an early age.  Family members recall her singing in her sleep when she was a child.  She also had an incredible ability to play by ear and sight read.<ref>Adams, \"All-American Appeal,\" 39.</ref>  She was drawn to the art of composing after performing Chopin.  She was not fond of practicing since she did not like to play the same notes over and over.  She states, \"I like to mess around with the notes.\"<ref>Zaimont, \"Imaging,\" 167.</ref>  She began her compositional attempts at age eleven and won first place from the National Federation of Music Clubs for a piece written when she was only twelve.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>\n\n== Education and teaching experiences ==\nAs Zaimont continued her education, she received a diploma from the Long Island Institute of Music in 1966, a bachelor's degree from [[Queens College]] in 1968, and a master's degree in 1978 from [[Columbia University]].<ref>\"Zaimont,\" in ''International Encyclopedia of Women Composers'', 773.</ref>  She studied composition with [[Hugo Weisgall]] and [[Jack Beeson]] at Queens College and later studied with [[Otto Luening]] while at Columbia.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>  She also traveled to France through a fellowship in order to study orchestration with [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet]].<ref>Reel, \"Conversations with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>  She has taught at the [[Peabody Conservatory of Music]], [[Adelphi University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>Butterworth, ''Dictionary'', 509.</ref>  She is currently retired.\n\n== Musical style ==\nZaimont's music reflects earlier compositional styles.  Much of her music incorporates elements from [[Romanticism]] and [[Impressionism]], as well as including 20th century techniques.  Her music is broadly tonal and emphasizes recognizable structure.<ref>Adams, \"All-American Appeal,\" 42.</ref>  She prides herself on the ability to have recognizable form and yet still be creative.  One of Zaimont's most recognizable compositional characteristics is her use of complex rhythms and sudden meter changes.  She writes that rhythm is the most important element giving cohesion to a piece.  She obscures the expected arrival of the downbeat, as well as incorporates an increased pulse of the music.  She also includes cross rhythms.<ref>Agay, ''Art of Teaching Piano'', 361-362.</ref>\n\nZaimont writes that her melodies are more instrumentally inspired than vocally inspired.  This instrumental emphasis includes aspects of asymmetrical lines, octave displacement, as well as a more linear approach.<ref>Agay, ''Art of Teaching Piano'', 369.</ref>  She includes changes of character, dance rhythms, and programmatic titles in several of her works, as her pieces often draw on elements of nature, which is an inspiration for her writing.<ref>Canfield, \"Step by Step,\" 64.</ref>  Zaimont describes her style as \"highly dramatic with non-traditional but tonal underpinnings.\"  As Zaimont writes, \"My style is essentially chromatic and non-contrapuntal.\"<ref>Zaimont, \"The Musical Woman,\" 439-440.</ref>  She also places importance on texture and has a strong ability to write idiomatically for all instruments, which is a result of her strong sense of inner hearing.  She was forced to rely on this when an operation for otosclerosis in 1984 left her with hearing loss in her left ear.  \"When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't hear birds. And I haven't heard them through natural hearing ever since.\"<ref>Dunn, \"Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 15.</ref>\n\n== Musical influences ==\nZaimont was influenced by several well-known composers, including [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland|Copland]].  Her main attraction to these composers was their characterizing use of texture, fast harmonic rhythm, and figuration.<ref>Canfield, \"Step by Step,\" 64.</ref>  She states, \"I prefer textures where there's a lot of 'stuff.'  And since I do write melodies, the textures need to be lucid, with surfaces worked sufficiently to characterize the materials.  I've been called a Romantic Modernist, and that's pretty accurate.\"<ref>Canfield, \"Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 65.</ref> Her early influence of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] and [[Jazz]] can be heard in her earlier works.  She also has a love of French music, especially Debussy, as well as music with text.  Although one should have composers of influence, Zaimont believes it is very important for a composer to find his or her unique voice.<ref>Reel, \"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>\n\n== Musical impact ==\nJudith Lang Zaimont has also done much to draw attention to the challenges of female composers.  Although she persistently promotes women composers, she does not like being referred to as a woman composer.  \"I never heard the term 'adjective-composer' until 1972, when I was on Bob Sherman's radio show in New York, and he asked me what it was like to be a 'woman composer.'  There was dead air on the tape right at that spot, because I'd never thought of myself as any kind of adjective composer.  I have special observations about being labeled a woman composer, but I keep them to myself.\"<ref>Reel, \"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>\n\nShe has also addressed the absence of women composers in the repertoire of teaching materials.  She believes that students are not exposed to female composers, especially living ones, throughout their course of study.  She has attempted to urge teachers to include more female composers and new music in their students' college repertoire.<ref>Strempel, \"Woman Composer Question,\" 171.</ref>  Zaimont has made an effort to include herself in this area and has written for several ability levels.  She has also served as the head editor of the series ''The Musical Woman: An International Perspective''.  These books were published because women composers of the past were being overlooked.  Thus, another major accomplishment is her record of publications, which includes the previous series and several other articles.\n\n== Awards ==\n*[[National Federation of Music Clubs]], 10 prizes (1962\u20131970)\n\n*Debussy Fellowship of the Alliance Fran\u00e7oise (1971\u20131972)\n\n*MacDowell Fellowship (1971 and 1976)\n\n*[[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (1983)\n\n*[[International Alliance for Women in Music]] Recording Award for Neon Rhythm (1995)\n\n*Honored Composer at the [[Van Cliburn International Competition]] (2001)\n \n*Aaron Copland Award (2003)<ref>Jun, \"Compositional Style of Judith Lang Zaimont.\"</ref>\n\n*Gottschalk Centenary Composition Gold Medal for ''Man's Image and His Cry'' (1969)\n\n*[[National Endowment for the Arts]] (1982)\n\n*McCollin International Composition Competition First Prize for ''Symphony no.1'' (1995)\n\n*BMI Young Composer Award for ''Four Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Piano'' (1996)\n\n*Artist Fellowship in Music Composition-[[Bush Foundation]] (2005)<ref>Randall, \"Zaimont,\" ''Grove Music Online''.</ref>\n\n==Works==\nA complete works list can be found at [http://www.jzaimont.com/works/works.html].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Adams, Clinton. \"All-American Appeal.\" ''Piano & Keyboard'' 195, no. 1 (Nov. 1998): 39-43.

Both Zaimont and her sister, Doris Lang Kosloff, began piano lessons with their mother, Bertha Lang, who was an accomplished pianist and singer.  Bertha was very active in the music profession and served as a president of the New York State Music Teachers Association. Judith began lessons at [[Juilliard]] at age 12, where she studied piano and theory from 1958-1964.<ref>\"Zaimont,\" in ''International Encyclopedia of Women Composers'', 773.</ref>  These lessons included piano with [[Rosina Lh\u00e9vinne]] and theory and duo-piano with Ann Hull.  Judith and Doris had a successful performance career as duo-pianists that included appearances on Lawrence Welk's and Mitch Miller's television programs and a Carnegie Hall debut in 1963.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>\n\nJudith's musical ability was observed at an early age.  Family members recall her singing in her sleep when she was a child.  She also had an incredible ability to play by ear and sight read.<ref>Adams, \"All-American Appeal,\" 39.</ref>  She was drawn to the art of composing after performing Chopin.  She was not fond of practicing since she did not like to play the same notes over and over.  She states, \"I like to mess around with the notes.\"<ref>Zaimont, \"Imaging,\" 167.</ref>  She began her compositional attempts at age eleven and won first place from the National Federation of Music Clubs for a piece written when she was only twelve.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>\n\n== Education and teaching experiences ==\nAs Zaimont continued her education, she received a diploma from the Long Island Institute of Music in 1966, a bachelor's degree from [[Queens College]] in 1968, and a master's degree in 1978 from [[Columbia University]].<ref>\"Zaimont,\" in ''International Encyclopedia of Women Composers'', 773.</ref>  She studied composition with [[Hugo Weisgall]] and [[Jack Beeson]] at Queens College and later studied with [[Otto Luening]] while at Columbia.<ref>Ramney, \"Zaimont,\" 685.</ref>  She also traveled to France through a fellowship in order to study orchestration with [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet]].<ref>Reel, \"Conversations with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>  She has taught at the [[Peabody Conservatory of Music]], [[Adelphi University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>Butterworth, ''Dictionary'', 509.</ref>  She is currently retired.\n\n== Musical style ==\nZaimont's music reflects earlier compositional styles.  Much of her music incorporates elements from [[Romanticism]] and [[Impressionism]], as well as including 20th century techniques.  Her music is broadly tonal and emphasizes recognizable structure.<ref>Adams, \"All-American Appeal,\" 42.</ref>  She prides herself on the ability to have recognizable form and yet still be creative.  One of Zaimont's most recognizable compositional characteristics is her use of complex rhythms and sudden meter changes.  She writes that rhythm is the most important element giving cohesion to a piece.  She obscures the expected arrival of the downbeat, as well as incorporates an increased pulse of the music.  She also includes cross rhythms.<ref>Agay, ''Art of Teaching Piano'', 361-362.</ref>\n\nZaimont writes that her melodies are more instrumentally inspired than vocally inspired.  This instrumental emphasis includes aspects of asymmetrical lines, octave displacement, as well as a more linear approach.<ref>Agay, ''Art of Teaching Piano'', 369.</ref>  She includes changes of character, dance rhythms, and programmatic titles in several of her works, as her pieces often draw on elements of nature, which is an inspiration for her writing.<ref>Canfield, \"Step by Step,\" 64.</ref>  Zaimont describes her style as \"highly dramatic with non-traditional but tonal underpinnings.\"  As Zaimont writes, \"My style is essentially chromatic and non-contrapuntal.\"<ref>Zaimont, \"The Musical Woman,\" 439-440.</ref>  She also places importance on texture and has a strong ability to write idiomatically for all instruments, which is a result of her strong sense of inner hearing.  She was forced to rely on this when an operation for otosclerosis in 1984 left her with hearing loss in her left ear.  \"When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't hear birds. And I haven't heard them through natural hearing ever since.\"<ref>Dunn, \"Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 15.</ref>\n\n== Musical influences ==\nZaimont was influenced by several well-known composers, including [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland|Copland]].  Her main attraction to these composers was their characterizing use of texture, fast harmonic rhythm, and figuration.<ref>Canfield, \"Step by Step,\" 64.</ref>  She states, \"I prefer textures where there's a lot of 'stuff.'  And since I do write melodies, the textures need to be lucid, with surfaces worked sufficiently to characterize the materials.  I've been called a Romantic Modernist, and that's pretty accurate.\"<ref>Canfield, \"Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 65.</ref> Her early influence of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] and [[Jazz]] can be heard in her earlier works.  She also has a love of French music, especially Debussy, as well as music with text.  Although one should have composers of influence, Zaimont believes it is very important for a composer to find his or her unique voice.<ref>Reel, \"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>\n\n== Musical impact ==\nJudith Lang Zaimont has also done much to draw attention to the challenges of female composers.  Although she persistently promotes women composers, she does not like being referred to as a woman composer.  \"I never heard the term 'adjective-composer' until 1972, when I was on Bob Sherman's radio show in New York, and he asked me what it was like to be a 'woman composer.'  There was dead air on the tape right at that spot, because I'd never thought of myself as any kind of adjective composer.  I have special observations about being labeled a woman composer, but I keep them to myself.\"<ref>Reel, \"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont,\" 31.</ref>\n\nShe has also addressed the absence of women composers in the repertoire of teaching materials.  She believes that students are not exposed to female composers, especially living ones, throughout their course of study.  She has attempted to urge teachers to include more female composers and new music in their students' college repertoire.<ref>Strempel, \"Woman Composer Question,\" 171.</ref>  Zaimont has made an effort to include herself in this area and has written for several ability levels.  She has also served as the head editor of the series ''The Musical Woman: An International Perspective''.  These books were published because women composers of the past were being overlooked.  Thus, another major accomplishment is her record of publications, which includes the previous series and several other articles.\n\n== Awards ==\n*[[National Federation of Music Clubs]], 10 prizes (1962\u20131970)\n\n*Debussy Fellowship of the Alliance Fran\u00e7oise (1971\u20131972)\n\n*MacDowell Fellowship (1971 and 1976)\n\n*[[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (1983)\n\n*[[International Alliance for Women in Music]] Recording Award for Neon Rhythm (1995)\n\n*Honored Composer at the [[Van Cliburn International Competition]] (2001)\n \n*Aaron Copland Award (2003)<ref>Jun, \"Compositional Style of Judith Lang Zaimont.\"</ref>\n\n*Gottschalk Centenary Composition Gold Medal for ''Man's Image and His Cry'' (1969)\n\n*[[National Endowment for the Arts]] (1982)\n\n*McCollin International Composition Competition First Prize for ''Symphony no.1'' (1995)\n\n*BMI Young Composer Award for ''Four Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Piano'' (1996)\n\n*Artist Fellowship in Music Composition-[[Bush Foundation]] (2005)<ref>Randall, \"Zaimont,\" ''Grove Music Online''.</ref>\n\n==Works==\nA complete works list can be found at [http://www.jzaimont.com/works/works.html].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Adams, Clinton. \"All-American Appeal.\" ''Piano & Keyboard'' 195, no. 1 (Nov. 1998): 39-43.

It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name=\"Mojapelo2008\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1\u2013 |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is \"music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music.

By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\n\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Detroit ([[Motown]]) style, a more [[pop music|pop]]-friendly and rhythmic style; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; as well as [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Gospel music articles}}\n[[File:Ray_Charles_classic_piano_pose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Charles]] pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles]]\nSoul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles \u2013 in both lyrical content and instrumentation \u2013 that began in the 1950s.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first=Julia |last=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |ISBN=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary.

The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]].

[[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are an example of later developments influenced by soul music. \n\nSeveral terms were introduced, such as \"blue-eyed soul\", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades.

To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music.

It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name=\"Mojapelo2008\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1\u2013 |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is \"music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music.

By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\n\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Detroit ([[Motown]]) style, a more [[pop music|pop]]-friendly and rhythmic style; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; as well as [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Gospel music articles}}\n[[File:Ray_Charles_classic_piano_pose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Charles]] pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles]]\nSoul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles \u2013 in both lyrical content and instrumentation \u2013 that began in the 1950s.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first=Julia |last=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |ISBN=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

Ertegun wrote many songs for [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Clovers]].

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Hypersoul ===\nHyper soul is a medley of soul and dance music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180 |title=What is Hypersoul? (2001) - Riddim.ca |website=Riddim.ca |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style, but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, and heightened sexuality and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism.  It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.\n\n=== Nu-jazz and soul-influenced electronica ===\n{{further|Nu jazz|Electronica}}\nMany artists in various genres of [[electronic music]] (such as [[House music|house]], [[drum n bass]], [[UK garage]], and [[downtempo]]) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Non-black Americans in soul music ===\n{{further|Non-black Americans in soul music}}\nThe impact of soul music was manifold; both domestic non-black and international artists were influenced by soul music. [[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are an example of later developments influenced by soul music. \n\nSeveral terms were introduced, such as \"blue-eyed soul\", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name=\"pc52\">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Vali]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nAnother term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"ALLmu\">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].

Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the [[funk]]-influenced Philadelphia soul, or [[Philly soul|\"Philly\" soul]]. The West Coast [[Chicano rock|Latin rock]] scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]] (\"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\") and [[Thee Midniters]] played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious [[rock and roll]] edge. Many of these artists drew from the [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]] scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were \"some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s.\"<ref name=ALLmu/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States|R&B and Soul Music}}\n* [[List of soul musicians]]\n* [[Funk]]\n* [[Disco]]\n* [[Music of the United States]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Adams, Michael (2008).

Directed by [[Rory Quintos]], Dado Lumibao, and [[Olivia Lamasan]], the series stars [[Kathryn Bernardo]] and [[Daniel Padilla]] as Yna Macaspac and Angelo Buenavista, together with an ensemble cast consisting of [[Jodi Sta. Maria]], [[Angelica Panganiban]], [[Ian Veneracion]], [[Amy Austria-Ventura]], [[Ronnie Lazaro]], [[Andrea Brillantes]], [[Diego Loyzaga]], [[Dominic Roque]], [[Bernard Palanca]], and [[Joem Bascon]]. [[Jodi Sta. Maria]], who portrays Amor Powers, was part of the original 2000 television series and played Lia Buenavista.\n\n== Plot == \nThe story begins with Amor ([[Jodi Sta. Maria]]), a nursing student whose dream was to become a chef. She was a scholar of Buena Mines, a mining company owned by the Buenavista family, in the town of Punta Verde. To aid her family with expenses, she cooks and sells food to generate income. She frequently sells her food at the Buena Mines corporate offices, where Eduardo ([[Ian Veneracion]]), the eldest Buenavista son, works.\n\nAmor confronts Eduardo regarding the mining of her hometown that kills workers and is afraid that more people, including her father, would be casualties. Amor and Eduardo then develop a friendship that turns into romance, much to his younger brother, Diego's ([[Bernard Palanca]]), despair. Meanwhile, Do\u00f1a Benita Buenavista ([[Pilar Pilapil]]) refuses to accept Amor and Eduardo's relationship. She forces Eduardo to marry Claudia Salameda ([[Angelica Panganiban]]), the illegitimate child of the incumbent governor of Punta Verde for business purposes.\n\nClaudia has lived with her physically impaired mother and was joyous of having to marry Eduardo for a better life, even though she is in love with Simon ([[Alex Medina]]). She promises Simon that she will continue seeing him once she is married. Eduardo refuses to marry Claudia, and Diego puts himself forward to marry Claudia instead for the family. Claudia becomes upset and consummates her love with Simon&nbsp;\u2014 Eduardo consummates with Amor.\n\nAfter publicly announcing the engagement of Eduardo and Claudia without knowledge and consent, Amor becomes heartbroken. Diego rushes to her side. He visits her constantly to explain that his brother was not at fault. One day, he picks her up from school and insists that he just wants to comfort her. He becomes drunk, admits that he has always been in love with her and rapes her. Meanwhile, Claudia has followed the two and witnessed the entire scene, not stopping Diego.\n\nDiego is put to prison and is influenced by his mother not to tell Eduardo the truth. Desperate not to be jailed, Diego insists Amor was lying and he did not rape her. Amor goes to Eduardo against her father, Pepe's ([[Boboy Garovillo]]), and best friend, Betty Mae's ([[Erika Padilla]]), wishes. She asks him if he believes her. Eduardo, hurt by his previous relationship, could not make up his mind. However, during his engagement party, he realized that he could not leave Amor and rushes to her house to beg her to forgive him only to find out that he was too late. The de Jesus family no longer lived there, unknown to him that his mother, Do\u00f1a Benita, evicted Amor and her family from the town.\n\nAmor learns she is pregnant. She lives a quiet life with her family and daughter named Maria Amor. She leaves Maria Amor to her stepmother, Chayong (Sharmaine Suarez), Pepe, stepbrother Lester (Jess Mendoza), and younger sister Neneth (Kimberly Fulgar), and goes to [[Hong Kong]] as a caregiver to fulfill her dream of giving her family a stable life.\n\nThe Buenavistas' mining company, now managed by Claudia Buenavista, has been mining in Talimpao, the town where Amor's family now resides. Claudia refuses to listen to the warnings of dangers of the mine and forces the miners to work&nbsp;\u2014 causing a landslide to occur. The landslide kills Amor's entire family&nbsp;\u2014 except her daughter, Maria Amor, who has been saved by a lowly policeman, Francisco Macaspac ([[Ronnie Lazaro]]). She is named \"Yna\" by the policeman, after noticing the broken necklace she wore&nbsp;\u2014 \"Yna\", originally \"Ynamorata\", a gift of promise from Eduardo to Amor.\n\nMaria Amor was misidentified by Betty Mae when she saw the dead bodies of Amor's stepmother and her neighbor, Irma's (Rubi Rubi), daughter. She tells Amor that her entire family has died. Amor returns to the [[Philippines]] and also to the now-ruined Talimpao, swearing that one day she will avenge all that has happened to her family.\n\nTwenty years later, Maria Amor&nbsp;\u2014 now Yna Macaspac ([[Kathryn Bernardo]]), is as kindhearted and hard working as her biological mother, Amor. The Macaspac family that adopted her is poor but good mannered.\n\nEduardo, who is now the governor of Punta Verde, and Claudia have two children: Angelo ([[Daniel Padilla]]) and Lia ([[Andrea Brillantes]]). Fate brings Yna to Angelo.\n\nJust like her mother, Amor, Yna's passion is cooking. She works a chef in Angelo's restaurant, Casa Corazon. Angelo's restaurant gives Yna scholarship to properly study. Soon Angelo and Yna fall in love&nbsp;\u2014 and despite Claudia's attempts to ruin and sabotage Yna&nbsp;\u2014 fights for their love together.\n\nMeanwhile, Amor returns to the Philippines from the [[United States]] as Amor Powers, a widow of a wealthy but abusive [[Americans|American]] businessman named James Powers (uncredited). Amor has returned to avenge the death of her family by destroying the Buenavistas, which unwittingly will hurt her own daughter, Yna, in the process. An all-out war begins between Amor Powers and Claudia Buenavista.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = ABS-CBNnews.com | title = Pangako Sa'Yo Remake: How Did It Fare? | url = http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/17952/how-did-pangako-sa-39yo-remake-fare-in-the-ratings-game | accessdate = 8 May 2015 | date = May 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Kathryn Bernardo]] as Yna Macaspac / Maria Amor de Jesus\n* [[Daniel Padilla]] as Angelo Buenavista\n* [[Jodi Sta.

While [[RCD Mallorca]] (then called ''Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII FC'') was considered the team of the powerful, [[CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares]] (then ''Baleares FC'') was born from workers and workers sectors of the city. This character is very diluted at present and both clubs are much more heterogeneous than in the beginning, but the foundational character is still very present when defining the rivalry between groups of supporters.\n\nTheir rivalry has remained very alive at street level, despite being clubs at very different sporting levels from the 1960s onwards - and especially since the 1980s, when Mallorca made a significant improvement and became a regular in the [[La Liga|Primera]] and [[Segunda Division]]s, while Atl\u00e9tico Baleares remained in the lower [[Segunda Division B]] and [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2016/05/el-atletico-baleares-patrimonio-del-futbol-balear-y-mallorquin/ | title=El Atl\u00e9tico Baleares, patrimonio del f\u00fatbol balear (y mallorqu\u00edn) | work=Cuadernos de F\u00fatbol, n\u00ba 76 | date=1 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first confrontation took place on 31 March 13, 1921 between the second team of [[RCD Mallorca|Alfonso XIII FC]] and the first of [[CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares|Baleares FC]] in the stadium of ''Bons Aires'', property of the ''alfonsinos''. The match ended early in the midst of a pitched battle between players and the public through, when the ''alfonsinos'' won by 2 goals to 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arabalears.cat/societat/Mallorca-Balears-Constancia-futbol-Part-Forana-rivalitat_0_2256974333.html | title=Mallorca vs. At. Balears: una rivalitat de classes | work=Ara Balears | date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry has been maintained for almost a century through the successive names of the two clubs. By the ''mallorcanists'', ''RS Alfonso XIII FC'' (from 1916 to 1931), ''CD Mallorca'' (1931-1949) and ''RCD Mallorca'' (since 1949). On the part of the ''balearics'', ''Baleares FC'' (from 1920 to 1942) and ''CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares'' (since 1942).\n\nAt the supramunicipal level, for a time two clubs shared rivalry with a third team: the [[CD Constancia]] of the neighboring population of [[Inca]], especially until the 1960s. In the other  islands of the Balearic archipelago, the main rivals were [[SD Ibiza]] (from the capital of the [[Pityusic Islands]], [[Ibiza (city)|Ibiza]]) and [[UD Mah\u00f3n]] (from the capital of [[Minorca]]). The aforementioned rise in sporting achievement that RCD Mallorca had from the 1960s reduced all these rivalries to a minimum, except that with Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\n\nThe last derby, played in 2018 in [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B]], aroused great excitement and showed that the rivalry is still very much alive.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2018/apr/04/real-mallorca-atletico-baleares-derby-liga-majorca | title=Real Mallorca v Atl\u00e9tico Baleares: the derby that disappeared for 37 years  | work=The Guardian | date=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== League matches ==\n\n<small>Only clashes between first teams are listed.

While [[RCD Mallorca]] (then called ''Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII FC'') was considered the team of the powerful, [[CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares]] (then ''Baleares FC'') was born from workers and workers sectors of the city. This character is very diluted at present and both clubs are much more heterogeneous than in the beginning, but the foundational character is still very present when defining the rivalry between groups of supporters.\n\nTheir rivalry has remained very alive at street level, despite being clubs at very different sporting levels from the 1960s onwards - and especially since the 1980s, when Mallorca made a significant improvement and became a regular in the [[La Liga|Primera]] and [[Segunda Division]]s, while Atl\u00e9tico Baleares remained in the lower [[Segunda Division B]] and [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2016/05/el-atletico-baleares-patrimonio-del-futbol-balear-y-mallorquin/ | title=El Atl\u00e9tico Baleares, patrimonio del f\u00fatbol balear (y mallorqu\u00edn) | work=Cuadernos de F\u00fatbol, n\u00ba 76 | date=1 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first confrontation took place on 31 March 13 1921 between the second team of [[RCD Mallorca|Alfonso XIII FC]] and the first of [[CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares|Baleares FC]] in the stadium of ''Bons Aires'', property of the ''alfonsinos''. The match ended early in the midst of a pitched battle between players and the public through, when the ''alfonsinos'' won by 2 goals to 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arabalears.cat/societat/Mallorca-Balears-Constancia-futbol-Part-Forana-rivalitat_0_2256974333.html | title=Mallorca vs. At. Balears: una rivalitat de classes | work=Ara Balears | date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry has been maintained for almost a century through the successive names of the two clubs. By the ''mallorcanists'', ''RS Alfonso XIII FC'' (from 1916 to 1931), ''CD Mallorca'' (1931-1949) and ''RCD Mallorca'' (since 1949). On the part of the ''balearics'', ''Baleares FC'' (from 1920 to 1942) and ''CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares'' (since 1942).\n\nAt the supramunicipal level, for a time two clubs shared rivalry with a third team: the [[CD Constancia]] of the neighboring population of [[Inca]], especially until the 1960s. In the other  islands of the Balearic archipelago, the main rivals were [[SD Ibiza]] (from the capital of the [[Pityusic Islands]], [[Ibiza (city)|Ibiza]]) and [[UD Mah\u00f3n]] (from the capital of [[Minorca]]). The aforementioned rise in sporting achievement that RCD Mallorca had from the 1960s reduced all these rivalries to a minimum, except that with Atl\u00e9tico Baleares.\n\nThe last derby, played in 2018 in [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B]], aroused great excitement and showed that the rivalry is still very much alive.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2018/apr/04/real-mallorca-atletico-baleares-derby-liga-majorca | title=Real Mallorca v Atl\u00e9tico Baleares: the derby that disappeared for 37 years  | work=The Guardian | date=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== League matches ==\n\n<small>Only clashes between first teams are listed.
