{"title_page": "Jean-Pierre Brisset", "text_new": "[[File:Brisset Banquet.jpg|thumb|The Prince of Thinkers welcomed and applauded in Paris.]]\n'''Jean-Pierre Brisset''' (October 30 1837\u2013September 2 1919) was a [[France|French]] outsider writer.\n==Biography==\nBorn into a farming family of [[La Sauvag\u00e8re]], Brisset was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]]. Having left school at age twelve to help on the family farm, he apprenticed as a pastry chef in Paris three years later. In 1855, he enlisted in the army for seven years and fought in the [[Crimean War]]. In 1859, during the war in [[Italy]] against the [[Austria|Austrian]]s. After he was wounded at the [[Battle of Magenta]], he was taken prisoner. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was a second lieutenant in the 50<sup>e</sup> r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne. Taken prisoner again, he was sent to [[Magdeburg]] in [[Saxony]] where he learned [[German language|German]].\n\nIn 1871, he published ''La natation ou l\u2019art de nager appris seul en moins d\u2019une heure'' (''Learning the art of swimming alone in less than an hour''), then resigned from the Army and moved to [[Marseilles]]. Here he filed a [[patent]] for the \"airlift swimming trunks and belt with a double compensatory reservoir\". This commercial endeavor was a complete failure. He returned to Magdeburg, where he earned his living as a language teacher, developing a method for learning French, which he [[self-published]] in 1874.\n\nBrisset became [[stationmaster]] at the [[railway station]] of [[Angers]], and later of [[L'Aigle]]. After publishing another book on the French language, he undertook his major philosophical work, in which contended that humans were descended from [[frogs]]. Brisset supported his contention by comparing the French and frog languages (such as \"logement\" = dwelling, comes from \"l'eau\" = water). He was serious about his \"morosophy\", and authored a number of books and pamphlets put forth his indisputable substantiations, which he had printed and distributed at his own expense.\n\nIn 1912, novelist [[Jules Romains]], who had obtained copies of ''God's Mystery'' and ''The Human Origins'', set up, with the help of fellow hoaxers, a rigged election for a \"Prince of Thinkers\". Unsurprisingly, Brisset got elected. The Election Committee then called Brisset to Paris in 1913, where he was received and acclaimed with great pomp. He partook in several ceremonies and a banquet and uttered emotional words of thanks for this unexpected late recognition of his work. Newspapers exposed the [[hoax]] the next day.  \n\nIn 1919, Brisset died, aged 81, at [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]].\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nThe ''Complete Works'' of Brisset were reprinted by Marc D\u00e9cimo, Dijon, Les Presses du r\u00e9el, 2001. In an essay entitled, ''Jean-Pierre Brisset, Prince des Penseurs, inventeur, grammairien et proph\u00e8te'', Dijon, Les presses du r\u00e9el, 2001, Marc D\u00e9cimo has given a biography, explanations about Brisset's delirium about frogs as ancestors of humankind. Translations in several languages (European languages, Wolof, Armenian, Arabic, Houma, etc.) can be found in this book as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It also includes the major texts written about Brisset by Jules Romains, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Michel Foucault]]. In 2004 the ''Art of Swimming'' (as a frog) was published in paperback.\n\nAround 2001, [[Ernestine Chasseb\u0153uf]] wrote several letters to French politicians, universities, railway stations, library directors, psychiatric hospitals, to suggest they name a street, a university, etc. after Brisset. Their answers were published on a website dedicated to him,<ref>[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/chambernac/brisset.htm Website about Jean-Pierre Brisset] at pagesperso-orange.fr</ref> but there is no \"rue Jean-Pierre Brisset\" yet. Thanks to a bequest to Jules Romain, an annual dinner in his memory was made possible until 1939.\n\nBrisset is listed as a saint on the [['Pataphysics]] calendar. His writings were in print as of 2004.\n\n==Works==\n* ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes'', Les Presses du r\u00e9el, collection L'\u00e9cart absolu, Dijon, 2001 et 2<sup>e</sup> \u00e9d. 2004.\n* ''\u0152uvres natatoires'', Les Presses du r\u00e9el, collection L'\u00e9cart absolu - poche, Dijon, 2001.\n* ''La Grande nouvelle'', \u00c9dition en fac simil\u00e9 du Cymbalum Pataphysicum.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brisset, Jean-Pierre}}\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Orne]]\n[[Category:19th-century French writers]]\n[[Category:French male writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century French male writers]]\n[[Category:Outsider literature]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Brisset Banquet.jpg|thumb|The Prince of Thinkers welcomed and applauded in Paris.]]\n'''Jean-Pierre Brisset''' (October 30 1837\u2013September 2 1919) was a [[France|French]] outsider writer.\n==Biography==\nBorn into a farming family of [[La Sauvag\u00e8re]], Brisset was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]].

Newspapers exposed the [[hoax]] the next day.  \n\nIn 1919, Brisset died, aged 81, at [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]].\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nThe ''Complete Works'' of Brisset were reprinted by Marc D\u00e9cimo, Dijon, Les Presses du r\u00e9el, 2001.

In 2004 the ''Art of Swimming'' (as a frog) was published in paperback.\n\nAround 2001, [[Ernestine Chasseb\u0153uf]] wrote several letters to French politicians, universities, railway stations, library directors, psychiatric hospitals, to suggest they name a street, a university, etc. after Brisset. Their answers were published on a website dedicated to him,<ref>[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/chambernac/brisset.htm Website about Jean-Pierre Brisset] at pagesperso-orange.fr</ref> but there is no \"rue Jean-Pierre Brisset\" yet.

The government's policies generally support the free practice of religion in the country, and it provides funding to religious organizations and anti-discrimination programs on a regular basis. According to [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and the [[Norwegian Police Service|Norwegian police]], religiously motivated hate speech is prevalent, particularly online, and primarily targeting the Muslim and Jewish communities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe origins of the modern Kingdom of Norway can be traced to the kingdoms established by Vikings during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[Muslims]] comprise 2.9 percent of the population. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], and [[Judaism|Jews]] each make up less than 1 percent of the population.

Immigrants from [[Poland]] and the [[Philippines]] have increased the number of Catholics, while those from such countries as [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]] have increased the size of the Muslim community. Catholics and Muslims generally have greater representation in cities than in rural areas. Muslims are located throughout the country, but the population is concentrated in the [[Oslo]] region. Many recent immigrants from Muslim majority countries still reside in asylum reception centers. According to [[Norwegian Directorate of Immigration]] statistics, approximately 5,600 of the 6,300 persons residing in reception centers as of October 2017 come from Muslim majority countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Norway}}\n=== Unification and Christianization of the Kingdom of Norway (10th c.

The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\".

Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Perdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly.

The PIC/S is meant as an instrument to improve co-operation in the field of [[Good Manufacturing Practice]]s between [[Regulatory Authority|regulatory authorities]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]].\n\nThe PIC (Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention) was founded in October 1970 by the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), under the title of the ''Convention for the Mutual Recognition of Inspections in Respect of the Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products''. The initial members comprised the 10 member countries of EFTA at that time. In the early 1990s it was realized that because of an incompatibility between the Convention and [[European law]], it was not possible for new countries to be admitted as members of PIC. European law did not permit individual EU countries that were members of PIC to sign agreements with other countries seeking to join PIC. As a consequence the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme was formed on 2 November 1995. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme is an informal agreement between health authorities instead of a formal treaty between countries. PIC and the PIC Scheme, which operate together in parallel, are jointly referred to as PIC/S.

The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==List of Chairpersons of Benazir Income Support Program==\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!align=center|Name of Chairperson\n!align=center|Entered Office\n!align=center|Left Office\n|-\n|[[Farzana Raja]]\n|July 2008\n|March 2013\n|-\n|Vacant\n|March 2013\n|November 2013\n|-\n|[[Enver Baig]]\n|November 2013\n|November 2014\n|-\n|Vacant\n|November 2014\n|February 2015\n|-\n|[[Marvi Memon]]\n|February 2015\n|June 2018\n|-\n|Vacant\n|June 2018\n|October 2018\n|-\n|[[Sania Nishtar]]\n|October 2018\n|Present\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==List of Chairpersons of Benazir Income Support Program==\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!align=center|Name of Chairperson\n!align=center|Entered Office\n!align=center|Left Office\n|-\n|[[Farzana Raja]]\n|July 2008\n|March 2013\n|-\n|Vacant\n|March 2013\n|November 2013\n|-\n|[[Enver Baig]]\n|November 2013\n|November 2014\n|-\n|Vacant\n|November 2014\n|February 2015\n|-\n|[[Marvi Memon]]\n|February 2015\n|June 2018\n|-\n|Vacant\n|June 2018\n|October 2018\n|-\n|[[Sania Nishtar]]\n|October 2018\n|Present\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world, losing only to the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]]. On 9 January 2018, the Department of Health was renamed the Department of Health and Social Care.

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs).

In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge.

There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector.

The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The [[London Ambulance Service]] was to be a computer-aided dispatch system.

A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.

Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world, losing only to the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company for the Department of Health shows that every \u00a3200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.<ref>{{cite web | author=George Monbiot | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off |date=10 March 2002 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 7 September 2006 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]| author-link=George Monbiot }}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was also required to take on pro-active socially \"directive\" policies, for example, in respect of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[obesity]].\n\n=== Information technology ===\nIn the 1980s and 90s, NHS IT spent money on several failed IT projects. The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The [[London Ambulance Service]] was to be a computer-aided dispatch system.

A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.  It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service.  Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.

There had been improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care.

Because of the genre's similarities with Barcadi, some people assert the genre began in the [[Pretoria]] area with DJ Mojava which was made popular by Pretoria taxi drivers by the likes of the late Wallash(CBF) & Soshanguve Universal Taxi Rank\n,and has been an on going debate about the origin of Amapiano.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2019-07-07-amapiano-a-township-sound-with-staying-power/|title=Amapiano: a township sound with staying power|website=TimesLIVE|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Joyce |first1=Liam Karabo |title=Meet the vocalist featured on the biggest amapiano tracks |url=https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/music/local/meet-the-vocalist-featured-on-the-biggest-amapiano-tracks-35610310 |publisher=Independent Online |accessdate=1 November 2019 |date=23 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sundayworld/lifestyle/2019-05-28-amapiano-a-new-movement-period/|title=Amapiano a new movement...

The sound itself was underground music, being shared around using messaging apps, more commonly [[WhatsApp]], before it became mainstream being recognised by streaming services such as [[Deezer]], [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]]. The genre was further popularised by DJ's who would transform popular music hits and incorporating the jazzy low-tempo into those tracks, including DJ Ganyani, Sun-El Musician, [[DJ Maphorisa]] and [[Kabza De Small]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopza.com/dj-maphorisa-kabza-de-small-scorpion-kings-live-at-sun-arena-11-april/|title= Dj Maphorisa & Kabza De Small \u2013 Scorpion Kings Live at Sun Arena 11 April|website=Hiphopza|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nAmapiano is getting more mainstream across Africa as of 2020, there are several dedicated charts now, more playlists on digital platforms not just by South Africans alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tinamag.com/songs/amapiano/|title=Amapiano 2020: Download New Amapiano Mix,Songs,Music Video Fakaza|website=TINAMAG.COM|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zkhiphani.co.za/2019-the-year-of-the-yanos-how-amapiano-blow-up/|title=2019 The Year Of The Yanos, How Amapiano Blow up|last=Machaieie|first=Mario|date=2019-10-21|website=Online Youth Magazine {{!}} Zkhiphani.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Amapiano |title=Top Amapiano Songs 2020 |url=https://www.amapiano.org/download-mp3/top-10-list-of-amapiano-tracks-songs-2019-hottest/ |website=Amapiano.Org |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe sound is filled with some melodious piano tunes coupled with gong gong sound making it up to what is called \u201dAmapiano\u201d.
