The teeth or splines of the gear are progressively cut into the material (a flat, cylindrical piece of metal) by a series of cuts made by a [[cutting tool (metalworking)|cutting tool]] called a '''hob'''. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.<ref>{{harvnb|American Society for Metals|Cubberly|Bardes|1978|p=334}}.</ref>\n\nIt is the most widely used gear cutting process for creating spur and helical gears<ref>{{harvnb|Drozda|Wick|Benedict|Veilleux|Society of Manufacturing Engineers|Bakerjian|1983|p=13\u201034<!-- Not a range -->}}.</ref> and more gears are cut by hobbing than any other process as it is relatively quick and inexpensive.<ref name=\"todd\">{{harvnb|Todd|Allen|Alting|1994|pp=59\u201360}}.</ref>\n\nA type of [[skiving machine|skiving]] that is analogous to the hobbing of external gears can be applied to the cutting of internal gears, which are skived with a rotary cutter (rather than [[gear shaper|shaped]] or [[broaching (metalworking)|broached]]).<ref>{{Citation |last=Weppelmann |first=E |last2=Brogni |first2=J |date=March 2014  |title=A breakthrough in power skiving |journal=Gear Production: A Supplement to [[Modern Machine Shop]] |pages=7\u201312 |url=http://gear.epubxp.com/i/262216 |accessdate=2014-03-11 |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Affolter-cnc-gear-hobbing-machine-gear-cutting-spur-gear.jpg|thumb|left]Spur Gears on Horizontal CNC Gear Hobbing Machine]]\n[[File:Affolter-cnc-gear-hobbing-machine-gear-cutting-spur-gear-brass-metal.jpg|thumb|left|Spur Gears on Horizontal CNC Gear Hobbing Machine]]\nHobbing uses a hobbing machine with two skew [[spindle (tool)|spindles]], one mounted with a blank workpiece and the other with the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, depending on the type of product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the [[lead angle]] of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear.

The city bird is the [[Korean magpie]], the city tree is the [[pine]], and the city flower is the [[royal azalea]].\n\nThe recorded history of Miryang begins in the [[Samhan]] period, when it was known as [[Mirimidongguk]].  Due to its strategic location near the [[Nakdong River]], Miryang played an important role from the [[Silla]] period forward.  It served as an important station on the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] during the later [[Joseon Dynasty]], and in the 20th century it became a station on the [[Gyeongbu Line]] railroad that connects [[Busan]] to [[Seoul]].  Miryang remains a key stop along that line, and is now the only city between Busan and [[Daegu]] served by [[KTX]] express trains.\n\nMiryang is known around Korea for the Miryang ''[[arirang]]'' and for the view from the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion, subject of numerous poems from the [[Joseon Dynasty]].  Other noted landmarks include [[Eoreumgol]] and the temple of [[Pyochungsa]].  Famous people from Miryang include 15th-century [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Kim Jong-jik]] and 16th-century warrior-monk [[Songun Yu Jeong]].  The city government works actively to maintain the memory of these figures, and of other local cultural features such as the tale of [[Arang (Korean folklore)|Arang]].\n\nMiryang gained national attention as the location of a [[Miryang gang rape|notorious gang rape incident in 2004]]. At least 41 male high school students raped a middle school girl, while assaulting her younger sister and cousin, over the course of 11 months. Despite this atrocity, many Miryang residents blamed the victims for \"seducing\" the boys, and even the Miryang police officers prevented a thorough investigation, telling the victims that \"Miryang is my hometown, and you ruined our city's reputation.\" All offenders were released with light punishments, which include in-class suspension and community service. None of the boys had to register as sex offenders. The rapists are presumed to be leading normal lives, while the victims have attempted to commit suicide numerous times.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Samhan]] , Miryang may have been part of the territory of [[Mirimidongguk]], one of the [[Byeonhan]] tribes mentioned in the ''[[San guo zhi]]''. Thereafter, it is believed to have been ruled by [[Geumgwan Gaya]] before being annexed by [[Silla]]. The ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records Mirimidongguk as being annexed by [[Jijeung of Silla]] in 505. In this period it was known as Chuhwa-gun ({{lang|ko|\u63a8\u706b\u90e1}}). Under the general reformation of names carried out by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] in the 8th century, the name was changed to \"Milseong-gun\" ({{lang|ko|\u5bc6\u57ce\u90e1}}).\n\nIn the [[Goryeo]] period (935\u20131392), Miryang was elevated to the status of a [[zhou (political division)|''ju'']], Mil-ju, by [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]]. In 1194, Miryang was the site of a massive battle between royal forces and a massive rebel army led by [[Kim Sami]] of Cheongdo and [[Hyosim]] of Ulsan. More than 7,000 rebels were slain.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 143.</ref> Under [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]] in the late 13th century, local residents led by [[Jo Cheon]] rose up against the government; in retaliation, Mil-ju was demoted to a tributary village of [[Gyeongju]] (then Gyerim). Later it became a ''[[hyeon]]''. Under [[Gongyang of Goryeo|King Gongyang]], it was raised to the status of a ''bu''.\n\nWith the dawn of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period (1392\u20131910), Miryang first became known by its modern name. Initially demoted from ''bu'' to ''gun'' (county) by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], it was then raised back to ''bu'' and its name changed from \"Milseong\" to \"Miryang.\" Under Taejo's son [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]], it was once again demoted to ''gun''. Later it became a ''dohobu'', or military protectorate, and in 1895 it became a ''gun'' once again; it was to carry this status until late in the 20th century.\n\nUnder [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Miryang was the site of various clashes between the [[Korean independence movement]] and the occupation forces. During the [[March First Movement]] of 1919, approximately 13,500 Miryang residents took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of Korean independence. This led to the \"[[Miryang massacre]],\" in which 150 Korean civilians were shot by occupation troops.<ref>\"\ubc00\uc591\ud559\uc0b4\uc0ac\uac74\" (Miryang haksal sageon, Miryang massacre incident) in Lee (1983), p. 456.</ref> In November 1920, independence fighter [[Choe Su-bong]] built and detonated two bombs at the Miryang police station, destroying the structure. He attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful; later he was put to death and his accomplices were imprisoned.<ref>\"\ubc00\uc591\uacbd\ucc30\uc11c \ud3ed\ud30c\uc0ac\uac74\" (Miryang gyeongchalseo pokpa sageon, Miryang police station bombing incident) in Lee (1983), p. 455.</ref>\n\nIn 1989 the city center was separated from the rest of Miryang and named \"Miryang-si\" (Miryang City). In 1995 the city center was reunited with the hinterland and the entire region became known as Miryang-si. Both of these were part of general reorganizations of South Korean local government.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Miryang from south.jpg|thumb|right|Miryang city centre as seen from across the Miryang River.]]\nMiryang's geography is heavily influenced by the two rivers which flow through it, the Miryang and [[Nakdong River|Nakdong]] Rivers.  All of Miryang lies within the Nakdong basin, and the Nakdong River itself runs along Miryang's southern border.  The city's topography generally slopes from the high peaks of the [[Yeongnam Alps]] in the northeast to the Nakdong valley in the southwest.  Much of the city is drained by the [[Miryang River]], which rises in western [[Ulsan]] and flows through the city center to join the Nakdong at [[Samnangjin]].  Portions are drained by other Nakdong tributaries, including the [[Naejincheon]].\n\nThe Miryang River valley south of the city center broadens into a fertile plain.  This area, including large portions of [[Samnangjin-eup]], [[Sangnam-myeon]], and [[Hanam-eup]], serves as a local breadbasket and is almost entirely devoted to rice-farming.  In Hanam-eup, it joins another plain running along the Nakdong.\n\nAs elsewhere in the [[Yeongnam]] region, the landscape is very lumpy, with many craggy hills and low mountains.  The highest mountain in Miryang is [[Gajisan (Gyeongsang-do)|Gajisan]] ({{cvt|1240|m|disp=comma}}), which stands on the northern border.  Other high peaks along the border include [[Hwaaksan]] and [[Cheonhwangsan (Gyeongsangnam-do/Ulsan)|Cheonhwangsan]] (also called Jaeyaksan).  These peaks are part of the Yeongnam Alps, a branch of the [[Taebaek Mountains]].\n\nFurther south, the mountains are lower but still quite frequent.  Notable peaks in this area include [[Maneosan]] in Samnangjin and [[Cheontaesan (Gyeongsangnam-do)|Cheontaesan]] on the border with [[Yangsan]].  Steep mountain valleys abound; these are often used for [[reservoir]]s that store water for [[irrigation]] or [[drinking water|drinking]] purposes.  Some of the larger reservoirs in Miryang include [[Miryang Lake]] and [[Antae Lake]].\n\n===Climate===\nLike most of the rest of [[South Korea]], Miryang enjoys a relatively mild temperate climate. The average windspeed is about {{cvt|1.4|m/s|km/h mph}}, the average temperature {{cvt|14.4|\u00b0C}}, and the annual rainfall in 2004 was {{cvt|1377.4|mm}}.<ref>[http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=18 \"5. \uae30\uc0c1\uac1c\ud669\" in Miryang City (2005).

On the other hand, it is relatively vulnerable to damage from [[tropical storm]]s encroaching from the south.\n\nThe Miryang and Nakdong valleys are subject to frequent floods during [[typhoon]]s, as well as more predictable flooding during the [[East Asian monsoon|monsoon season]].

In addition, [[agriculture in South Korea|agriculture]] continues to play an important role, particularly in outlying districts.  The Miryang River valley supports extensive rice farming operations, while livestock farming is more common on higher ground.\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Miryang station big.jpg|thumb|left|Miryang Station.]]\nMiryang is roughly equidistant from [[Daegu]] and [[Busan]], and is connected to both cities by road and rail.  By road, Miryang is served by two exits on the [[Daegu-Busan Expressway]], as well as numerous national and local highways.  By rail, it is served both by the [[Gyeongbu Line]] (Seoul-Busan) and the [[Gyeongjeon Line]] (to [[Masan]]); the northern terminus of the Gyeongjeon Line lies just north of [[Samnangjin]] near the meeting of the Nakdong and Miryang Rivers.  Miryang is the only city between Daegu and Busan currently served by the [[KTX]] express train.\n\nIn addition to [[Miryang Station]] in the city center, outlying regions are served by [[Samnangjin]] Station and [[Sangdong-myeon|Sangdong]] Station on the Gyeongbu Line, and [[Nakdonggang Station]] on the Gyeongjeon Line.  These outlying stations are served only by a small number of [[Mugunghwa-ho]] passenger trains.\n\nExcept for Nakdonggang Station, the stations in Miryang also serve freight trains.  The most active freight station is Sangdong, which sent out 74,762 tons of freight in 2004.<ref>Statistical Yearbook of Miryang, {{cite web |script-title=ko:5.  \ucca0\ub3c4\uc218\uc1a1|url=http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=141|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107202502/http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=141|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-01-07|accessdate=2006-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Miryang arirang statue.jpg|thumb|right|Statue commemorating the Miryang arirang.]]\n{{main|Korean culture}}\nMiryang is known as the home of the Miryang [[arirang]].  This is sometimes considered to be close to the original version of the arirang, which may have drawn its name from the Miryang area folktale of [[Arang (Korean folklore)|Arang]].  The Miryang Arirang Festival is held each May to commemorate and keep alive this tradition and other aspects of local heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=68173 |script-title=ko:\ubc00\uc591\uc544\ub9ac\ub791\ub300\ucd95\uc81c|work=Naver Encyclopedia|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>\n\nOther preserved aspects of Korean traditional culture are the [[Baekjung]] performances.\n\nThe people of Miryang speak a version of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] of [[Korean language|Korean]].  In studies of [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialectology]], Miryang dialect has been contrasted with the [[Changwon]] dialect in terms of the use of pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/kyear/2004/2004_05.html |script-title=ko:\uc74c\uc131\ud559/\uc74c\uc6b4\ub860|work=\uc0c8\uad6d\uc5b4\uc0dd\ud65c (New Korean Life)|year=2004|author=Shin, Ji-yeong (\uc2e0\uc9c0\uc601)}}</ref>\n\nMiryang is also famous for filming the movie Miryang.<ref>{{Citation|title=Secret Sunshine|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817225/|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe history of education in Miryang can be traced back to the [[Goryeo]] period, when a ''[[hyanggyo]]'', a government-run village school, was constructed in the town center (modern-day [[Gyo-dong (Miryang)|Gyo-dong]]).  This school, famed for its size,<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\ubc00\uc591\ud5a5\uad50|work=Naver Encyclopedia|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=738085|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref> continued in operation through the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period, although it was gradually supplanted by numerous local [[seodang]] and [[seowon]]. All of these institutions concentrated on training young men for the [[gwageo|royal civil service examinations]].  This system lasted until the abolition of the examinations in the [[Gabo Reforms]] of 1894.\n\nToday in Miryang, as elsewhere in South Korea, compulsory public education is provided for all students through middle school, and almost all students complete high school as well.  Education within the city is overseen by the Miryang Office of Education, which is administered directly by the Gyeongsangnam-do provincial Office of Education.  This is in turn accountable to the national [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]], which sets the national curriculum for all schools.\n\nThere are 23 elementary schools, 14 middle schools, and 8 high schools in Miryang.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\ud559\uad50/\uc18c\uc18d\uae30\uad00 \ud604\ud669 (Hakgyo/sosok-gigwan hyeonhwang, Statistics on school schools and affiliated institutions)|url=http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|work=Miryang Office of Education website|accessdate=2006-09-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816123557/http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|archivedate=2005-08-16}}</ref>  Supplementary private education is offered through [[hagwon]]s, which are strongly concentrated in the city center, with some in outlying towns.\n\n[[File:PNU Miryang main.jpg|thumb|left|Main administration building at the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].]]\nThere is only one institution of higher education in Miryang.  This is the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].  The Miryang campus primarily serves commuter students, drawn from Miryang as well as neighboring cities including [[Changwon]], [[Gimhae]], [[Masan]], and [[Busan]].  It is located in northern [[Samnangjin-eup]], near the city center.  A branch campus, formerly the main campus, is located near downtown Miryang.  These two campuses were merged into Pusan National University in 2006.  Previously, they made up a separate university called [[Miryang National University]], which traced its roots back to 1923.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Yeongnamru Miryang Gyeongsangnamdo.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]]]]\nMiryang has been known for centuries for its scenery of mountains and valleys; the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion overlooking the Miryang River appears in numerous Joseon Dynasty writings. The northeastern corner of the city occupies a portion of the [[Yeongnam Alps]]; part of this region is included in [[Gajisan (Ulsan/Gyeongsang)|Gajisan]] Provincial Park.  Noted natural landmarks include the \"ice valley\" of [[Eoreumgol]], also located in the northeast.\n\nA number of noted historic landmarks are found in Miryang.  These include various [[seowon]], or Confucian academies, including the [[Yerim Seowon]] dedicated to [[Kim Jong-jik]] and the [[Pyochung Seowon]], which is the only seowon constructed inside a Buddhist temple ([[Pyochungsa]]).  The Yeongnamnu pavilion and nearby buildings date from the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] and [[Goryeo]] periods.  [[National treasures of South Korea|South Korean National Treasure]] No. 75 is located at Pyochungsa.\n\nYangyangji, which was built during the [[Silla Dynasty]], was a water reservoir for the rice paddies, but it lost its original function due to a huge additional reservoir. But instead of putting water on the rice fields, the park attracts many tourists with picturesque scenery.<ref>{{Cite

The city bird is the [[Korean magpie]], the city tree is the [[pine]], and the city flower is the [[royal azalea]].\n\nThe recorded history of Miryang begins in the [[Samhan]] period, when it was known as [[Mirimidongguk]].  Due to its strategic location near the [[Nakdong River]], Miryang played an important role from the [[Silla]] period forward.  It served as an important station on the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] during the later [[Joseon Dynasty]], and in the 20th century it became a station on the [[Gyeongbu Line]] railroad that connects [[Busan]] to [[Seoul]].  Miryang remains a key stop along that line, and is now the only city between Busan and [[Daegu]] served by [[KTX]] express trains.\n\nMiryang is known around Korea for the Miryang ''[[arirang]]'' and for the view from the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion, subject of numerous poems from the [[Joseon Dynasty]].  Other noted landmarks include [[Eoreumgol]] and the temple of [[Pyochungsa]].  Famous people from Miryang include 15th-century [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Kim Jong-jik]] and 16th-century warrior-monk [[Songun Yu Jeong]].  The city government works actively to maintain the memory of these figures, and of other local cultural features such as the tale of [[Arang (Korean folklore)|Arang]].\n\nMiryang gained national attention as the location of a [[Miryang gang rape|notorious gang rape incident in 2004]]. At least 41 male high school students raped a middle school girl, while assaulting her younger sister and cousin, over the course of 11 months. Despite this atrocity, many Miryang residents blamed the victims for \"seducing\" the boys, and even the Miryang police officers prevented a thorough investigation, telling the victims that \"Miryang is my hometown, and you ruined our city's reputation.\" All offenders were released with light punishments, which include in-class suspension and community service. None of the boys had to register as sex offenders. The rapists are presumed to be leading normal lives, while the victims have attempted to commit suicide numerous times.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Samhan]] , Miryang may have been part of the territory of [[Mirimidongguk]], one of the [[Byeonhan]] tribes mentioned in the ''[[San guo zhi]]''. Thereafter, it is believed to have been ruled by [[Geumgwan Gaya]] before being annexed by [[Silla]]. The ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records Mirimidongguk as being annexed by [[Jijeung of Silla]] in 505. In this period it was known as Chuhwa-gun ({{lang|ko|\u63a8\u706b\u90e1}}). Under the general reformation of names carried out by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] in the 8th century, the name was changed to \"Milseong-gun\" ({{lang|ko|\u5bc6\u57ce\u90e1}}).\n\nIn the [[Goryeo]] period (935\u20131392), Miryang was elevated to the status of a [[zhou (political division)|''ju'']], Mil-ju, by [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]]. In 1194, Miryang was the site of a massive battle between royal forces and a massive rebel army led by [[Kim Sami]] of Cheongdo and [[Hyosim]] of Ulsan. More than 7,000 rebels were slain.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 143.</ref> Under [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]] in the late 13th century, local residents led by [[Jo Cheon]] rose up against the government; in retaliation, Mil-ju was demoted to a tributary village of [[Gyeongju]] (then Gyerim). Later it became a ''[[hyeon]]''. Under [[Gongyang of Goryeo|King Gongyang]], it was raised to the status of a ''bu''.\n\nWith the dawn of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period (1392\u20131910), Miryang first became known by its modern name. Initially demoted from ''bu'' to ''gun'' (county) by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], it was then raised back to ''bu'' and its name changed from \"Milseong\" to \"Miryang.\" Under Taejo's son [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]], it was once again demoted to ''gun''. Later it became a ''dohobu'', or military protectorate, and in 1895 it became a ''gun'' once again; it was to carry this status until late in the 20th century.\n\nUnder [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Miryang was the site of various clashes between the [[Korean independence movement]] and the occupation forces. During the [[March First Movement]] of 1919, approximately 13,500 Miryang residents took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of Korean independence. This led to the \"[[Miryang massacre]],\" in which 150 Korean civilians were shot by occupation troops.<ref>\"\ubc00\uc591\ud559\uc0b4\uc0ac\uac74\" (Miryang haksal sageon, Miryang massacre incident) in Lee (1983), p. 456.</ref> In November 1920, independence fighter [[Choe Su-bong]] built and detonated two bombs at the Miryang police station, destroying the structure. He attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful; later he was put to death and his accomplices were imprisoned.<ref>\"\ubc00\uc591\uacbd\ucc30\uc11c \ud3ed\ud30c\uc0ac\uac74\" (Miryang gyeongchalseo pokpa sageon, Miryang police station bombing incident) in Lee (1983), p. 455.</ref>\n\nIn 1989 the city center was separated from the rest of Miryang and named \"Miryang-si\" (Miryang City). In 1995 the city center was reunited with the hinterland and the entire region became known as Miryang-si. Both of these were part of general reorganizations of South Korean local government.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Miryang from south.jpg|thumb|right|Miryang city centre as seen from across the Miryang River.]]\nMiryang's geography is heavily influenced by the two rivers which flow through it, the Miryang and [[Nakdong River|Nakdong]] Rivers.  All of Miryang lies within the Nakdong basin, and the Nakdong River itself runs along Miryang's southern border.  The city's topography generally slopes from the high peaks of the [[Yeongnam Alps]] in the northeast to the Nakdong valley in the southwest.  Much of the city is drained by the [[Miryang River]], which rises in western [[Ulsan]] and flows through the city center to join the Nakdong at [[Samnangjin]].  Portions are drained by other Nakdong tributaries, including the [[Naejincheon]].\n\nThe Miryang River valley south of the city center broadens into a fertile plain.  This area, including large portions of [[Samnangjin-eup]], [[Sangnam-myeon]], and [[Hanam-eup]], serves as a local breadbasket and is almost entirely devoted to rice-farming.  In Hanam-eup, it joins another plain running along the Nakdong.\n\nAs elsewhere in the [[Yeongnam]] region, the landscape is very lumpy, with many craggy hills and low mountains.  The highest mountain in Miryang is [[Gajisan (Gyeongsang-do)|Gajisan]] ({{cvt|1240|m|disp=comma}}), which stands on the northern border.  Other high peaks along the border include [[Hwaaksan]] and [[Cheonhwangsan (Gyeongsangnam-do/Ulsan)|Cheonhwangsan]] (also called Jaeyaksan).  These peaks are part of the Yeongnam Alps, a branch of the [[Taebaek Mountains]].\n\nFurther south, the mountains are lower but still quite frequent.  Notable peaks in this area include [[Maneosan]] in Samnangjin and [[Cheontaesan (Gyeongsangnam-do)|Cheontaesan]] on the border with [[Yangsan]].  Steep mountain valleys abound; these are often used for [[reservoir]]s that store water for [[irrigation]] or [[drinking water|drinking]] purposes.  Some of the larger reservoirs in Miryang include [[Miryang Lake]] and [[Antae Lake]].\n\n===Climate===\nLike most of the rest of [[South Korea]], Miryang enjoys a relatively mild temperate climate. The average windspeed is about {{cvt|1.4|m/s|km/h mph}}, the average temperature {{cvt|14.4|\u00b0C}}, and the annual rainfall in 2004 was {{cvt|1377.4|mm}}.<ref>[http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=18 \"5. \uae30\uc0c1\uac1c\ud669\" in Miryang City (2005).

On the other hand, it is relatively vulnerable to damage from [[tropical storm]]s encroaching from the south.\n\nThe Miryang and Nakdong valleys are subject to frequent floods during [[typhoon]]s, as well as more predictable flooding during the [[East Asian monsoon|monsoon season]].  Other natural disasters are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miryang.go.kr/kor/introduction/04_02_04.html |script-title=ko:\uc790\uc5f0 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd\uc7ac\ud574  (Jayeon mit hwan-gyeong jaehae, Natural and environmental disasters) |work=Miryang City website |accessdate=2006-09-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813041811/http://www.miryang.go.kr/kor/introduction/04_02_04.html |archivedate=August 13, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Miryang (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C =  7.0\n|Feb high C =  9.4\n|Mar high C = 14.1\n|Apr high C = 20.5\n|May high C = 24.8\n|Jun high C = 27.8\n|Jul high C = 29.9\n|Aug high C = 31.0\n|Sep high C = 27.1\n|Oct high C = 22.5\n|Nov high C = 15.6\n|Dec high C =  9.4\n|year high C= 19.9\n|Jan mean C =  0.0\n|Feb mean C =  2.4\n|Mar mean C =  7.2\n|Apr mean C = 13.1\n|May mean C = 17.8\n|Jun mean C = 21.9\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.8\n|Sep mean C = 21.1\n|Oct mean C = 14.8\n|Nov mean C =  8.0\n|Dec mean C =  1.9\n|year mean C= 13.3\n|Jan low C = \u22125.8\n|Feb low C = \u22123.9\n|Mar low C =  0.5\n|Apr low C =  5.7\n|May low C = 11.2\n|Jun low C = 16.7\n|Jul low C = 21.4\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 16.2\n|Oct low C =  8.4\n|Nov low C =  1.7\n|Dec low C = -4.0\n|year low C=  7.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm =  22.3\n|Feb precipitation mm =  34.0\n|Mar precipitation mm =  54.4\n|Apr precipitation mm =  86.3\n|May precipitation mm = 108.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 186.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 269.5\n|Aug precipitation mm = 237.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 136.1\n|Oct precipitation mm =  39.5\n|Nov precipitation mm =  38.2\n|Dec precipitation mm =  16.4\n|year precipitation mm=1229.4\n|Jan humidity = 60.8\n|Feb humidity = 59.2\n|Mar humidity = 60.1\n|Apr humidity = 61.0\n|May humidity = 66.0\n|Jun humidity = 70.8\n|Jul humidity = 78.4\n|Aug humidity = 77.2\n|Sep humidity = 75.2\n|Oct humidity = 71.3\n|Nov humidity = 68.2\n|Dec humidity = 64.5\n|year humidity= 67.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  3.8\n|Feb precipitation days =  4.9\n|Mar precipitation days =  7.0\n|Apr precipitation days =  7.9\n|May precipitation days =  8.4\n|Jun precipitation days =  9.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 13.3\n|Aug precipitation days = 12.0\n|Sep precipitation days =  8.7\n|Oct precipitation days =  4.2\n|Nov precipitation days =  4.8\n|Dec precipitation days =  3.3\n|Jan sun = 191.7\n|Feb sun = 183.2\n|Mar sun = 205.1\n|Apr sun = 219.8\n|May sun = 228.8\n|Jun sun = 185.0\n|Jul sun = 160.5\n|Aug sun = 184.6\n|Sep sun = 166.4\n|Oct sun = 208.2\n|Nov sun = 181.4\n|Dec sun = 189.1\n|year sun=2302.3\n|source = Korea Meteorological Administration<ref name= KMA>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.kma.go.kr/weather/climate/average_30years.jsp?yy_st=2011&stn=288&norm=M&x=16&y=11&obs=0&mm=5&dd=4\n|publisher=Korea Meteorological Administration\n|accessdate=2011-05-04\n|script-title=ko:\ud3c9\ub144\uac12\uc790\ub8cc(1981\u20132010) \ubc00\uc591(288)}}</ref>\n|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nMiryang is divided into 16 primary divisions, of which 2 are ''eup'' (large villages), 5 are ''dong'' (city precincts), and 9 are ''myeon'' (rural areas).

By road, Miryang is served by two exits on the [[Daegu-Busan Expressway]], as well as numerous national and local highways.  By rail, it is served both by the [[Gyeongbu Line]] (Seoul-Busan) and the [[Gyeongjeon Line]] (to [[Masan]]); the northern terminus of the Gyeongjeon Line lies just north of [[Samnangjin]] near the meeting of the Nakdong and Miryang Rivers.  Miryang is the only city between Daegu and Busan currently served by the [[KTX]] express train.\n\nIn addition to [[Miryang Station]] in the city center, outlying regions are served by [[Samnangjin]] Station and [[Sangdong-myeon|Sangdong]] Station on the Gyeongbu Line, and [[Nakdonggang Station]] on the Gyeongjeon Line.  These outlying stations are served only by a small number of [[Mugunghwa-ho]] passenger trains.\n\nExcept for Nakdonggang Station, the stations in Miryang also serve freight trains.

This system lasted until the abolition of the examinations in the [[Gabo Reforms]] of 1894.\n\nToday in Miryang, as elsewhere in South Korea, compulsory public education is provided for all students through middle school, and almost all students complete high school as well.  Education within the city is overseen by the Miryang Office of Education, which is administered directly by the Gyeongsangnam-do provincial Office of Education.  This is in turn accountable to the national [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]], which sets the national curriculum for all schools.\n\nThere are 23 elementary schools, 14 middle schools, and 8 high schools in Miryang.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\ud559\uad50/\uc18c\uc18d\uae30\uad00 \ud604\ud669 (Hakgyo/sosok-gigwan hyeonhwang, Statistics on school schools and affiliated institutions)|url=http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|work=Miryang Office of Education website|accessdate=2006-09-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816123557/http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|archivedate=2005-08-16}}</ref>  Supplementary private education is offered through [[hagwon]]s, which are strongly concentrated in the city center, with some in outlying towns.\n\n[[File:PNU Miryang main.jpg|thumb|left|Main administration building at the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].]]\nThere is only one institution of higher education in Miryang.  This is the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].  The Miryang campus primarily serves commuter students, drawn from Miryang as well as neighboring cities including [[Changwon]], [[Gimhae]], [[Masan]], and [[Busan]].  It is located in northern [[Samnangjin-eup]], near the city center.  A branch campus, formerly the main campus, is located near downtown Miryang.  These two campuses were merged into Pusan National University in 2006.  Previously, they made up a separate university called [[Miryang National University]], which traced its roots back to 1923.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Yeongnamru Miryang Gyeongsangnamdo.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]]]]\nMiryang has been known for centuries for its scenery of mountains and valleys; the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion overlooking the Miryang River appears in numerous Joseon Dynasty writings. The northeastern corner of the city occupies a portion of the [[Yeongnam Alps]]; part of this region is included in [[Gajisan (Ulsan/Gyeongsang)|Gajisan]] Provincial Park.  Noted natural landmarks include the \"ice valley\" of [[Eoreumgol]], also located in the northeast.\n\nA number of noted historic landmarks are found in Miryang.  These include various [[seowon]], or Confucian academies, including the [[Yerim Seowon]] dedicated to [[Kim Jong-jik]] and the [[Pyochung Seowon]], which is the only seowon constructed inside a Buddhist temple ([[Pyochungsa]]).  The Yeongnamnu pavilion and nearby buildings date from the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] and [[Goryeo]] periods.  [[National treasures of South Korea|South Korean National Treasure]] No. 75 is located at Pyochungsa.\n\nYangyangji, which was built during the [[Silla Dynasty]], was a water reservoir for the rice paddies, but it lost its original function due to a huge additional reservoir. But instead of putting water on the rice fields, the park attracts many tourists with picturesque scenery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://korean.visitkorea.or.kr/kor/bz15/where/where_tour.jsp?cid=2545984&gotoPage= |script-title=ko:\uc591\uc591\uc9c0(\uc704\uc591\ubabb)|website=korean.visitkorea.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nMiryang  is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Yasugi, Shimane|Yasugi]], [[Shimane Prefecture|Shimane]], Japan (1990) \n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} [[\u014cmihachiman, Shiga|\u014cmihachiman]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], Japan (1994) \n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Benxi]], [[Liaoning]], China (1998) \n* {{flagdeco|ROK}} [[Namwon]], [[North Jeolla Province|North Jeolla]], South Korea (1999) \n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Ulan Hot]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China (1999) \n* {{flagdeco|US}} [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]], [[New Jersey]], United States (2004) \n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Handan]], [[Hebei]], China (2004)\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Setouchi, Okayama|Setouchi]], [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama]], Japan (2006)\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Nanping]], [[Fujian]], China (2016)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Secret Sunshine]]\n* [[List of cities in South Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |script-title=ko:\uc0c8\u570b\u53f2\u4e8b\u5178 (Sae guksa sajeon, New encyclopedia of Korean history)|author=Lee Hong-jik (\uc774\ud64d\uc9c1)|location=Seoul|year=1983|publisher=Kyohaksa}}\n*{{cite web |script-title=ko:\ubc00\uc591\uc2dc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc5f0\ubcf4 (Miryang-si tonggye yeonbo, Statistical yearbook of Miryang City)|author=Miryang City|url=http://cal.miryang.go.kr/|year=2005|accessdate=2006-09-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522104855/http://cal.miryang.go.kr/|archivedate=2006-05-22}}\n*{{cite book |script-title=ko:\ub0a8\uba85\ud559\ud30c\uc640 \uc601\ub0a8\uc6b0\ub3c4\uc758 \uc0ac\ub9bc (Nammyeonghakpa-wa Yeongnamudo-ui sarim, The Nammyeong school and the Sarim of right-hand Yeongnam Province)|author=Pak Byeong-ryeon (\ubc15\ubcd1\ub828) ed.|publisher=Yemoon Seowon|location=Seoul|year=2004|isbn=978-89-7646-190-2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://eng.miryang.go.kr/main/ City government website]\n\n{{South Gyeongsang}}\n{{Metropolitan cities of South Korea}}\n\n{{coord|35|30|N|128|45|E|region:KR-48_type:city|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Miryang| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in South Gyeongsang Province]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miryang"}

Looking at a wall clock she notices the bus is late. She asks the ticket agent when the bus will arrive, and he gruffly complains that this is her third time asking. Millicent denies this. While speaking with him, she notices a bag just like hers on the floor behind the desk. She mentions this and the agent responds that it is her bag. She does not believe this until she notices her bag is not beside the bench anymore. She washes her hands in the restroom and the cleaning lady there insists this is her second time there. Again, Millicent denies this. Upon leaving the restroom, she glances in the mirror and sees, in addition to her reflection, an exact copy of herself sitting on the bench outside.\n\nShe then meets a young man from [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] named Paul Grinstead, who is waiting for the same bus. Paul encourages Millicent to tell him what obviously is bothering her, so she explains about encountering her double. Attempting to calm her, Paul says it is either a joke or a misunderstanding caused by a look-alike. When the bus arrives and the two of them prepare to board, Millicent happens to look up at the windows and sees the copy of herself, already seated on the bus. In shock, she runs back into the depot and faints.\n\nMillicent lies unconscious on a bench inside the depot while Paul and the cleaning lady attend to her. Paul decides to wait for the 7:00 a.m. bus. While they wait, Millicent, now coming to, insists the strange events are caused by an evil double from a parallel world - a nearby, yet distant alternative plane of existence that comes into convergence with this world as a result of powerful forces, or unnatural, unknown events. When these events occur, the impostors enter this realm. Millicent's [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] can survive in this world only by eliminating and replacing her. Paul says the explanation is \"a little metaphysical\" for him, and believes that Millicent's sanity is beginning to unravel. Paul tells Millicent he will call a friend in [[Tully (town), New York|Tully]] who has a car and may be able to drive them to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. Instead, he calls the police.\n\nAfter Millicent is taken away by two policemen, Paul begins to settle himself. After drinking from a water fountain, Paul notices that his valise is missing. Looking up towards the doors, Paul notices another man running out the door of the bus depot. Pursuing this individual down the street, Paul discovers that he is chasing his own copy, whose face shows excited delight. His copy disappears as Paul calls out \"Where are you?\" while looking around in confusion and shock.\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|Obscure and metaphysical explanation to cover a phenomenon.

{"title_page": "Mint mark", "text_new": "A '''mint mark''' is a letter, symbol or an inscription on a [[coin]] indicating the [[mint (coin)|mint]] where the coin was produced.\n\n==History==\nMint marks were first developed to locate a problem. If a coin was underweight, or overweight, the mint mark would immediately tell where the coin was minted, and the problem could be located and fixed. Another problem which could occur would be a dishonest mint official [[debasement|debasing]] the coin, or putting less [[precious metal]] in the coin than specified. The first mint marks, called \"Magistrate Marks\" were developed by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and named the [[Magistrate]] in charge of producing that coin. Debasing a coin, or otherwise tampering with it, was a very serious crime, often punishable by death in many civilizations. For example, in 1649, the directors of the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial American Mint at [[Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], in what is today [[Bolivia]], were condemned to death for seriously debasing the coinage. The initials of the [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] as well as the mint mark were immediate identifiers when the coins were inspected.\n\nIn some cases the symbols found in the field of ancient Greek coins indicated mints, not magistrates.  Mints in territories conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] struck coins with the types he used in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] but marked with a local symbol.<ref>Greek Coins and Their Values, H. A. Seaby, Kings of Macedon coin 539</ref> For example, Rhodes struck coins with Alexander\u2019s types marked with a rose, a local symbol previously used on its own coins.<ref>Historia Numorum, Barcay Head, introduction page lix</ref>\n\nA reform of [[Diocletian]] made mint marks a regular feature of ancient Roman coinage.  These mint marks were placed at the bottom of the reverse of the coin and contained three parts.   The first part indicates that this was a coin with either SM for Sacra Moneta, M for Moneta, or P for Pecurnia.  The second part was an abbreviation of the name of the mint such as ROM for Rome or LON for London.  The final part indicated the workshop within the mint.<ref>Roman Coins and Their Values, David Sear page 47</ref>  The reform of [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]], which is the traditional dividing point between the  coinage of the Roman and the Later Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) empires, replaced the mint marks on gold coins by the inscription CONOB, meaning the pure standard of Constantinople, which was used by a variety of mints.  Mint marks continued on copper coinage until the second half of the seventh century, however.<ref>Byzantine Coins, P. D. Whiting, page 60</ref>\n\n[[Image:PrivyMark.jpg|thumb|Mint mark and privy marks on [[Cochinchina Piastre|French Cochinchina 20 Cents 1879]], [[Paris Mint]] ]]\nMint names began to appear on French coins under Pepin and became mandatory under [[Charlemagne]].<ref>Coins in History, John Porteous, page 54</ref>  In 1389, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] adopted a system called Secret Points.

This was one of the few royal practices continued by the Republic of France.<ref>Coins in History, John Porteous, page 164</ref>   The mint letters continued until 1898 (briefly revived in 1914 and from 1942-58) and the mint-masters marks, supplemented by the mark of the Chief Engraver, are still used.<ref> Standard Catalog of World Coins by Krause Publications</ref>\n\nSome Medieval English coins used mint names .<ref>Coins in History, John Porteous, page 68</ref>  When [[William III of England|William III]] retired hammered coinage, branch mints which helped strike machine made coins to replace it put their initials below his bust.<ref>Coins in History, John Porteous, page 214</ref>   The Royal Mint established branches to coin [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] near the sources of gold.  These issues show the initials of Sydney, Melbourne, Victoria, and Perth Australia as well as Canada, South Africa, and India.<ref>Historic Gold Coins of the World, Burton Hobson, pages 129 and 132</ref>  The privately owned [[Soho Mint]] obtained a contract to strike royal copper coins with steam presses and put its name on these coins and on coins it minted for other countries.  When it closed, Ralph Heaton acquired its equipment, founded the [[Birmingham Mint]], and put his H mint mark on coins of Canada, among others.\n\n[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Spanish Milled Dollar with Mexico City Mint Mark.]]\nThe Spanish Empire introduced mint marks to the New World when they authorized Mexico City to open a mint on 11 May 1535.  The Spanish Empire established mints throughout its American territories, each with their own mint mark.  After its revolution, Mexico continued to use its colonial Mo monogram mint mark shown on either side of the date in the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish Milled Dollar]].  The United States of America established mints in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dahlonega, Georgia in 1838 after the  [[Georgia Gold Rush]] and put its first mint marks on the gold coins struck there.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Coins, R. S. Yeoman</ref>  Like other countries, the United States has since placed mint marks not only on its own coins but also those of its territories, such as the Philippines, and other countries for which it has contracts to strike coins, such as Fiji.\n\n==Mint marks in numismatics==\nIn the 19th century, [[numismatists]] (coin collectors) did not generally collect coins according to mint mark; rather, they attempted to obtain date sets of coins. A turnaround began after 1893, when [[A. G. Heaton]]'s \"A Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints\" was published. Heaton cited example after example of mint-marked coins that were much scarcer than [[Philadelphia]] products and that should bring high premiums. When the [[United States]] abandoned [[silver]] coinage in 1964, mint marks were removed from the new [[copper-nickel]] coins in the belief that it would reduce the removal of coins from circulation by collectors. The silver coins quickly disappeared from circulation, and it was feared that if collectors saved too many of the new coins, there would be a serious shortage of coinage. Mint marks were returned to United States coins in 1968.\n\n==United States Mint Marks==\nThe current mint marks on [[United States coinage]]  are P, D, S, and W for the 4 currently operating US Mints.  The letter P is used for the [[Philadelphia Mint]], D for the [[Denver Mint]], S for the [[San Francisco Mint]], and W for the [[West Point Mint]].  Over time there have been 9 official United States Mints.  The first US Mint was in Philadelphia which began coin production with large cents and the half cents of pure copper in early 1793. Other US Mints, prior to the twentieth century, were considered \"branch mints\".  United States mint marks were  originally used to distinguish coins not made in Philadelphia.  The 8 mint marks used to distinguish coins not minted in Philadelphia (in the chronological order of their first coinage) are: D for the [[Dahlonega Mint]] (production of coins started on February 12, 1838), C for the [[Charlotte Mint]] (March 27, 1838), O for the [[New Orleans Mint]] (May 8, 1838), S for the [[San Francisco Mint]] (April 3, 1854), CC for the [[Carson City Mint]] (February 11, 1870), D again (Dahlonega had closed in 1861 never to reopen) now for the [[Denver Mint]] (March 12, 1906),  M for [[Manila Mint]] (July 15, 1920) (where an official US Mint began with the coinage of a one centavo coin on July 15, 1920) and lastly a W for the [[West Point Mint]]  The West Point Mint began coin production on July 29, 1974 to ease the shortage of quarters and other minor coinage and bore no mint mark. Thus West Point coins could not be distinguished from those made at the Philadelphia Mint. The West Point mint mark, \"W\", was first used on the $10 gold coins commemorating the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles.  Most Philadelphia Mint coins from earlier than 1980 were unmarked with the notable exception being wartime nickels (1942-1945).  The P mint mark was first used on the Susan B. Anthony Dollars starting 1979.  From 1980 until 2017, the [[Lincoln cent]] was the only coin that did not always have a mint mark, using a \"D\" when struck in Denver but lacking a \"P\" when ostensibly struck at the Philadelphia mint. This practice allowed the additional minting of coins at the San Francisco mint (\"S\") and West Point mint (\"W\") without the use of their respective mint marks to address circulating coinage needs without the concern of creating scarce varieties that would be plucked from circulation by collectors.  In the single year of 2017 the Philadelphia \"P\" was added to the Lincoln cent to celebrate 225 years of Philadelphia Mint service.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's really true: Cents struck at Philadelphia Mint in 2017 bear P Mint mark|url=http://www.coinworld.com/news/us-coins/2017/01/p-mint-mark-added-to-lincoln-cent-for-first-time.all.html|publisher=Coin World|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref> Generally 21st century coins with an \"S\" or \"W\" coins do not circulate, being mostly produced as [[bullion]], [[commemorative coin|commemorative]], [[proof coinage]] or other \"collector coinage\" sold by the US Mint to either authorized bullion wholesalers or directly to collectors.\n\nAlthough the US and several other countries use the initial letter of the city for its mint marks, this practice is not universal.  For instance, Germany used A for Berlin, D for Munich, E for Muldenhutten, F for Stuttgart, G for Karlsruhe and J for Hamburg.  When Spain adopted decimal coinage in 1848, it used stars with different numbers of points as mint marks. Madrid used six pointed stars, Barcelona used eight pointed stars, and so on.  After the revolution of 1868, small dates were placed in these stars.<ref>Standard Catalog of World Coins, C. Krause and C Michler, Spain</ref>  The small dates indicated the year the coin was struck, as opposed to the large date on the coin which was the year it was authorized.<ref>The Coin Atlas, Crib, Cook, and Carradice, p. 58</ref>\n\nMany mints of the world commonly use a [[Privy mark]], which is a symbol unique to each mint. The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] commonly uses a [[maple leaf]] privy mark.   Segovia, Spain used an aqueduct, a local landmark, before it switched over to the star system in 1868.

If a coin was underweight, or overweight, the mint mark would immediately tell where the coin was minted, and the problem could be located and fixed. Another problem which could occur would be a dishonest mint official [[debasement|debasing]] the coin, or putting less [[precious metal]] in the coin than specified. The first mint marks, called \"Magistrate Marks\" were developed by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and named the [[Magistrate]] in charge of producing that coin. Debasing a coin, or otherwise tampering with it, was a very serious crime, often punishable by death in many civilizations. For example, in 1649, the directors of the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial American Mint at [[Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], in what is today [[Bolivia]], were condemned to death for seriously debasing the coinage. The initials of the [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] as well as the mint mark were immediate identifiers when the coins were inspected.\n\nIn some cases the symbols found in the field of ancient Greek coins indicated mints, not magistrates.  Mints in territories conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] struck coins with the types he used in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] but marked with a local symbol.<ref>Greek Coins and Their Values, H. A. Seaby, Kings of Macedon coin 539</ref> For example, Rhodes struck coins with Alexander\u2019s types marked with a rose, a local symbol previously used on its own coins.<ref>Historia Numorum, Barcay Head, introduction page lix</ref>\n\nA reform of [[Diocletian]] made mint marks a regular feature of ancient Roman coinage.  These mint marks were placed at the bottom of the reverse of the coin and contained three parts.   The first part indicates that this was a coin with either SM for Sacra Moneta, M for Moneta, or P for Pecurnia.  The second part was an abbreviation of the name of the mint such as ROM for Rome or LON for London.  The final part indicated the workshop within the mint.<ref>Roman Coins and Their Values, David Sear page 47</ref>  The reform of [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]], which is the traditional dividing point between the  coinage of the Roman and the Later Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) empires, replaced the mint marks on gold coins by the inscription CONOB, meaning the pure standard of Constantinople, which was used by a variety of mints.  Mint marks continued on copper coinage until the second half of the seventh century, however.<ref>Byzantine Coins, P. D. Whiting, page 60</ref>\n\n[[Image:PrivyMark.jpg|thumb|Mint mark and privy marks on [[Cochinchina Piastre|French Cochinchina 20 Cents 1879]], [[Paris Mint]] ]]\nMint names began to appear on French coins under Pepin and became mandatory under [[Charlemagne]].<ref>Coins in History, John Porteous, page 54</ref>  In 1389, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] adopted a system called Secret Points.

When it closed, Ralph Heaton acquired its equipment, founded the [[Birmingham Mint]], and put his H mint mark on coins of Canada, among others.\n\n[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Spanish Milled Dollar with Mexico City Mint Mark.]]\nThe Spanish Empire introduced mint marks to the New World when they authorized Mexico City to open a mint on 11 May 1535.  The Spanish Empire established mints throughout its American territories, each with their own mint mark.  After its revolution, Mexico continued to use its colonial Mo monogram mint mark shown on either side of the date in the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish Milled Dollar]].  The United States of America established mints in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dahlonega, Georgia in 1838 after the  [[Georgia Gold Rush]] and put its first mint marks on the gold coins struck there.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Coins, R. S. Yeoman</ref>  Like other countries, the United States has since placed mint marks not only on its own coins but also those of its territories, such as the Philippines, and other countries for which it has contracts to strike coins, such as Fiji.\n\n==Mint marks in numismatics==\nIn the 19th century, [[numismatists]] (coin collectors) did not generally collect coins according to mint mark; rather, they attempted to obtain date sets of coins. A turnaround began after 1893, when [[A. G. Heaton]]'s \"A Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints\" was published. Heaton cited example after example of mint-marked coins that were much scarcer than [[Philadelphia]] products and that should bring high premiums. When the [[United States]] abandoned [[silver]] coinage in 1964, mint marks were removed from the new [[copper-nickel]] coins in the belief that it would reduce the removal of coins from circulation by collectors. The silver coins quickly disappeared from circulation, and it was feared that if collectors saved too many of the new coins, there would be a serious shortage of coinage. Mint marks were returned to United States coins in 1968.\n\n==United States Mint Marks==\nThe current mint marks on [[United States coinage]]  are P, D, S, and W for the 4 currently operating US Mints.  The letter P is used for the [[Philadelphia Mint]], D for the [[Denver Mint]], S for the [[San Francisco Mint]], and W for the [[West Point Mint]].  Over time there have been 9 official United States Mints.  The first US Mint was in Philadelphia which began coin production with large cents and the half cents of pure copper in early 1793. Other US Mints, prior to the twentieth century, were considered \"branch mints\".  United States mint marks were  originally used to distinguish coins not made in Philadelphia.  The 8 mint marks used to distinguish coins not minted in Philadelphia (in the chronological order of their first coinage) are: D for the [[Dahlonega Mint]] (production of coins started on February 12, 1838), C for the [[Charlotte Mint]] (March 27, 1838), O for the [[New Orleans Mint]] (May 8, 1838), S for the [[San Francisco Mint]] (April 3, 1854), CC for the [[Carson City Mint]] (February 11, 1870), D again (Dahlonega had closed in 1861 never to reopen) now for the [[Denver Mint]] (March 12, 1906),  M for [[Manila Mint]] (July 15, 1920) (where an official US Mint began with the coinage of a one centavo coin on July 15, 1920) and lastly a W for the [[West Point Mint]]  The West Point Mint began coin production on July 29, 1974 to ease the shortage of quarters and other minor coinage and bore no mint mark. Thus West Point coins could not be distinguished from those made at the Philadelphia Mint. The West Point mint mark, \"W\", was first used on the $10 gold coins commemorating the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles.  Most Philadelphia Mint coins from earlier than 1980 were unmarked with the notable exception being wartime nickels (1942-1945).  The P mint mark was first used on the Susan B. Anthony Dollars starting 1979.  From 1980 until 2017, the [[Lincoln cent]] was the only coin that did not always have a mint mark, using a \"D\" when struck in Denver but lacking a \"P\" when ostensibly struck at the Philadelphia mint. This practice allowed the additional minting of coins at the San Francisco mint (\"S\") and West Point mint (\"W\") without the use of their respective mint marks to address circulating coinage needs without the concern of creating scarce varieties that would be plucked from circulation by collectors.  In the single year of 2017 the Philadelphia \"P\" was added to the Lincoln cent to celebrate 225 years of Philadelphia Mint service<ref>{{cite web|title=It's really true: Cents struck at Philadelphia Mint in 2017 bear P Mint mark|url=http://www.coinworld.com/news/us-coins/2017/01/p-mint-mark-added-to-lincoln-cent-for-first-time.all.html|publisher=Coin World|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>.  Generally 21st century coins with an \"S\" or \"W\" coins do not circulate, being mostly produced as [[bullion]], [[commemorative coin|commemorative]], [[proof coinage]] or other \"collector coinage\" sold by the US Mint to either authorized bullion wholesalers or directly to collectors.\n\nAlthough the US and several other countries use the initial letter of the city for its mint marks, this practice is not universal.  For instance, Germany used A for Berlin, D for Munich, E for Muldenhutten, F for Stuttgart, G for Karlsruhe and J for Hamburg.  When Spain adopted decimal coinage in 1848, it used stars with different numbers of points as mint marks. Madrid used six pointed stars, Barcelona used eight pointed stars, and so on.  After the revolution of 1868, small dates were placed in these stars.<ref>Standard Catalog of World Coins, C. Krause and C Michler, Spain</ref>  The small dates indicated the year the coin was struck, as opposed to the large date on the coin which was the year it was authorized.<ref>The Coin Atlas, Crib, Cook, and Carradice, p. 58</ref>\n\nMany mints of the world commonly use a [[Privy mark]], which is a symbol unique to each mint. The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] commonly uses a [[maple leaf]] privy mark.   Segovia, Spain used an aqueduct, a local landmark, before it switched over to the star system in 1868.  The private mint of the French Coinage Society Poissy Branch used a thunderbolt mint mark on coins of France, its colonies, Romania and other countries.<ref>Standard Catalog of World Coins, C.

This connotation no longer exists in the modern Japanese language, and any traditional Japanese-style residence of an appropriate age could be referred to as ''minka''.\n\n''Minka'' are characterised by their basic structure, their roof structure and their roof shape. ''Minka'' developed through history with distinctive styles emerging in the [[Edo period]].\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:Gassho-zukuri farmhouse-03.jpg|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-style roof]]\n[[Image:Gassho-zukuri farmhouse-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-zukuri under repair]]\nThe term ''minka'' literally means houses of the people. It covers houses that accommodated a wide variety of people from farmers to village headmen, merchants and low level samurai.<ref name = \"nishi, p82\">Nishi & Hozumi (1996), p82</ref>\n\n''Minka'' come in a wide range of styles and sizes, largely as a result of differing geographic and climatic conditions as well as the lifestyle of the inhabitants. They generally fall into one of four classifications: farmhouses {{nihongo|''n\u014dka''|\u8fb2\u5bb6|}} town houses {{nihongo|''[[machiya]]''|\u753a\u5c4b|}}, fishermen's dwellings {{nihongo|''[[gyoka]]''|\u6f01\u5bb6|}} and mountain dwellings {{nihongo|''sanka''|\u5c71\u5bb6|}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=minka | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/minka.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other forms of [[Japanese architecture]] (such as those of the {{nihongo|[[Sukiya-zukuri|sukiya]]|\u6570\u5bc4\u5c4b|}} style), it is the structure rather than the plan that is of primary importance to the minka.<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref> Minka are divided up with primary posts that form the basic framework and bear the structural load of the building; secondary posts are arranged to suit the functional arrangements of the plan.<ref name = \"itoh, p43\">Itoh (1979), p43</ref>\n\nDespite the wide variety of ''minka'', there are eight basic forms:\n* The 'inverted U' consists of two vertical posts fixed at the top with a horizontal beam; these units can then be joined with side girders. The beam can be fixed to the top of the post either by resting upon it or via a [[mortise and tenon]] joint. This latter method is often found in minka on the island of [[Shikoku]].<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref>\n* The 'ladder' has post and beam units connected with larger beams including beams that are closer to the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] level. This form of structure originated in townhouses of the [[Edo period]]. The system allows the irregular placement of posts and, therefore, allows flexibility in the plan.<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref> \n* With the 'umbrella' style, four beams radiate out from a central post. These posts sit at the centre of the square rather than the corners. Minka of this type are often found in [[Shiga Prefecture]].<ref name = \"itoh, p45\">Itoh (1979), p45</ref>\n* The 'cross' has two beams at right angles to one another with the posts in the centre of the sides. It is often used for very small minka that have no other posts erected in the space or for large minka in the earth-floored area. The style is most often found in Shiga and [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]] prefectures. \n* 'Parallel crosses' are found in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] and cover an area 5 metres by 10 metres. This system doubles up the 'cross' structure with two crosses and eight posts.\n* The 'box' structure connects four or more post and beam units to create a box-like structure. It was devised in the Edo period and can be found in [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] and [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]] prefectures.<ref name = \"itoh, p46\">Itoh (1979), p46</ref> \n* The 'interconnected box' can be found in [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]]. \n* 'Rising beams' is a form that enables better use of the second storey. It uses beams that rise from the posts to a secondary ridge that is below the one formed by the rafters.<ref name = \"itoh, p47\">Itoh (1979), p47</ref>\n** Thatched roof farmhouses based upon the 'rising beam' structure can be further classified into four major types. The ''yojiro-gumi'' and the {{nihongo|[[Japanese carpentry|wagoya]]|\u548c\u5c0f\u5c4b|}} are rare. The latter of these, the ''wagoya'', is popular for ''machiya'' houses. Far more common are the {{nihongo|sasu|\u6260\u9996|}} (also known as {{nihongo|gasshou|\u5408\u638c|}}) and the ''odachi'' types.<ref name = \"itoh, p81\">Itoh (1979), p81</ref><ref name=\"sasu\">{{cite web | title=sasu | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sasu.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ''odachi'' style has rafters, crossbeams and short vertical posts to support the ridge. Historically, these posts would have extended to the ground resulting in a row of posts extending down the centre of the house and dividing it. Although these could be accommodated in the layout of the main house, they were impractical in the earth-floored entrance area\u2014so they were omitted and a special beam structure used instead.<ref name=\"itoh, p111\">Itoh (1979), p110</ref> This style was in wide use until the Edo period when a shift was made to the ''sasu'' style (although both types had been used since historic times).<ref name = \"itoh, p84\">Itoh (1979), p84</ref>\n\nThe ''sasu'' style is a simpler triangular shape with a pair of rafters joined at the top to support the ridge pole. The ends of these rafters were sharpened to fit into mortice holes at either end of crossbeam.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> As this system does not rely on central posts it leaves a more unobstructed plan than the ''odachi'' style.<ref name = \"itoh, p111\">Itoh (1979), p110</ref>\n\n==Design of the floor plan==\n[[Image:\u795e\u6238\u5e02\u5317\u533a\u5317\u50e7\u5c3e\u306e\u53e4\u6c11\u5bb6P9149865.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorative roof projections on the ridge of a thatched roof]]\nThere were two main methods for setting out the floor plan of the minka. The {{nihongo|kyoma|\u4eac\u9593|}} method uses a standard size of {{nihongo|[[tatami]]|\u7573|}} mat, whereas the {{nihongo|inakama|\u7530\u820e\u9593|}} method is based upon column spacing.<ref name = \"engel, p78-81\">Engel (1980), p78-81</ref>\n\nThe ''kyoma'' method works well for minka without central columns as the mats and the sliding partitions ({{nihongo|[[fusuma]]|\u8956|}} and {{nihongo|[[sh\u014dji]]|\u969c\u5b50|}}) can be based on a standard size. It was mainly used in minka in eastern Japan.<ref name = \"itoh, p112\">Itoh (1979), p112</ref> The method has its disadvantages if used with posts because variations in post width can make the prefabrication of the sliding partitions difficult.<ref name = \"engel, p78-81\">Engel (1980), p78-81</ref>\n\nThe ''inakama'' method is based upon the distance between centre of one post and centre of the post adjacent to it and it was mainly used on the eastern side of Japan.<ref name = \"itoh, p112\">Itoh (1979), p112</ref>\n\n==Overall construction==\n\n[[Image:Udatsu closeup.jpg|thumb|250px|Tiled ''udatsu'' projecting above the roof]]\nThe size, construction and decoration of a minka was dependent upon its location, climate, and social status of its owner.<ref name = \"itoh, p70-72\">Itoh (1979), p70-72</ref>\n\nMinka were influenced by local building techniques and were built with materials that were abundant in the immediate locality. For example, minka in Shizuoka used abundant bamboo for roofs, eaves, doors and floors. When miscanthus reeds were difficult to obtain for thatched roofs, shingles were used instead; in volcanic areas rushes or boards were used instead of clay for the walls.<ref name = \"itoh, p118\">Itoh (1979), p118</ref>\n\nClimate had a bearing on construction: In Kyoto in the late [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] periods, roofs were clad in thin wooden shingles so owners would put stones on top to prevent the shingles from flying away in the wind.<ref name = \"itoh, p124\">Itoh (1979), p124</ref>\n\nThe social status of the ''minka'' owner was indicated by the size and complexity of the building. For thatched roof ''minka'' the number of crossed wooden members ({{nihongo|umanori|\u99ac\u4e57\u308a|}}) or bundles of miscanthus reeds along the ridge are a good indicator of the importance of the owner's status in the village.<ref name = \"itoh, p120\">Itoh (1979), p120</ref> For machiya, the presence and elaborateness of an ({{nihongo|udatsu|\u536f\u7acb|}})\u2014a wall that projects above the roof line\u2014has a similar status. The ''udatsu'' inherited the function of a fire break, but initially it was a method of establishing the extent of ownership in long terraces of row houses.<ref name = \"itoh, p122\">Itoh (1979), p122</ref>\n\nDuring the evolution of minka, the ''machiya'' townhouses gradually changed its construction away from perishable and flammable materials to those of a more durable nature. Thatched roofs were replaced with tiles and exposed timbers were covered up with layers of clay plastering.<ref>{{cite web | title=machiya | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/machiya.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nMinka owned by people of a higher social status began to incorporate elements of the [[Shoin-zukuri|shoin]] style, particularly in living rooms. The types of elements incorporated were limited by [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary laws]] to preserve strict class distinctions.<ref name=\"nishi, p82\"/>\n\n==Roofing==\n[[Image:Gokayama Japanese Old Village 002.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-zukuri ''minka'' homes in [[Gokayama]] surrounded by snow.]]\nThere are four types of roof shape that can be differentiated for minka. Most ''machiya'' have gabled {{nihongo|''kirizuma''|\u5207\u59bb|}} roofs, covered in shingles or tiles, and slanting down on either side of the house. The majority of ''n\u014dka'' have either thatched {{nihongo|''yosemune''|\u5bc4\u305b\u68df|}}-style hipped roofs, which slant down on four sides, or the more elaborate {{nihongo|''[[irimoya]]''|\u5165\u6bcd\u5c4b|}} roof with multiple gables and a combination of thatched sections and shingled sections. Finally, the {{nihongo|''hogyo''|\u65b9\u5f62|}} also slopes in four directions but is more pyramidal in shape.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\">Fahr-Becker (2001), p196</ref>\n\nThe primary purpose of shaping ''minka'' roofs was to accommodate the extensive precipitation experienced in many parts of Japan. A steeply peaked roof allows rain and snow to fall straight off, preventing water from getting through the roof into the home and, to a lesser extent, preventing the thatch from getting too wet and beginning to rot.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\" /><ref>{{cite web | title=kayabuki | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kayabuki.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\nAt the peak and other places where roof sections came together decorations were added. Thatched roofs would have trimmed or transverse layers of straw, bamboo poles or planks of wood.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\" /> Tiled roofs have a variety of decorative plates to the ends of the ridge, for example, {{nihongo|''shachi''|\u9bf1|}} (fish).<ref>{{cite web | title=shachi | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shachi.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref> They also had circular plates to the ends of the tiles at the eaves called {{nihongo|''gatou''|\u74e6\u5f53|}} that helped to deflect rain.<ref>{{cite web | title=gatou | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/g/gatou.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Farmhouse interior==\n[[Image:Japanese Traditional Hearth L4817.jpg|thumb|250px|''Irori'' (\u56f2\u7089\u88cf)]]\n[[Image:Kabuto Kazari -01.jpg|thumb|250px|A ''jizai kagi'' hearth hook with fish-shaped counterbalance]]\nThe deep eaves of the farmhouse roof helped to protect the interior from driving rain. They stop the sun from entering the interior during the summer, and they allow the low rays of sun to warm the house during the winter. Often there is a timber-floored veranda ({{nihongo|''[[engawa]]''|\u7e01\u5074 or \u63be\u5074|}}) around the house under the eaves and protected on the outside by storm shutters.

This connotation no longer exists in the modern Japanese language, and any traditional Japanese-style residence of an appropriate age could be referred to as ''minka''.\n\n''Minka'' are characterised by their basic structure, their roof structure and their roof shape. ''Minka'' developed through history with distinctive styles emerging in the [[Edo period]].\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:Gassho-zukuri farmhouse-03.jpg|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-style roof]]\n[[Image:Gassho-zukuri farmhouse-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-zukuri under repair]]\nThe term ''minka'' literally means houses of the people. It covers houses that accommodated a wide variety of people from farmers to village headmen, merchants and low level samurai.<ref name = \"nishi, p82\">Nishi & Hozumi (1996), p82</ref>\n\n''Minka'' come in a wide range of styles and sizes, largely as a result of differing geographic and climatic conditions as well as the lifestyle of the inhabitants. They generally fall into one of four classifications: farmhouses {{nihongo|''n\u014dka''|\u8fb2\u5bb6|}} town houses {{nihongo|''[[machiya]]''|\u753a\u5c4b|}}, fishermen's dwellings {{nihongo|''[[gyoka]]''|\u6f01\u5bb6|}} and mountain dwellings {{nihongo|''sanka''|\u5c71\u5bb6|}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=minka | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/minka.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other forms of [[Japanese architecture]] (such as those of the {{nihongo|[[Sukiya-zukuri|sukiya]]|\u6570\u5bc4\u5c4b|}} style), it is the structure rather than the plan that is of primary importance to the minka.<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref> Minka are divided up with primary posts that form the basic framework and bear the structural load of the building; secondary posts are arranged to suit the functional arrangements of the plan.<ref name = \"itoh, p43\">Itoh (1979), p43</ref>\n\nDespite the wide variety of ''minka'', there are eight basic forms:\n* The 'inverted U' consists of two vertical posts fixed at the top with a horizontal beam; these units can then be joined with side girders. The beam can be fixed to the top of the post either by resting upon it or via a [[mortise and tenon]] joint. This latter method is often found in minka on the island of [[Shikoku]].<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref>\n* The 'ladder' has post and beam units connected with larger beams including beams that are closer to the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] level. This form of structure originated in townhouses of the [[Edo period]]. The system allows the irregular placement of posts and, therefore, allows flexibility in the plan.<ref name = \"itoh, p44\">Itoh (1979), p44</ref> \n* With the 'umbrella' style, four beams radiate out from a central post. These posts sit at the centre of the square rather than the corners. Minka of this type are often found in [[Shiga Prefecture]].<ref name = \"itoh, p45\">Itoh (1979), p45</ref>\n* The 'cross' has two beams at right angles to one another with the posts in the centre of the sides. It is often used for very small minka that have no other posts erected in the space or for large minka in the earth-floored area. The style is most often found in Shiga and [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]] prefectures. \n* 'Parallel crosses' are found in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] and cover an area 5 metres by 10 metres. This system doubles up the 'cross' structure with two crosses and eight posts.\n* The 'box' structure connects four or more post and beam units to create a box-like structure. It was devised in the Edo period and can be found in [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] and [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]] prefectures.<ref name = \"itoh, p46\">Itoh (1979), p46</ref> \n* The 'interconnected box' can be found in [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]]. \n* 'Rising beams' is a form that enables better use of the second storey. It uses beams that rise from the posts to a secondary ridge that is below the one formed by the rafters.<ref name = \"itoh, p47\">Itoh (1979), p47</ref>\n** Thatched roof farmhouses based upon the 'rising beam' structure can be further classified into four major types. The ''yojiro-gumi'' and the {{nihongo|[[Japanese carpentry|wagoya]]|\u548c\u5c0f\u5c4b|}} are rare. The latter of these, the ''wagoya'', is popular for ''machiya'' houses. Far more common are the {{nihongo|sasu|\u6260\u9996|}} (also known as {{nihongo|gasshou|\u5408\u638c|}}) and the ''odachi'' types.<ref name = \"itoh, p81\">Itoh (1979), p81</ref><ref name=\"sasu\">{{cite web | title=sasu | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sasu.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ''odachi'' style has rafters, crossbeams and short vertical posts to support the ridge. Historically, these posts would have extended to the ground resulting in a row of posts extending down the centre of the house and dividing it. Although these could be accommodated in the layout of the main house, they were impractical in the earth-floored entrance area\u2014so they were omitted and a special beam structure used instead.<ref name=\"itoh, p111\">Itoh (1979), p110</ref> This style was in wide use until the Edo period when a shift was made to the ''sasu'' style (although both types had been used since historic times).<ref name = \"itoh, p84\">Itoh (1979), p84</ref>\n\nThe ''sasu'' style is a simpler triangular shape with a pair of rafters joined at the top to support the ridge pole. The ends of these rafters were sharpened to fit into mortice holes at either end of crossbeam.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> As this system does not rely on central posts it leaves a more unobstructed plan than the ''odachi'' style.<ref name = \"itoh, p111\">Itoh (1979), p110</ref>\n\n==Design of the floor plan==\n[[Image:\u795e\u6238\u5e02\u5317\u533a\u5317\u50e7\u5c3e\u306e\u53e4\u6c11\u5bb6P9149865.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorative roof projections on the ridge of a thatched roof]]\nThere were two main methods for setting out the floor plan of the minka. The {{nihongo|kyoma|\u4eac\u9593|}} method uses a standard size of {{nihongo|[[tatami]]|\u7573|}} mat, whereas the {{nihongo|inakama|\u7530\u820e\u9593|}} method is based upon column spacing.<ref name = \"engel, p78-81\">Engel (1980), p78-81</ref>\n\nThe ''kyoma'' method works well for minka without central columns as the mats and the sliding partitions ({{nihongo|[[fusuma]]|\u8956|}} and {{nihongo|[[sh\u014dji]]|\u969c\u5b50|}}) can be based on a standard size. It was mainly used in minka in eastern Japan.<ref name = \"itoh, p112\">Itoh (1979), p112</ref> The method has its disadvantages if used with posts because variations in post width can make the prefabrication of the sliding partitions difficult.<ref name = \"engel, p78-81\">Engel (1980), p78-81</ref>\n\nThe ''inakama'' method is based upon the distance between centre of one post and centre of the post adjacent to it and it was mainly used on the eastern side of Japan.<ref name = \"itoh, p112\">Itoh (1979), p112</ref>\n\n==Overall construction==\n\n[[Image:Udatsu closeup.jpg|thumb|250px|Tiled ''udatsu'' projecting above the roof]]\nThe size, construction and decoration of a minka was dependent upon its location, climate, and social status of its owner.<ref name = \"itoh, p70-72\">Itoh (1979), p70-72</ref>\n\nMinka were influenced by local building techniques and were built with materials that were abundant in the immediate locality. For example, minka in Shizuoka used abundant bamboo for roofs, eaves, doors and floors. When miscanthus reeds were difficult to obtain for thatched roofs, shingles were used instead; in volcanic areas rushes or boards were used instead of clay for the walls.<ref name = \"itoh, p118\">Itoh (1979), p118</ref>\n\nClimate had a bearing on construction: In Kyoto in the late [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] periods, roofs were clad in thin wooden shingles so owners would put stones on top to prevent the shingles from flying away in the wind.<ref name = \"itoh, p124\">Itoh (1979), p124</ref>\n\nThe social status of the ''minka'' owner was indicated by the size and complexity of the building. For thatched roof ''minka'' the number of crossed wooden members ({{nihongo|umanori|\u99ac\u4e57\u308a|}}) or bundles of miscanthus reeds along the ridge are a good indicator of the importance of the owner's status in the village.<ref name = \"itoh, p120\">Itoh (1979), p120</ref> For machiya, the presence and elaborateness of an ({{nihongo|udatsu|\u536f\u7acb|}})\u2014a wall that projects above the roof line\u2014has a similar status. The ''udatsu'' inherited the function of a fire break, but initially it was a method of establishing the extent of ownership in long terraces of row houses.<ref name = \"itoh, p122\">Itoh (1979), p122</ref>\n\nDuring the evolution of minka, the ''machiya'' townhouses gradually changed its construction away from perishable and flammable materials to those of a more durable nature. Thatched roofs were replaced with tiles and exposed timbers were covered up with layers of clay plastering.<ref>{{cite web | title=machiya | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/machiya.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nMinka owned by people of a higher social status began to incorporate elements of the [[Shoin-zukuri|shoin]] style, particularly in living rooms. The types of elements incorporated were limited by [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary laws]] to preserve strict class distinctions.<ref name=\"nishi, p82\"/>\n\n==Roofing==\n[[Image:Gokayama Japanese Old Village 002.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Gassh\u014d-zukuri ''minka'' homes in [[Gokayama]] surrounded by snow.]]\nThere are four types of roof shape that can be differentiated for minka. Most ''machiya'' have gabled {{nihongo|''kirizuma''|\u5207\u59bb|}} roofs, covered in shingles or tiles, and slanting down on either side of the house. The majority of ''n\u014dka'' have either thatched {{nihongo|''yosemune''|\u5bc4\u305b\u68df|}}-style hipped roofs, which slant down on four sides, or the more elaborate {{nihongo|''[[irimoya]]''|\u5165\u6bcd\u5c4b|}} roof with multiple gables and a combination of thatched sections and shingled sections. Finally, the {{nihongo|''hogyo''|\u65b9\u5f62|}} also slopes in four directions but is more pyramidal in shape.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\">Fahr-Becker (2001), p196</ref>\n\nThe primary purpose of shaping ''minka'' roofs was to accommodate the extensive precipitation experienced in many parts of Japan. A steeply peaked roof allows rain and snow to fall straight off, preventing water from getting through the roof into the home and, to a lesser extent, preventing the thatch from getting too wet and beginning to rot.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\" /><ref>{{cite web | title=kayabuki | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kayabuki.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\nAt the peak and other places where roof sections came together decorations were added. Thatched roofs would have trimmed or transverse layers of straw, bamboo poles or planks of wood.<ref name = \"fahr, p196\" /> Tiled roofs have a variety of decorative plates to the ends of the ridge, for example, {{nihongo|''shachi''|\u9bf1|}} (fish).<ref>{{cite web | title=shachi | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shachi.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref> They also had circular plates to the ends of the tiles at the eaves called {{nihongo|''gatou''|\u74e6\u5f53|}} that helped to deflect rain.<ref>{{cite web | title=gatou | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/g/gatou.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Farmhouse interior==\n[[Image:Japanese Traditional Hearth L4817.jpg|thumb|250px|''Irori'' (\u56f2\u7089\u88cf)]]\n[[Image:Kabuto Kazari -01.jpg|thumb|250px|A ''jizai kagi'' hearth hook with fish-shaped counterbalance]]\nThe deep eaves of the farmhouse roof helped to protect the interior from driving rain. They stop the sun from entering the interior during the summer, and they allow the low rays of sun to warm the house during the winter. Often there is a timber-floored veranda ({{nihongo|''[[engawa]]''|\u7e01\u5074 or \u63be\u5074|}}) around the house under the eaves and protected on the outside by storm shutters. In areas where there is heavy snow there may be a lowered earth-floored area outside the veranda further protected by shutters which helps to stop snow from blowing inside.<ref name = \"itoh, p66-68\">Itoh (1979), p66-68</ref>\n\nThe interior of a ''minka'' was generally divided into two sections: a floor of compacted earth, called a {{nihongo|''doma''|[[Wiktionary:\u571f\u9593|\u571f\u9593]]}} and a raised floor (generally around 20&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;cm) above the level of the ''doma''), called a {{nihongo|''hiroma''|[[Wiktionary:\u5e83\u9593|\u5e83\u9593]]}}, and, in larger, richer houses, an area or set of rooms covered in tatami or ''mushiro'' mats, called a {{nihongo|''zashiki''|[[Wiktionary:\u5ea7\u6577|\u5ea7\u6577]]}}<ref name=\"minka\">{{cite web | title=minka | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/minka.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>.  Large farmhouses sometimes had a raised, timber-floored internal veranda ({{nihongo|''hiroshiki''|[[Wiktionary:\u5e83\u6577|\u5e83\u6577]]}}) that separated the ''doma'' and the ''tatami'' areas.<ref name=\"nishi, p82\"/> In older houses, like the 17th century Yoshimura house, this separating zone was up to 2.5&nbsp;m wide and servants apparently slept there.<ref>{{cite web | title=hiroshiki | url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hiroshiki.htm | publisher=JAANUS | accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\nThe raised floor often included a built-in hearth, called an {{nihongo|[[irori]]|[[Wiktionary:\u56f2\u7089\u88cf|\u56f2\u7089\u88cf]]}}. Above the ash-filled hearth would hang a kettle suspended from the ceiling by an adjustable hearth hook made of wood, metal and bamboo. This {{nihongo|''jizai kagi''|[[Wiktionary:\u81ea\u5728\u920e|\u81ea\u5728\u920e]]}} could be raised or lowered depending on the amount of heat required and was often shaped into decorative fish or blade shapes.<ref name = \"fahr, p191\">Fahr-Becker (2001), p191</ref> There was no chimney in the farmhouse and the smoke from the ''irori'' would rise through the roof drying the reeds and deterring insects.

This concept is similar to the Christian notion of Jesus being both god and man, a foundational idea in [[Christian theology]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. [[Eunapius]] reported that Plotinus was born in the [[Lycopolis (Delta)|Deltaic Lycopolis]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which has led to speculations that he may have been either native [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Egyptian,<ref>Bilolo, M.: ''La notion de \u00ab l\u2019Un \u00bb dans les Enn\u00e9ades de Plotin et dans les Hymnes th\u00e9bains.

This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth<ref name=\":0\" />. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].\n\n=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].<ref>Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, \"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians\").</ref> In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Beauty and the mystic : Plotinus and Hawkins|last=Leete, Helen, 1938-|isbn=9780987524836|location=Epping, N.S.W|oclc=967937243}}</ref> There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].<ref>Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that \"to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death\"</ref> Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n=== Later life ===\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.\"<ref>Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic Saints: The Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by Their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 n. 20.</ref> Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' (from Greek ''\u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03ad\u03b1'' (enn\u00e9a), or group of nine) over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the ''Enneads'', before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\n== Major ideas ==\n\n=== One ===\n{{See also|Substance theory}}\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"[[Henology|One]]\", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]]. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" (III.8.11) Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd, ''to En''; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine Intellect/[[Nous]] (\u039d\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, ''Nous''; first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul (\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'') to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world\u2014but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110\u2013123</ref> Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p. 122</ref>\n\n=== Emanation by the One ===\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae ''aporrhoe'' (\u0399\u0399.3.2) or \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/ Plotinus (204\u2014270 C.E.)]</ref>\n\nThe first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''Nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]]. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lander|first=Janis|title=Spiritual Art and Art Education|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page= 76|isbn=9781134667895}}</ref>\n\n=== The true human and happiness ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The philosophy of Plotinus has always exerted a peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent with things as they are has led them to seek the realities behind what they took to be merely the appearances of the sense.\n |source = ''The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads'', p. vii<ref name=\"Plotinus1950\">{{cite book|author=Plotinus|title=The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofplot032843mbp|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1950|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=vii}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus \u201c\u2026 there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.\u201d (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus\u2019 greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. \u201cFor man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.\u201d (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human\u2019s \u201c\u2026 Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.\u201d (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. \u201cThe perfect life\u201d involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body\u2019s discomfort in the physical realm. \u201c\u2026 The Proficient\u2019s will is set always and only inward.\u201d (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"... a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.\n\n===Henosis===\n{{main|Henosis}}\n\nHenosis is the word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\", or \"unity\" in classical Greek. In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2|\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].<ref>Stamatellos, Giannis.

SUNY Press, 2007, p. 37 {{ISBN|0791470628}}</ref>\n\nAs is specified in the writings of Plotinus on [[henology]], one can reach a state of [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus: <br>* \"Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. (6.9.7)<br>* \"If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself.\" (6.9.11)}} This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the ''Enneads'' of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]'' by Richard T.

All division is reconciled in the one; the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being; being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Gaia hypothesis|World Soul]]).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nHenosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[Nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with [[Aristotle]] but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere).\" (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7 7)</ref>\n\n==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==\n\n=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===\n{{see also|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}\n\nFor several centuries after the [[Protestant Reformation]], Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'<ref>E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.</ref> Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'<ref>Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|T\u00fcbingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the T\u00fcbingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.<ref>Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''</ref>\n\n=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===\n{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\n\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"\u2014or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"\u2014ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).\n\nAccording to A. H. Armstrong, Plotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism{{clarification needed|date=October 2019}} as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A.

There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin).

Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222:<br />Ridiculous arrogance of the Gnostics who refuse to acknowledge the hierarchy of created gods and spirits and say that they alone are sons of God and superior to the heavens (Enneads ch. 9)}} Armstrong believed that Plotinus also attacks them as elitist and blasphemous to Plato for the Gnostics despising the material world and its maker.{{refn|group=note|They claim to be a privileged caste of beings, in whom alone God is interested, and who are saved not by their own efforts but by some dramatic and arbitrary divine proceeding; and this, Plotinus says, leads to immorality. Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220\u2013222}}\n\nFor decades, Armstrong's was the only translation available of Plotinus. For this reason, his claims were authoritative. However, a modern translation by Lloyd P. Gerson doesn't necessarily support all of Armstrong's views. Unlike Armstrong, Gerson didn't find Plotinus to be so vitriolic against the Gnostics.<ref name=\"gerson\">{{cite book |title=Plotinus: The Enneads |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107001770 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCw2yAEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref> According to Gerson:\n{{quote|As Plotinus himself tells us, at the time of this treatise\u2019s composition some of his friends were \u2018attached\u2019 to Gnostic doctrine, and he believed that this attachment was harmful. So he sets out here a number of objections and corrections. Some of these are directed at very specific tenets of Gnosticism, e.g. the introduction of a \u2018new earth\u2019 or a principle of \u2018Wisdom\u2019, but the general thrust of this treatise has a much broader scope. The Gnostics are very critical of the sensible universe and its contents, and as a Platonist, Plotinus must share this critical attitude to some extent. But here he makes his case that the proper understanding of the highest principles and emanation forces us to respect the sensible world as the best possible imitation of the intelligible world.}}\n\nPlotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect of Christian Gnostics that held anti-polytheistic and anti-daemon views, and that preached salvation was possible without struggle.<ref name=\"gerson\" /> At one point, Plotinus makes clear that his major grudge is the way Gnostics 'misused' Plato's teachings, and not their own teachings themselves:\n{{quote|There are no hard feelings if they tell us in which respects they intend to disagree with Plato [...] Rather, whatever strikes them as their own distinct views in comparison with the Greeks\u2019, these views \u2013 as well as the views that contradict them \u2013 should be forthrightly set out on their own in a considerate and philosophical manner.}}\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|\"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism\".<ref>''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G. Routledge & Sons, LTD, p. 294</ref>}} Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the ''Enneads'', but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood.<ref name=\"Stanford1\" /> Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[misotheism]] or [[Eutheism and dystheism|dystheism]] of the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.\n\n=== Against causal astrology ===\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\nThe emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious Competition in the Greco-Roman World|last=Dingeldein|first=Laura B.|publisher=SBL Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0884141587|editor-last=DesRosiers|editor-first=Nathaniel P.|location=Atlanta|pages=119\u2013129|chapter=Julian's Philosophy and His Religious Program|editor-last2=Vuong|editor-first2=Lily C.}}</ref> as was [[Hypatia|Hypatia of Alexandria]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia|title=Hypatia|last=[[Michael A.

In ''A History of Western Philosophy'', philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that:\n{{quote|To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance. Christian theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much of the philosophy of Plotinus. [...] Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of theology.<ref>\"A History of Western Philosophy.\" Bertrand Russell. Simon and Schuster, INC. 1945. pp. 284\u2013285</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory Palamas]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Islam ===\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]]s fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]]<ref name=\"halm 176\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 176.</ref> and Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and [[Abu Yaqub Sijistani]]. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the [[Fatimid]] state of Egypt, and taught by their [[da'i (Islam)|da'i]].<ref name=\"halm 176\"/> Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with the original teachings of Plotinus.<ref name=\"halm 177\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 177.</ref> The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as [[Nasir Khusraw]] of Persia.<ref name=\"halm 177\"/>\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonist themes are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: [[Maimonides]]). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''.\n\n=== England ===\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[Kathleen Raine]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Michaud |first1=Derek |title=Reason Turned into Sense: John Smith on Spiritual Sensation |date=2017 |publisher=Peeters |pages=102-105, 114, 115, 129, 137, 146, 153, 154, 155, 172, 174, 175, 177-178, 180, 181, 181, 184, 185, 188, 195 |url=https://g.co/kgs/BUWJsx}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.yeatsvision.com/Plotinus.html |title = W.

Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]''. His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings have inspired centuries of [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] and [[mysticism|mystics]], including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states. This concept is similar to the Christian notion of Jesus being both god and man, a foundational idea in [[Christian theology]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. [[Eunapius]] reported that Plotinus was born in the [[Lycopolis (Delta)|Deltaic Lycopolis]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which has led to speculations that he may have been either native [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Egyptian,<ref>Bilolo, M.: ''La notion de \u00ab l\u2019Un \u00bb dans les Enn\u00e9ades de Plotin et dans les Hymnes th\u00e9bains.

Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003.</ref>\n\nPlotinus had an inherent distrust of materiality (an attitude common to [[Platonism]]), holding to the view that phenomena were a poor image or mimicry ([[mimesis]]) of something \"higher and intelligible\" (VI.I) which was the \"truer part of genuine Being\". This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth<ref name=\":0\" />. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].\n\n=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].<ref>Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, \"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians\").</ref> In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Beauty and the mystic : Plotinus and Hawkins|last=Leete, Helen, 1938-|isbn=9780987524836|location=Epping, N.S.W|oclc=967937243}}</ref> There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].<ref>Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that \"to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death\"</ref> Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n=== Later life ===\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.\"<ref>Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic Saints: The Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by Their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 n. 20.</ref> Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' (from Greek ''\u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03ad\u03b1'' (enn\u00e9a), or group of nine) over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the ''Enneads'', before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\n== Major ideas ==\n\n=== One ===\n{{See also|Substance theory}}\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"[[Henology|One]]\", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]]. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" (III.8.11) Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd, ''to En''; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine Intellect/[[Nous]] (\u039d\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, ''Nous''; first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul (\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'') to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world\u2014but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110\u2013123</ref> Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p. 122</ref>\n\n=== Emanation by the One ===\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae ''aporrhoe'' (\u0399\u0399.3.2) or \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/ Plotinus (204\u2014270 C.E.)]</ref>\n\nThe first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''Nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]]. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lander|first=Janis|title=Spiritual Art and Art Education|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page= 76|isbn=9781134667895}}</ref>\n\n=== The true human and happiness ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The philosophy of Plotinus has always exerted a peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent with things as they are has led them to seek the realities behind what they took to be merely the appearances of the sense.\n |source = ''The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads'', p. vii<ref name=\"Plotinus1950\">{{cite book|author=Plotinus|title=The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofplot032843mbp|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1950|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=vii}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus \u201c\u2026 there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.\u201d (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus\u2019 greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. \u201cFor man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.\u201d (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human\u2019s \u201c\u2026 Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.\u201d (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. \u201cThe perfect life\u201d involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body\u2019s discomfort in the physical realm. \u201c\u2026 The Proficient\u2019s will is set always and only inward.\u201d (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"... a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.\n\n===Henosis===\n{{main|Henosis}}\n\nHenosis is the word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\", or \"unity\" in classical Greek. In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2|\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].<ref>Stamatellos, Giannis. ''Plotinus and the Presocratics: A Philosophical Study of Presocratic Influences in Plotinus' Enneads''. SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy. SUNY Press, 2007, p. 37 {{ISBN|0791470628}}</ref>\n\nAs is specified in the writings of Plotinus on [[henology]], one can reach a state of [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus: <br>* \"Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. (6.9.7)<br>* \"If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself.\" (6.9.11)}} This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the ''Enneads'' of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]'' by Richard T.

All division is reconciled in the one; the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being; being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Gaia hypothesis|World Soul]]).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nHenosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[Nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with [[Aristotle]] but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere).\" (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7 7)</ref>\n\n==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==\n\n=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===\n{{see also|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}\n\nFor several centuries after the [[Protestant Reformation]], Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'<ref>E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.</ref> Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'<ref>Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|T\u00fcbingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the T\u00fcbingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.<ref>Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''</ref>\n\n=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===\n{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\n\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"\u2014or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"\u2014ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).\n\nAccording to A. H. Armstrong, Plotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism{{clarification needed|date=October 2019}} as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222:<br />The treatise as it stands in the ''[[Enneads]]'' is a most powerful protest on behalf of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] philosophy against the un-Hellenic [[heresy]] (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.}} Also according to Armstrong, Plotinus accused them of using senseless jargon and being overly dramatic and insolent in their distortion of Plato's ontology.\"{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A.

Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220\u2013222}}\n\nFor decades, Armstrong's was the only translation available of Plotinus. For this reason, his claims were authoritative. However, a modern translation by Lloyd P. Gerson doesn't necessarily support all of Armstrong's views. Unlike Armstrong, Gerson didn't find Plotinus to be so vitriolic against the Gnostics.<ref name=\"gerson\">{{cite book |title=Plotinus: The Enneads |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107001770 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCw2yAEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref> According to Gerson:\n{{quote|As Plotinus himself tells us, at the time of this treatise\u2019s composition some of his friends were \u2018attached\u2019 to Gnostic doctrine, and he believed that this attachment was harmful. So he sets out here a number of objections and corrections. Some of these are directed at very specific tenets of Gnosticism, e.g. the introduction of a \u2018new earth\u2019 or a principle of \u2018Wisdom\u2019, but the general thrust of this treatise has a much broader scope. The Gnostics are very critical of the sensible universe and its contents, and as a Platonist, Plotinus must share this critical attitude to some extent. But here he makes his case that the proper understanding of the highest principles and emanation forces us to respect the sensible world as the best possible imitation of the intelligible world.}}\n\nPlotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect of Christian Gnostics that held anti-polytheistic and anti-daemon views, and that preached salvation was possible without struggle.<ref name=\"gerson\" /> At one point, Plotinus makes clear that his major grudge is the way Gnostics 'misused' Plato's teachings, and not their own teachings themselves:\n{{quote|There are no hard feelings if they tell us in which respects they intend to disagree with Plato [...] Rather, whatever strikes them as their own distinct views in comparison with the Greeks\u2019, these views \u2013 as well as the views that contradict them \u2013 should be forthrightly set out on their own in a considerate and philosophical manner.}}\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|\"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism\".<ref>''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G. Routledge & Sons, LTD, p. 294</ref>}} Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the ''Enneads'', but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood.<ref name=\"Stanford1\" /> Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[misotheism]] or [[Eutheism and dystheism|dystheism]] of the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.\n\n=== Against causal astrology ===\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\nThe emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious Competition in the Greco-Roman World|last=Dingeldein|first=Laura B.|publisher=SBL Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0884141587|editor-last=DesRosiers|editor-first=Nathaniel P.|location=Atlanta|pages=119\u2013129|chapter=Julian's Philosophy and His Religious Program|editor-last2=Vuong|editor-first2=Lily C.}}</ref> as was [[Hypatia|Hypatia of Alexandria]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia|title=Hypatia|last=[[Michael A.

In ''A History of Western Philosophy'', philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that:\n{{quote|To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance. Christian theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much of the philosophy of Plotinus. [...] Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of theology.<ref>\"A History of Western Philosophy.\" Bertrand Russell. Simon and Schuster, INC. 1945. pp. 284\u2013285</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory Palamas]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Islam ===\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]]s fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]]<ref name=\"halm 176\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 176.</ref> and Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and [[Abu Yaqub Sijistani]]. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the [[Fatimid]] state of Egypt, and taught by their [[da'i (Islam)|da'i]].<ref name=\"halm 176\"/> Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with the original teachings of Plotinus.<ref name=\"halm 177\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 177.</ref> The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as [[Nasir Khusraw]] of Persia.<ref name=\"halm 177\"/>\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonist themes are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: [[Maimonides]]). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''.\n\n=== England ===\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W.

It is no longer widely played. ''Minchiate'' can also refer to the special deck of 97 [[playing cards]] used in the game. The deck is closely related to the [[tarot]] cards, but contains an expanded suit of [[trump (card games)|trump]]s.  The game was similar to but more complex than [[tarocchi]]. The minchiate represents a Florentine variant on the original game.\n\n==History==\nFlorence is one of the contenders for the birthplace of tarot. The earliest reference to tarot cards, then known as [[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], is dated to 1440 when a notary in Florence recorded the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].<ref>Pratesi, Franco. [http://trionfi.com/giusto-giusti Studies on Giusto Giusti] at trionfi.com. Retrieved 3 March 2016.</ref>\n\nThe word ''minchiate'' comes from a dialect word meaning \"[[nonsense]]\" or \"trifle\", derived from ''mencla,'' the vulgar form of ''mentula'', a Latin word for \"phallus\".<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mario Alinei|title=L'etimologia di it. ''minchione'', it. ''mer.'' ''minchia'' e lat. ''mentula''|journal=Quaderni di Semantica|publisher=Il Mulino|date=2015|number=1|pp=407\u2013415|issn=0393 1226|language=it}}</ref> The word ''minchione'' is attested in [[Italian language|Italian]] as meaning \"fool\", and ''minchionare'' means \"to laugh at\" someone.  The intended meaning may be \"the game of the fool\", considering that the card \"[[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]]\", also called \"The Excuse\", features prominently in the game play of all tarot games. In [[tarocchini]], ''sminchiate'' is a signal used to communicate to a teammate.\n[[File:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|left|Popess from the Rosenwald sheet.]]\nThe earliest reference to minchiate is found in a 1466 letter by [[Luigi Pulci]] to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. However, this game was believed to be played by a 78-card deck as evidenced by the Rosenwald sheets, uncut sheets of Florentine tarots dated from 1480 to 1500.<ref>[https://www.nga.gov/global-site-search-page.html?searchterm=tarocchi+woodcut Rosenwald sheets] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved 13 October 2017.</ref> There are two other differences from 97-card minchiate. First, in 97-card minchiate the sequence for some of the lower trumps goes from lowest to highest: [[Strength (Tarot card)|Fortitude]], [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], [[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel]], and [[Chariot (Tarot card)|Chariot]]. In the Rosenwald ordering it is Justice, Fortitude, Chariot, and Wheel. Second, the Rosenwald sheets contains the [[The High Priestess|Popess]] as the second trump which is not found in the 97-card deck. In a Florentine song written around 1500, the trumps in a tarot deck were listed as almost exactly as the Rosenwald sheets with the exception of the missing Popess which likely means that this card was dropped from the deck by that time.<ref name=\"Depaulis\">{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Early Italian Lists of Tarot Trumps|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=39\u201347}}</ref> The song also ranks the other trumps as Fortitude, Justice, Chariot, and Wheel, which suggests it is a transitional stage from the Rosenwald sheets to the 97-card deck's order.\n\n97-card minchiate was first known as ''germini'', after the Gemini (XXXV) card, the highest of the newly introduced trumps. The earliest record of germini dates to 1506.<ref name=\"Pratesi\">{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=1499-1506: Firenze|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2015|volume=44|issue=1|pages=61\u201371}}</ref> This deck was created by inserting the 20 new trumps as a single block between trump 15 and [[The Star (Tarot card)|The Star]], which is now trump 36. The new deck proved so much more popular that the 77-card deck ceased production and the older name of minchiate was transferred over to the larger deck during the 17th century. The game spread from Florence to the rest of Italy and France during that century. In [[Sicily]], it was called ''gallerini'' while in [[Liguria]] it was known as ''ganellini'' but the rules used in these regions are lost save for cryptic references that they were quite different from the Florentine game. All surviving rules are derived from the type played in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Papal States]].\n\nBy the 18th century, minchiate had overtaken the original game of tarot in popularity in Italy.  Paolo Minucci published a commentary on the game in 1676, and the game is described in detail by Romain Merlin in ''Origine des cartes \u00e0 jouer'', published in [[Paris]] in 1869. It was also known in Germany during the late 18th century. The game was still played in [[Genoa]] in the 1930s, but its popularity declined in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Deck==\n[[File:Vitoria - Bibat 019a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lucca]] version cards]]\nThe minchiate deck differs from other tarot decks in several features. The first and most obvious difference is that the trumps have almost doubled in number; there are 40 trumps in the minchiate, in addition to the unnumbered card the Madman, [[The Fool (tarot card)|The Fool]] or the excuse. Minchiate uses [[Roman numerals#Alternative forms|additive Roman numerals]] for its trumps. Due to the large number of trumps, players generally called them by their number with the exception of the ''arie''.\n\nMinchiate decks come in two standard patterns, earlier and later, which coexisted for almost two centuries. Earlier Minchiate dates from the early 16th century or even the late 15th century.<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-28.html Earlier Minchiate pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

Since the five lowest trumps were collectively known as the ''papi'' (popes), Love was added to this group after its demotion. The identification of middle ''papi'' was largely forgotten for centuries as players generally called cards by their number (pope 2, pope 3, etc.) French writer Romain Merlin (1869) is the only source that called trumps II, III, and IIII the Grand Duke, Western Emperor, and Eastern Emperor.\n\n[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], Fortitude, and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] were three classical \"[[cardinal virtues]]\" depicted in the more familiar tarot trumps. The minchiate supplies the remaining cardinal virtue&nbsp;\u2014 [[Prudence]]&nbsp;\u2014 and inserts them with the three [[theological virtues]], [[Faith]], [[Hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]].  The only other deck to have the theological virtues was the [[Visconti-Sforza tarot deck|Cary-Yale deck]]. This is the only deck to include all [[seven virtues]].\n\nMinchiate is a southern tarot pattern so it shares many qualities with the [[Tarocco Bolognese|Bolognese]] and [[Tarocco Siciliano|Sicilian tarots]] as opposed to the western patterns like the tarot of Marseilles. While the [[The Tower (Tarot card)|Tower]] is called The House of God in the Marseilles tarot, it is called the House of the Devil or Hellmouth in the minchiate deck  and it depicts a nude woman fleeing a burning building. The Moon depicts an [[astrology|astrologer]] studying the moon instead of the tarot of Marseilles howling dogs and lobster. The card corresponding to the Hermit is often called Time, or the Hunchback; it depicts an elderly man on crutches with an hourglass in the background. Like other southern decks, the final card in the series is not the World, but Judgement. The minchiate completes the series by adding all the [[zodiac]] signs (in random order) and the four [[classical element]]s.\n\nThe eight highest ranking trumps have a red background while the top five (the ''arie'') are unnumbered. A 98th card was made for some decks.<ref name=\"History\" /> It is a trump with a red background and is also unnumbered like the ''arie''. It depicts a nude woman running in a wheel, probably representing [[Fortuna]]. While 98-card decks were mentioned as being played in Sicily during the early 18th century, only a few examples from Genoa survive. It is uncertain how this card ranked and how it affected the versicole sequences in the game. Also unknown is how it relates to the 98-card version of the Minchiate Francesi described below.\n\n=== Educational Minchiate ===\nEducational decks were produced in Florence during the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|page=49}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Tarot, jeu et magie|date=1984|publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]|location=Paris|pages=85\u201386}}</ref> Instead of the usual figures and pips, each card would have text explaining a certain topic. One history deck has each suit teaching the history of Assyria, Persia, Greece, or Rome with the trumps teaching myths and legends. Geography decks contained maps of the known world.\n\n=== Minchiate Francesi ===\n[[File:Momus Tarot.jpg|thumb|Momus as the Fool in the 97-card deck]]\nThe '''Minchiate Francesi''', also called '''Minchiate de Poilly''' after its attribution to engraver [[Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly]] (1623\u201393) and his son (1666-1741) who had the same name, refer to 3 different French decks utilizing the same set of engravings. The first has 42 numbered trumps, the second has 40 numbered trumps and [[Momus]] as an unnumbered card and lacks the first's \"Le Chaos\" card, the third has 21 numbered trumps and Momus as an unnumbered card. The intended game for the first deck is unknown, but the second appears to be intended to be played like the Italian Minchiate while the third deck appears to be intended for ordinary Tarot (despite still being called a Minchiate deck). The order of the motifs for the two latter decks have been rearranged compared to the first deck to more closely resemble their Italian counterparts. All three decks have the same 56 plain suit cards with [[French playing cards|French suits]] with each suit representing a different continent; spades for Africa, hearts for Europe, clubs for the Americas, and diamonds for Asia. The engravings share motifs with both the Italian Minchiate and the [[Tarot Nouveau]] as well as taking unique motifs from [[Roman Mythology]].<ref>''Origine des cartes \u00e0 jouer'', Romain Merlin, Paris, 1869.

Like the 54-card [[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]] pattern, the plain suits consists of only 32 cards while the 40 trumps feature rustic [[genre scenes]]. With the ''Sk\u00fcs'' (the Fool), the total number of cards is 73. Compounding the mystery is that the packaging is in French. Industrie und Gl\u00fcck type decks are not known to have a community of players in any French speaking country while the game of Minchiate is thought to have been restricted to only a few players in Genoa by the 1930s.\n\n==Game==\nMinchiate can be played by two to four players with the most common version played by four players divided into two partnerships.<ref name=\"History\" /> The game, like other tarot games, is a [[trick taking game]] in which points are scored by capturing certain cards and sets of cards. As in most tarot games, the pip cards in cups and coins are in reverse order and play is counter-clockwise. The lowest five trumps were called ''papi'' (\"popes\") while the highest five trumps (Star, Moon, Sun, World, Trumpets) were called ''arie'' (\"airs\") and have a special high scoring value in the game. Minchiate is similar in many ways to [[tarocchini]] played in [[Bologna]]. In these games, combinations ([[Meld (cards)|melds]]) of cards are more important than the value of individual cards.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n!'''Cards'''!!'''Points'''\n|-\n|Trumps 36-40||10\n|-\n|The Fool, Kings, and Trumps 1, 10, 13, 20, 28, (29), 30-35||5\n|-\n|Trumps 2-5||3\n|-\n|All others||0\n|}\n\nThe last trick is worth 10 points. Trump 29 is a unique card, by itself it is worth nothing but when used in combinations (''versicole''), it is worth 5 points. ''Versicole'' are formed through a sequence of three or more of consecutive point cards.  In addition, there are four irregular ''versicole'':\n\n*'''''Versicola del Matto''''': Trumps 1, 40, and the Fool\n*'''''Versicola del Tredici''''': Trumps 1, 13, and 28\n*'''''Versicola delle diecine''''': Trumps 10, 20, and 30; or 20, 30, and 40; or 10, 20, 30, and 40\n*'''''Versicola dei Regi''''': Three or four kings\n{{clear}}\nAll ''versicole'' have to be declared at the beginning of the game. At the end of the round, each team will assemble ''versicole'' from their captured tricks. Trumps 1, 3, 13, 20, 28, 30-33, and 38 are considered valuable cards because they are required to form some ''versicole'' or to deny the opposition the same. The Fool can be added to every ''versicola''.\n\nThe minchiate deck was also used to play two games that don't use normal tarot rules, ''Al Palio'' and ''A sei tocchi''.\n\n===2-player rules===\nThis is the simplest version of the game; it was not considered serious but only as an introduction to the more complex four player versions. [[Jeton]]s are used to keep track of scoring. The dealer gives 25 cards to his opponent and himself. His opponent leads the first trick but instead of letting the dealer play, she declares any meld she has and scores. The dealer then declares his melds and scores. Each takes back their own cards and the dealer finishes the first trick. Players must [[follow suit]]. If they are unable to do so, they must play a trump. If unable to play a trump, then any card can be discarded. The winner of each trick immediately scores from the captured cards and leads to the next trick.\n\nThe Fool excuses the player from following suit, it can neither capture nor be captured. The player gives a worthless card from his trick pile in exchange to his opponent.\n\nAt the end of the round, each player adds to their running total the captured cards, melds from the captured cards, and the last trick bonus. The player who has captured more than 25 cards gets a bonus point for each extra card. The two players then compare their sums with the loser having to pay the winner the difference.\n\n==In cartomancy==\nAlthough no divination system using this pack of cards ever existed in previous centuries, and because of this allegorical and cosmological content, in recent years tarot occultists have proposed systems of [[divination]] and [[cartomancy]] that use the minchiate deck. In [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s book 1890 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', an [[incantation]] is given that mentions the use of \"40 cards\", which are renamed in the spell as 40 [[deity|gods]] who are being invoked to compel the goddess [[Laverna]] to do the caster's bidding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/aradia/ara17.htm |title=Aradia, ch. 17 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>  [[Paul Huson]] has speculated that these 40 cards are the 40 trumps of the minchiate deck.<ref>Huson, Paul, ''The Devil's Picturebook'', p.67, New York: G.P.

It is no longer widely played. ''Minchiate'' can also refer to the special deck of 97 [[playing cards]] used in the game. The deck is closely related to the [[tarot]] cards, but contains an expanded suit of [[trump (card games)|trump]]s.  The game was similar to but more complex than [[tarocchi]]. The minchiate represents a Florentine variant on the original game.\n\n==History==\nFlorence is one of the contenders for the birthplace of tarot. The earliest reference to tarot cards, then known as [[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], is dated to 1440 when a notary in Florence recorded the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].<ref>Pratesi, Franco. [http://trionfi.com/giusto-giusti Studies on Giusto Giusti] at trionfi.com. Retrieved 3 March 2016.</ref>\n\nThe word ''minchiate'' comes from a dialect word meaning \"[[nonsense]]\" or \"trifle\", derived from ''mencla,'' the vulgar form of ''mentula'', a Latin word for \"phallus\"<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mario Alinei|title=L'etimologia di it.

The word ''minchione'' is attested in [[Italian language|Italian]] as meaning \"fool\", and ''minchionare'' means \"to laugh at\" someone.  The intended meaning may be \"the game of the fool\", considering that the card \"[[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]]\", also called \"The Excuse\", features prominently in the game play of all tarot games. In [[tarocchini]], ''sminchiate'' is a signal used to communicate to a teammate.\n[[File:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|left|Popess from the Rosenwald sheet.]]\nThe earliest reference to minchiate is found in a 1466 letter by [[Luigi Pulci]] to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. However, this game was believed to be played by a 78-card deck as evidenced by the Rosenwald sheets, uncut sheets of Florentine tarots dated from 1480 to 1500.<ref>[https://www.nga.gov/global-site-search-page.html?searchterm=tarocchi+woodcut Rosenwald sheets] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved 13 October 2017.</ref> There are two other differences from 97-card minchiate. First, in 97-card minchiate the sequence for some of the lower trumps goes from lowest to highest: [[Strength (Tarot card)|Fortitude]], [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], [[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel]], and [[Chariot (Tarot card)|Chariot]]. In the Rosenwald ordering it is Justice, Fortitude, Chariot, and Wheel. Second, the Rosenwald sheets contains the [[The High Priestess|Popess]] as the second trump which is not found in the 97-card deck. In a Florentine song written around 1500, the trumps in a tarot deck were listed as almost exactly as the Rosenwald sheets with the exception of the missing Popess which likely means that this card was dropped from the deck by that time.<ref name=\"Depaulis\">{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Early Italian Lists of Tarot Trumps|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=39\u201347}}</ref> The song also ranks the other trumps as Fortitude, Justice, Chariot, and Wheel, which suggests it is a transitional stage from the Rosenwald sheets to the 97-card deck's order.\n\n97-card minchiate was first known as ''germini'', after the Gemini (XXXV) card, the highest of the newly introduced trumps. The earliest record of germini dates to 1506.<ref name=\"Pratesi\">{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=1499-1506: Firenze|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2015|volume=44|issue=1|pages=61\u201371}}</ref> This deck was created by inserting the 20 new trumps as a single block between trump 15 and [[The Star (Tarot card)|The Star]], which is now trump 36. The new deck proved so much more popular that the 77-card deck ceased production and the older name of minchiate was transferred over to the larger deck during the 17th century. The game spread from Florence to the rest of Italy and France during that century. In [[Sicily]], it was called ''gallerini'' while in [[Liguria]] it was known as ''ganellini'' but the rules used in these regions are lost save for cryptic references that they were quite different from the Florentine game. All surviving rules are derived from the type played in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Papal States]].\n\nBy the 18th century, minchiate had overtaken the original game of tarot in popularity in Italy.  Paolo Minucci published a commentary on the game in 1676, and the game is described in detail by Romain Merlin in ''Origine des cartes \u00e0 jouer'', published in [[Paris]] in 1869. It was also known in Germany during the late 18th century. The game was still played in [[Genoa]] in the 1930s, but its popularity declined in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Deck==\n[[File:Vitoria - Bibat 019a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lucca]] version cards]]\nThe minchiate deck differs from other tarot decks in several features. The first and most obvious difference is that the trumps have almost doubled in number; there are 40 trumps in the minchiate, in addition to the unnumbered card the Madman, [[The Fool (tarot card)|The Fool]] or the excuse. Minchiate uses [[Roman numerals#Alternative forms|additive Roman numerals]] for its trumps. Due to the large number of trumps, players generally called them by their number with the exception of the ''arie''.\n\nMinchiate decks come in two standard patterns, earlier and later, which coexisted for almost two centuries. Earlier Minchiate dates from the early 16th century or even the late 15th century.<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-28.html Earlier Minchiate pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

Since the five lowest trumps were collectively known as the ''papi'' (popes), Love was added to this group after its demotion. The identification of middle ''papi'' was largely forgotten for centuries as players generally called cards by their number (pope 2, pope 3, etc.) French writer Romain Merlin (1869) is the only source that called trumps II, III, and IIII the Grand Duke, Western Emperor, and Eastern Emperor.\n\n[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], Fortitude, and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] were three classical \"[[cardinal virtues]]\" depicted in the more familiar tarot trumps. The minchiate supplies the remaining cardinal virtue&nbsp;\u2014 [[Prudence]]&nbsp;\u2014 and inserts them with the three [[theological virtues]], [[Faith]], [[Hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]].  The only other deck to have the theological virtues was the [[Visconti-Sforza tarot deck|Cary-Yale deck]]. This is the only deck to include all [[seven virtues]].\n\nMinchiate is a southern tarot pattern so it shares many qualities with the [[Tarocco Bolognese|Bolognese]] and [[Tarocco Siciliano|Sicilian tarots]] as opposed to the western patterns like the tarot of Marseilles. While the [[The Tower (Tarot card)|Tower]] is called The House of God in the Marseilles tarot, it is called the House of the Devil or Hellmouth in the minchiate deck  and it depicts a nude woman fleeing a burning building. The Moon depicts an [[astrology|astrologer]] studying the moon instead of the tarot of Marseilles howling dogs and lobster. The card corresponding to the Hermit is often called Time, or the Hunchback; it depicts an elderly man on crutches with an hourglass in the background. Like other southern decks, the final card in the series is not the World, but Judgement. The minchiate completes the series by adding all the [[zodiac]] signs (in random order) and the four [[classical element]]s.\n\nThe eight highest ranking trumps have a red background while the top five (the ''arie'') are unnumbered. A 98th card was made for some decks.<ref name=\"History\" /> It is a trump with a red background and is also unnumbered like the ''arie''. It depicts a nude woman running in a wheel, probably representing [[Fortuna]]. While 98-card decks were mentioned as being played in Sicily during the early 18th century, only a few examples from Genoa survive. It is uncertain how this card ranked and how it affected the versicole sequences in the game. Also unknown is how it relates to the 98-card version of the Minchiate Francesi described below.\n\n=== Educational Minchiate ===\nEducational decks were produced in Florence during the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|page=49}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Tarot, jeu et magie|date=1984|publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]|location=Paris|pages=85\u201386}}</ref> Instead of the usual figures and pips, each card would have text explaining a certain topic. One history deck has each suit teaching the history of Assyria, Persia, Greece, or Rome with the trumps teaching myths and legends. Geography decks contained maps of the known world.\n\n=== Minchiate Francesi ===\n[[File:Momus Tarot.jpg|thumb|Momus as the Fool in the 97-card deck]]\nThe '''Minchiate Francesi''', also called '''Minchiate de Poilly''' after its attribution to engraver [[Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly]] (1623\u201393) and his son (1666-1741) who had the same name, refer to 3 different French decks utilizing the same set of engravings. The first has 42 numbered trumps, the second has 40 numbered trumps and [[Momus]] as an unnumbered card and lacks the first's \"Le Chaos\" card, the third has 21 numbered trumps and Momus as an unnumbered card. The intended game for the first deck is unknown, but the second appears to be intended to be played like the Italian Minchiate while the third deck appears to be intended for ordinary Tarot (despite still being called a Minchiate deck). The order of the motifs for the two latter decks have been rearranged compared to the first deck to more closely resemble their Italian counterparts. All three decks have the same 56 plain suit cards with [[French playing cards|French suits]] with each suit representing a different continent; spades for Africa, hearts for Europe, clubs for the Americas, and diamonds for Asia. The engravings share motifs with both the Italian Minchiate and the [[Tarot Nouveau]] as well as taking unique motifs from [[Roman Mythology]].<ref>''Origine des cartes \u00e0 jouer'', Romain Merlin, Paris, 1869.

Like the 54-card [[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]] pattern, the plain suits consists of only 32 cards while the 40 trumps feature rustic [[genre scenes]]. With the ''Sk\u00fcs'' (the Fool), the total number of cards is 73. Compounding the mystery is that the packaging is in French. Industrie und Gl\u00fcck type decks are not known to have a community of players in any French speaking country while the game of Minchiate is thought to have been restricted to only a few players in Genoa by the 1930s.\n\n==Game==\nMinchiate can be played by two to four players with the most common version played by four players divided into two partnerships.<ref name=\"History\" /> The game, like other tarot games, is a [[trick taking game]] in which points are scored by capturing certain cards and sets of cards. As in most tarot games, the pip cards in cups and coins are in reverse order and play is counter-clockwise. The lowest five trumps were called ''papi'' (\"popes\") while the highest five trumps (Star, Moon, Sun, World, Trumpets) were called ''arie'' (\"airs\") and have a special high scoring value in the game. Minchiate is similar in many ways to [[tarocchini]] played in [[Bologna]]. In these games, combinations ([[Meld (cards)|melds]]) of cards are more important than the value of individual cards.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n!'''Cards'''!!'''Points'''\n|-\n|Trumps 36-40||10\n|-\n|The Fool, Kings, and Trumps 1, 10, 13, 20, 28, (29), 30-35||5\n|-\n|Trumps 2-5||3\n|-\n|All others||0\n|}\n\nThe last trick is worth 10 points. Trump 29 is a unique card, by itself it is worth nothing but when used in combinations (''versicole''), it is worth 5 points. ''Versicole'' are formed through a sequence of three or more of consecutive point cards.  In addition, there are four irregular ''versicole'':\n\n*'''''Versicola del Matto''''': Trumps 1, 40, and the Fool\n*'''''Versicola del Tredici''''': Trumps 1, 13, and 28\n*'''''Versicola delle diecine''''': Trumps 10, 20, and 30; or 20, 30, and 40; or 10, 20, 30, and 40\n*'''''Versicola dei Regi''''': Three or four kings\n{{clear}}\nAll ''versicole'' have to be declared at the beginning of the game. At the end of the round, each team will assemble ''versicole'' from their captured tricks. Trumps 1, 3, 13, 20, 28, 30-33, and 38 are considered valuable cards because they are required to form some ''versicole'' or to deny the opposition the same. The Fool can be added to every ''versicola''.\n\nThe minchiate deck was also used to play two games that don't use normal tarot rules, ''Al Palio'' and ''A sei tocchi''.\n\n===2-player rules===\nThis is the simplest version of the game; it was not considered serious but only as an introduction to the more complex four player versions. [[Jeton]]s are used to keep track of scoring. The dealer gives 25 cards to his opponent and himself. His opponent leads the first trick but instead of letting the dealer play, she declares any meld she has and scores. The dealer then declares his melds and scores. Each takes back their own cards and the dealer finishes the first trick. Players must [[follow suit]]. If they are unable to do so, they must play a trump. If unable to play a trump, then any card can be discarded. The winner of each trick immediately scores from the captured cards and leads to the next trick.\n\nThe Fool excuses the player from following suit, it can neither capture nor be captured. The player gives a worthless card from his trick pile in exchange to his opponent.\n\nAt the end of the round, each player adds to their running total the captured cards, melds from the captured cards, and the last trick bonus.

Affixing at the ceiling gives more stability, but is not always realized, especially at night clubs with higher ceilings or at transportable devices.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\">{{cite web |title=The Main Types of Dancing Poles - The Complete Dance Pole Guide |url=https://www.basicinvert78.com/main-types-dancing-poles/ |website=Basicinvert78 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> In most countries,<ref name=\"aerialamy\" /> including the United States, the diameter is usually 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;inches), or the now more popular 45&nbsp;mm (1.75 inches), allowing it to be gripped comfortably with one hand.

Dance poles may be permanent or portable, be different sizes, have spinning and/or static modes and they may have different coatings or be made from different materials.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" />\n\nDance poles that are permanent are fixed to the ceiling supported by a beam located in the roof and they are fixed to the floor by different brackets and bearings. Portable poles are attached to a base or a portable stage and do not need to be attached to the ceiling. These poles can easily be removed, dismantled and fit into cases for transport.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" />\n\nPoles come in a variety of diameters \u2013 50&nbsp;mm, 48&nbsp;mm, 45&nbsp;mm, 42&nbsp;mm, 40&nbsp;mm and 38&nbsp;mm.

In the spinning mode, the pole uses ball bearings to spin. This mode can be used to complete more experienced pole moves, make moves easier to complete and to add a more dramatic effect to the move. Most spinning poles can also be fixed to static mode in which the pole cannot rotate. The static mode is regularly used when pole dancing is first taught to beginners.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" />\n\nPoles come in a variety of materials and coatings, each of which possesses its own properties, advantages and disadvantages. The materials poles are made of are brass, titanium\u2013gold, stainless steel and chrome.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" /> The brass and titanium\u2013gold poles are gold in colour and are used to enhance the grip between the pole and the dancer, and are normally used by more advanced dancers.  The stainless steel poles are not as popular as the other types as they do not have the finest grip; however, they are used by dancers who have sensitive skin. The chrome poles are silver in colour and are most popular amongst beginners. The finishes some dance poles may possess are silicone sleeves and powder coatings. Silicone sleeves can provide maximum grip, although there are safety precautions dancers must consider before using silicone sleeves. These measures may include a great amount of clothing to be worn by the dancer, or performing only static moves. Poles that are coated in powder provide improved friction and grip for dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancepolesreviews.com/how-to-choose-the-right-dance-poles/|title=How To Choose The Right Dance Poles {{!}} Dance Poles Reviews|date=7 February 2012|newspaper=Dance Poles Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polemotion.com/pages/pole-dance-pole-buying-guide|title=Pole dance pole buying guide \u2013 Pole Motion|website=www.polemotion.com|access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nProducts such as chalk, \"Dry Hands\" or \"iTac\" may be used to help \"stick\" to the pole.

In the spinning mode, the pole uses ball bearings to spin. This mode can be used to complete more experienced pole moves, make moves easier to complete and to add a more dramatic effect to the move. Most spinning poles can also be fixed to static mode in which the pole cannot rotate. The static mode is regularly used when pole dancing is first taught to beginners.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" />\n\nPoles come in a variety of materials and coatings, each of which possesses its own properties, advantages and disadvantages. The materials poles are made of are brass, titanium\u2013gold, stainless steel and chrome.<ref name=\"basicinvert78\" /> The brass and titanium\u2013gold poles are gold in colour and are used to enhance the grip between the pole and the dancer, and are normally used by more advanced dancers.  The stainless steel poles are not as popular as the other types as they do not have the finest grip; however, they are used by dancers who have sensitive skin. The chrome poles are silver in colour and are most popular amongst beginners. The finishes some dance poles may possess are silicone sleeves and powder coatings. Silicone sleeves can provide maximum grip, although there are safety precautions dancers must consider before using silicone sleeves. These measures may include a great amount of clothing to be worn by the dancer, or performing only static moves. Poles that are coated in powder provide improved friction and grip for dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancepolesreviews.com/how-to-choose-the-right-dance-poles/|title=How To Choose The Right Dance Poles {{!}} Dance Poles Reviews|date=7 February 2012|newspaper=Dance Poles Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polemotion.com/pages/pole-dance-pole-buying-guide|title=Pole dance pole buying guide \u2013 Pole Motion|website=www.polemotion.com|access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nProducts such as chalk, \"Dry Hands\" or \"iTac\" may be used to help \"stick\" to the pole.
