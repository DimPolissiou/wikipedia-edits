It was the first season for first-time head coach [[Tony Dungy]].\n\nThe 1996 Buccaneers season would be a turning point for the franchise, as the team began to acquire the personnel that would lead it into its most successful era.\n\nThe 1996 season also marked the debut year the team wore stitched up authentic name and numbers on jersey and the final year the Buccaneers wore their trademark orange and white uniforms.\n\n==Offseason==\nPrior to the season the Buccaneers were still unsure if the team would remain in [[Tampa Bay]] or if it would be moved by new ownership family led by [[Malcolm Glazer]] and sons, either to [[Cleveland]],<ref>\"NFL teams shift into move groove: Owners to vote Feb. 8\u20139 on Browns\"; in ''[[The Washington Times]]''; January 19, 1996; p.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/18/sports/pro-football-vote-is-delayed-on-browns-relocation.html \u201cPro Football: Vote Is Delayed on Browns\u2019 Relocation\u201d]; in ''[[The New York Times]]''; January 18, 1996</ref> Los Angeles,<ref>\"NFL's Games of Musical Chairs Making Football Fans Fell Dizzy\"; in ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', July 1, 1995; p. 1D</ref><ref>\"NFL Owners Spared Tough Agenda Today\"; in ''[[Charlotte Observer]]''; May 21, 1996</ref> or the nearby city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].<ref>\"No. 1 NFL Rule on Relocation Is That There Are No Rules\"; in ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''; November 12, 1995; p. 03F</ref> Eventually, the team's future was determined by a local referendum, which approved funding for a new stadium for [[1998 NFL season|the 1998 season]].\n\nRule changes earlier in the decade brought about a salary cap, and a minimum spending cap forced Bucs to spend more on players. With the new ownership, tax disclosures showed the old Culverhouse regime was running a \"for-profit\" business in which players who were getting good were released before their contracts could get big, all the while claiming poor and trying to get some home games played in Orlando.\n\n===NFL Draft===\nPrior to the 1996 season the team drafted fullback [[Mike Alstott]], who became one of the most popular players in the team's history, as well as defensive back [[Donnie Abraham]]. Although Alstott would become one of the Buccaneers\u2019 most popular players of all time, the organization did not target him in the draft: the team had originally wanted tailback [[Leeland McElroy]], who would be taken before the Bucs drafted.\n\n{|\n|-\n|style=\"background:#fc0; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|= [[Pro Bowl]]er <ref name=\"Pro Bowler note\">Players are identified as a Pro Bowler if they were selected for the Pro-Bowl at any time in their career.</ref>\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#de6108; color:#fff; border:2px solid #b20032;\"\n|style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Pick''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Round''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Player''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Position''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''School'''\n|-\n|align=center|12||1||[[Regan Upshaw]]||Defensive End||[[California Golden Bears football|California]]\n|-\n|align=center|22||1||[[Marcus Jones (athlete)|Marcus Jones]]||Defensive End||[[North Carolina Tarheels football|North Carolina]]\n|-\n|align=center|35||2|| style=\"background:#fc0;\"|[[Mike Alstott]]||Fullback||[[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]]\n|-\n|align=center|71||3|| style=\"background:#fc0;\"|[[Donnie Abraham]]||Defensive Back||[[East Tennessee State University|ETSU]]\n|-\n|align=center|96||4||[[Jason Odom]]||Offensive Tackle||[[Florida Gators football|Florida]]\n|-\n|align=center|104||4||Eric Austin||Defensive Back||[[Jackson State Tigers#Football|Jackson State]]\n|-\n|align=center|140||5||[[Jason Maniecki]]||Defensive Tackle||[[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]]\n|-\n|align=center|180||6||Nilo Silvan||Wide Receiver||[[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n|-\n|align=center|221||7||[[Reggie Rusk]]||Defensive Back||[[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]\n|}\n\n===Undrafted free agents===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1996 Undrafted Free Agents of note\n!Player\n!Position\n!College\n|-\n|[[Scott Milanovich]]\n|Quarterback\n|[[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]]\n|}\n\n==Season Summary==\nDespite having been 7\u20137 toward the end of 1995, the 1996 team went 0\u20135 before getting their first win over Tony Dungy's former team, [[1996 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]]. The 24\u201313 win over Minnesota started another streak few noted at the time, in which the team held opponents to 13 points or less in four consecutive games. Despite this, [[1996 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] came to Tampa Bay in Week Eleven facing a 1\u20138 Buccaneers team. Tampa Bay defeated Oakland 20\u201317 in overtime, which was the first of five wins over the next seven games.\n\nThe following week, Tampa Bay traveled to the west coast, where they historically had trouble winning. Playing an interconference game at [[1996 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]], Tampa Bay quickly found themselves down 14\u20130. The morning of the game, [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] were in their hotel room watching [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]''. [[Chris Berman]] referred to the game as the \"Superchargers\" versus the \"Yucs\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2004-03-22/sports/0403220144_1_mike-dupue-sapp-and-linebacker-tampa-bay-buccaneers-history |title=Sapp Earned Tampa Fans' Shrugs|publisher=Daily Press|first=Mike|last=Bianchi|date=2004-03-22|accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref><ref>\"Relentless: the Road to Canton \u2013 Warren Sapp\": NFL Network</ref> \u2013 a derogatory nickname that had stemmed from the Bucs many years of futility.

It was the first season for first-time head coach [[Tony Dungy]].\n\nThe 1996 Buccaneers season would be a turning point for the franchise, as the team began to acquire the personnel that would lead it into its most successful era.\n\nThe 1996 season also marked the debut year the team wore stitched up authentic name and numbers on jersey and the final year the Buccaneers wore their trademark orange and white uniforms.\n\n==Offseason==\nPrior to the season the Buccaneers were still unsure if the team would remain in [[Tampa Bay]] or if it would be moved by new ownership family led by [[Malcolm Glazer]] and sons, either to [[Cleveland]],<ref>\"NFL teams shift into move groove: Owners to vote Feb. 8\u20139 on Browns\"; in ''[[The Washington Times]]''; January 19, 1996; p.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/18/sports/pro-football-vote-is-delayed-on-browns-relocation.html \u201cPro Football: Vote Is Delayed on Browns\u2019 Relocation\u201d]; in ''[[The New York Times]]''; January 18, 1996</ref> Los Angeles,<ref>\"NFL's Games of Musical Chairs Making Football Fans Fell Dizzy\"; in ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', July 1, 1995; p. 1D</ref><ref>\"NFL Owners Spared Tough Agenda Today\"; in ''[[Charlotte Observer]]''; May 21, 1996</ref> or the nearby city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].<ref>\"No. 1 NFL Rule on Relocation Is That There Are No Rules\"; in ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''; November 12, 1995; p. 03F</ref> Eventually, the team's future was determined by a local referendum, which approved funding for a new stadium for [[1998 NFL season|the 1998 season]].\n\nRule changes earlier in the decade brought about a salary cap, and a minimum spending cap forced Bucs to spend more on players. With the new ownership, tax disclosures showed the old Culverhouse regime was running a \"for-profit\" business in which players who were getting good were released before their contracts could get big, all the while claiming poor and trying to get some home games played in Orlando.\n\n===NFL Draft===\nPrior to the 1996 season the team drafted fullback [[Mike Alstott]], who became one of the most popular players in the teams history, as well as defensive back [[Donnie Abraham]]. Although Alstott would become one of the Buccaneers\u2019 most popular players of all time, the organization did not target him in the draft: the team had originally wanted tailback [[Leeland McElroy]], who would be taken before the Bucs drafted.\n\n{|\n|-\n|style=\"background:#fc0; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|= [[Pro Bowl]]er <ref name=\"Pro Bowler note\">Players are identified as a Pro Bowler if they were selected for the Pro-Bowl at any time in their career.</ref>\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#de6108; color:#fff; border:2px solid #b20032;\"\n|style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Pick''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Round''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Player''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''Position''' ||style=\"border: 2px solid #b20032;\"| '''School'''\n|-\n|align=center|12||1||[[Regan Upshaw]]||Defensive End||[[California Golden Bears football|California]]\n|-\n|align=center|22||1||[[Marcus Jones (athlete)|Marcus Jones]]||Defensive End||[[North Carolina Tarheels football|North Carolina]]\n|-\n|align=center|35||2|| style=\"background:#fc0;\"|[[Mike Alstott]]||Fullback||[[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]]\n|-\n|align=center|71||3|| style=\"background:#fc0;\"|[[Donnie Abraham]]||Defensive Back||[[East Tennessee State University|ETSU]]\n|-\n|align=center|96||4||[[Jason Odom]]||Offensive Tackle||[[Florida Gators football|Florida]]\n|-\n|align=center|104||4||Eric Austin||Defensive Back||[[Jackson State Tigers#Football|Jackson State]]\n|-\n|align=center|140||5||[[Jason Maniecki]]||Defensive Tackle||[[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]]\n|-\n|align=center|180||6||Nilo Silvan||Wide Receiver||[[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n|-\n|align=center|221||7||[[Reggie Rusk]]||Defensive Back||[[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]\n|}\n\n===Undrafted free agents===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1996 Undrafted Free Agents of note\n!Player\n!Position\n!College\n|-\n|[[Scott Milanovich]]\n|Quarterback\n|[[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]]\n|}\n\n==Season Summary==\nDespite having been 7\u20137 toward the end of 1995, the 1996 team went 0\u20135 before getting their first win over Tony Dungy's former team, [[1996 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]]. The 24\u201313 win over Minnesota started another streak few noted at the time, in which the team held opponents to 13 points or less in four consecutive games. Despite this, [[1996 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] came to Tampa Bay in Week Eleven facing a 1\u20138 Buccaneers team. Tampa Bay defeated Oakland 20\u201317 in overtime, which was the first of five wins over the next seven games.\n\nThe following week, Tampa Bay traveled to the west coast, where they historically had trouble winning. Playing an interconference game at [[1996 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]], Tampa Bay quickly found themselves down 14\u20130.

Opened in the last decade of the nineteenth century, it was part of a drive by the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) to develop holiday traffic to Cornwall. The LSWR had opened a line connecting Exeter with Holsworthy in 1879,<ref name=\"semmens\">{{cite book| last=Semmens | first =Peter | title=The Withered Arm: the Southern West of Exeter | publisher=Ian Allan| location=Weybridge | year=1988 | isbn=0 7110 1806 5 }}</ref> and by encouraging the North Cornwall Railway it planned to create railway access to previously inaccessible parts of the northern coastal area.\n\n\"There are few more fascinating lines than the one which leads to North Cornwall from Okehampton\"<ref name=\"roche\">{{cite book| last=Roche | first =T.W.E. | title=The Withered Arm: Reminiscences of the Southern Lines West of Exeter | publisher=Forge Books| location=Bracknell  | edition=new | year=1977}}</ref> says T.W.E. Roche in his popular tribute to the network of railway lines operated by the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) in North and West Devon and [[North Cornwall]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First railways===\n{{North Cornwall Railway RDT}}\nIn the nineteenth century, Padstow was an important fishing port, but it was hampered by lack of land communication with its markets. The [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]] opened in 1834, but it limited its horizons to connecting the harbour at Wadebridge to the immediate hinterland.\n\nTrunk railway connection reached Cornwall with the opening of the [[Cornwall Railway]] in 1859, allied with the associated companies which formed the alliance led by the [[Great Western Railway]], whose lines used the [[broad gauge]]. The Cornwall Railway ran east to west in the southern part of the county, and it had exhausted its financial resources in building its line through the difficult terrain. The struggle to achieve dominance in Cornwall had been fierce and the rival [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) had the intention of having a line in the county; in 1847 it had purchased the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway,<ref name = awdry>{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Awdry| title=Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies| publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited| location=Wellingborough| year=1990| isbn=1 85260 049 7}}</ref><ref name = wilson/> at a time when the nearest section of its own network was at Bishopstoke (Eastleigh). Finding the necessity of concentrating its resources further east, it had been unable to make progress towards connecting Cornwall into its system.\n\n===The LSWR reaches Devon===\nThrough the medium of nominally independent local companies, the LSWR had reached Lidford (now spelt Lydford) in Devon in 1874, giving it access to Plymouth over the [[South Devon Railway Company|South Devon Railway]], and in 1879 it built a branch from Meldon Junction, west of Okehampton, to Holsworthy in north west Devon.\n\nNow the LSWR had the opportunity to enter Cornwall, and to connect with its isolated Bodmin and Wadebridge line. A North Cornwall Railway company, supported by the LSWR, was formed to develop the northern part of the Cornish peninsula; its line was to leave the Holsworthy line (which was later extended to become the [[Okehampton to Bude Line]]) at [[Halwill]] and continue through [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] to Wadebridge. The prospectus of the North Cornwall company indicated that a further extension of {{convert|24|mi}} would be required to bring the railway from Wadebridge to the county town of [[Truro]].\n\n===Opening in stages===\nThe North Cornwall Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 18 August 1882, but money was scarce and construction was slow, so it was not until 21 July 1886 that the first section opened, and the line was completed in 1899. (In fact to facilitate raising capital, the Company was segmented into several sections for financial purposes; the total authorised capital was \u00a3660,000 with borrowing powers of \u00a3220,000.)<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref> The LSWR was to work the line for 55% of gross receipts.<ref name = williams>{{cite book| first=R.A.| last=Williams| title=The London & South Western Railway| volume=Vol 2| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1973| isbn=0 7153 5940 1}}</ref>\n\nThe line was opened in stages:\n\n* Halwill to Launceston; {{miles-chains|14|mi|57|chain|km}}; 21 July 1886\n* Launceston to Tresmeer; {{miles-chains|7|mi|75|chain|km}}; 28 July 1892<ref group = note>Wilson says 21 July 1892.</ref>\n* Tresmeer to Camelford; {{miles-chains|9|mi|26|chain|km}}; 14 August 1893\n* Camelford to Delabole; {{miles-chains|2|mi|29|chain|km}}; 18 October 1893\n* Delabole to Wadebridge; {{miles-chains|10|mi|68|chain|km}}; 1 June 1895\n* Wadebridge to Padstow; {{miles-chains|5|mi|52|chain|km}}; 27 March 1899.<ref name = wilson/><ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book| last=St John Thomas | first =David (editor) | title=Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain; Volume 1: the West Country | publisher=David & Charles | location=Newton Abbot | edition=3rd | year=1966 }}</ref>\n\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) already had a station at Launceston, opened in 1865, and the North Cornwall Railway station was built adjacent to it. At Wadebridge, the line joined with the Bodmin and Wadebridge line; the original station had been expanded when the GWR line from Bodmin was opened in 1888.\n\n===Commercial potential===\nThe fishing activity at Padstow had long been declining, and the LSWR had hopes of reviving it. Their wishes were realised and a substantial increase of fish tonnage carried was experienced over the first years; a special connection to the fish quay had been provided. Tourist and holiday passenger traffic was also sought, as by the end of the nineteenth century this business was well established at comparable locations. There was a large slate quarry at Delabole, at the time said to be the largest man-made excavation in the world<ref name = wilson/> and considerable traffic was derived from that.\n\nHowever apart from Launceston and Wadebridge the very long single-track line served only small rural communities, and never achieved the importance that its promoters had hoped for. Fish traffic and ice for the ships<ref name=\"thomas\"/> were always important commodities on the line, as was the seasonal holidaymaker traffic for Padstow and several resorts served indirectly by the railway.\n\n===Takeover by the LSWR===\nWorked throughout its existence by the LSWR, the North Cornwall Line was dependent on the larger company, and in 1894 terms were agreed for a sale to the LSWR:\n\n===On to Penzance?===\nIn 1894, with rapid progress being made in building the line, a parliamentary notice was issued for a line from Padstow to Newquay and Truro, and from there with running powers over the GWR to Falmouth and Penzance.<ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite journal| last=Wilson| first=B.G.| title=The North Cornwall Line of the Southern Region| magazine=The Railway Magazine| volume=95 |date=September\u2013October 1949| pages=326\u2013329| url=http://www.semgonline.com/RlyMag/NorthCornwallLine.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=29 October 2008| issue=583}}</ref> However this was an aspiration for which there was no possibility of raising the necessary finance,<ref name = williams279>Williams, page 279</ref> and the proposal came to nothing, but the GWR were concerned at this planned penetration, and it is said<ref name = wilson/> that this prompted the scheme to build a line from Truro to Newquay. This became the [[Atlantic Coast Line, Cornwall|Atlantic Coast Line]], which links the GWR mainline at [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] to Newquay.  In 1905 powers were granted to provide a line to Newquay diverging in the vicinity of Bodmin Road. Proposals for light railways in the country between Padstow and Newquay continued until 1911, but none came to anything.\n\n===Padstow harbour improvements===\nIn 1911 a scheme was developed to improve the fishing harbour arrangements at Padstow; this was supported by the government and the LSWR; the Company alone spent \u00a310,350 on the dock wall and sidings and sheds, and took up \u00a330,000 of the Harbour Commissioners' bonds. The work was completed by 1920, by which time the LSWR was the dominant partner in the operation of the harbour.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\n===Financial reconstruction===\nThe building of the North Cornwall Line had been undertaken by four different financial entities for reasons of raising finance at a difficult time. In 1912 the LSWR chairman, Herbert Walker, proposed a capital reconstruction under which a single North Cornwall Railway Leased Line stock would be created from the four subsidiaries; \u00a3825,000 of capital was transferred in this way, the arrangement receiving Parliamentary authority on 15 August 1913.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\n===Grouping of the railways, and nationalisation===\nUnder the terms of the [[Railways Act 1921]], the railway companies of Great Britain were to be amalgamated into four \"groups\"; the new Southern group was to include the LSWR (as a \"constituent\"), and the North Cornwall Railway was to be absorbed: the Company was still in existence as an entity although the line was worked as an intrinsic part of the LSWR. This process of \"grouping\" took practical effect at the beginning of 1923, although a number of technical requirements resulted in the official transfer dates varying.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Transport Act 1947]] the railways of Great Britain passed into national ownership at the beginning of 1948.\n\n==Closure==\nThroughout its existence the North Cornwall line had operated against the odds, its long line serving sparsely populated and relatively unproductive terrain. As the costs of unproductive railway operation came into focus following the [[Beeching Report]], the line had only its romantic appeal to offer, with even the highly seasonal summer holiday traffic falling away in the face of road transport and more attractive destinations. It closed on 3 October 1966, the Wadebridge to Padstow section continuing to be served by Bodmin trains until it too closed on 28 January 1967.<ref name = vaughan/>\n\n==Train services==\nThe thin population meant that little intermediate traffic was generated, and a passenger service of four or five daily trains was operated almost throughout the life of the line.\n\nThe route between Launceston and Padstow was not designed for speed. The single line route required several sections at a gradient of 1 in 73 to allow for the rise from near Sea Level at Padstow to a summit at 860 feet above Sea Level between Camelford and Otterham and the line constantly curved, typically with a radius of 30 chains, in order to follow the contours and avoid costly earthworks. The result was a typical journey from Halwill to Padstow that occupied 90 to 100 minutes down and up to 110 minutes in the up direction. These times were reduced over the years with more powerful locomotives so that by the 1940s journey times between Launceston and Padstow were typically 80 minutes in the down direction and 90 minutes in the up. The maximum speed permitted on the North Cornwall line was 55&nbsp;mph.<ref name = Wroe>{{cite book|last=Wroe|first=David.|title=An Illustrated History of the North Cornwall Railway|date=1995|publisher=Irwell Press|location=Caernarfon|isbn=1 871608 63 5}}</ref>\n\nThe 1938 ''Bradshaw's Railway Guide''<ref>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's Railway Guide for July 1938| edition=1968 reprint| publisher=David and Charles| location=Newton Abbot}}</ref> shows five down and six up trains a day (Monday to Friday) on the line, plus a first up train from Launceston to Halwill and a last up train from Padstow to Launceston, and a last down train from Halwill to Launceston. All the trains called at all stations with the exception of the [[Atlantic Coast Express]], the 11:00 from Waterloo, which ran non-stop Exeter St Davids to Halwill, then Launceston, Otterham, Camelford, Delabole, Port Isaac Road and Wadebridge, arriving in Padstow at 4:24 after a {{convert|260|mi|km|adj=on}} journey. The train conveyed a restaurant car throughout. The Saturday service was similar, although congestion earlier in the journey meant a slightly slower journey. There was no Sunday service.\n\nTender engines were preferred on the line, the Adams Jubilee class being dominant at first, supplanted by the T9 class 4-4-0 being dominant in the Edwardian era. Until the mid-1940s the weight restriction over [[Meldon Viaduct]] and the short turntable at Padstow prevented anything larger than the Southern Railway mixed traffic 2-6-0 types from working over the line.

However Southern National omnibus connections gave journey options: Tintagel and Boscastle had good connections from Camelford, Newquay from Wadebridge, and [[Bedruthan]] and [[Trevone]] Bay from Padstow.

In the late 1920s responsibility for the station was passed to the Stationmaster at Otterham, and in 1930 the block instruments were moved from the signalbox to the Booking Office under the charge of a porter-signalman.

A single siding behind the down platform gave access to a goods shed and loading dock; goods facilities officially ceased in September 1964 although the line to the loading dock had been removed three months earlier. The siding and passing loop were officially taken out of use on 14 November 1964, with the station becoming unstaffed on 6 January 1965. The station closed on 3 October 1966.

A footpath linked the station with the village, which was more than a mile away: by road the distance was {{convert|2|mi|km}}. [[Otterham Station]] was also the name of a hamlet which grew up near the station.\n\nThe down platform was provided with a waiting shelter while the station building and signal box were on the up platform; all three were built of local stone. A single siding on the up side provided access to a loading dock, but there was no goods shed. A second siding parallel to the first was added later. In 1928 Otterham returned the lowest ticket sales on the line. Following the withdrawal of goods facilities on the line on 7 September 1964, the passing loop, sidings, and signal box were officially taken out of use on 7 February 1965, and the trackwork was removed that October.

Like the waiting shelter on the down platform, the buildings were constructed from local stone. As elsewhere on the line, no footbridge was provided. Cattle pens were provided on the single siding, with the goods shed on a loop between the siding and headshunt.\n\nThe station opened on 14 August 1893, with station signs proclaiming \"[[Camelford]] for [[Boscastle]] and [[Tintagel]]\". Camelford was the busiest intermediate station between Launceston and Wadebridge, but the distance from the town kept the passenger numbers low: in 1928 there was an average of just over 20 tickets issued daily, with 35 collected, and this number steadily declining with improved road transport. No alterations were made to the station layout throughout its life; the sidings were officially taken out of use on 30 November 1965 after the end of goods traffic the previous year, but the signal box and passing loop remained operational until closure on 3 October 1966.\n\nThe small settlement of Camelford Station grew up around the railway and the station site was for a time occupied by the British Cycling Museum (subsequently closed). More information about the area can be found in the article on [[Slaughterbridge]]. The station is now a private residence.\n\n'''Delabole'''; The adjacent Delabole Slate quarry, [[Delabole]] station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.6226|-4.7268|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Delabole station}})}} resulted in considerable outwards mineral traffic. The station opened on 18 October 1893 after the slate company donated 1.5 miles of trackbed free to the LSWR. It was equipped with a passing loop and two platforms. A single siding was provided behind the up platform, which was where the signal box was sited. On the down side the platform had the station building and a short loading dock with the goods shed on a further siding running behind the platform. A single road through engine shed was provided, with a turntable beyond between the goods shed and a line extending to the quarry. There was a considerable narrow gauge tramway network within the quarry, in existence  before the construction of the North Cornwall line. There had earlier been a three-foot gauge network with a four track incline, but by 1879 this had been converted to a 2-feet gauge system with a six-track incline.<ref name = bodman>{{cite book| first=Martin| last=Bodman| title=Inclined Planes in the South West| publisher=Twelveheads Press| location=Truro| year=2012| isbn=978 0 906294 75 8}}</ref>\n\nAs it was situated in the village itself, the station was better used than many on the route, and the proximity of the quarry ensured that freight receipts remained healthy. Goods services were withdrawn on 7 September 1964 and the loading dock was removed; the siding on the down side had been removed some time previously. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The station building is now in use as a private residence, and houses have been built on the site of the up platform.\n\n'''{{visible anchor|Port Isaac Road}}'''; the station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.5764|-4.7703|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Port Isaac Road station}})}} was three miles (5&nbsp;km) from [[Port Isaac]] itself, and opened on 1 June 1895, and had a passing loop and a single siding with headshunt that served a goods shed and loading dock. All buildings were of local stone; the station building and signal box locking room were on the up platform, the small waiting shelter on the down platform, and the goods shed. Ticket sales were low, with nearly 4500 annually in 1928, this dropping to under 2000 in 1936; freight dropped in a similar way over the same period. The station layout never changed; the station siding was taken out of use in December 1965. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966.

Both lines through the station had platforms although the down platform had no buildings and was only accessible via a foot crossing at the down end of the station. The station building itself, like the goods shed, was substantially constructed out of local stone, as was the locking room of the signal box. The passing loop was extended in 1939, but the up loop, sidings and signal box were taken out of use on 21 November 1965 as goods services had ceased on 7 September the previous year. Traffic was never very heavy and by the late 1930s was averaging 5 passengers per day, less than a third of that ten years earlier.

Opened in the last decade of the nineteenth century, it was part of a drive by the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) to develop holiday traffic to Cornwall. The LSWR had opened a line connecting Exeter with Holsworthy in 1879,<ref name=\"semmens\">{{cite book| last=Semmens | first =Peter | title=The Withered Arm: the Southern West of Exeter | publisher=Ian Allan| location=Weybridge | year=1988 | isbn=0 7110 1806 5 }}</ref> and by encouraging the North Cornwall Railway it planned to create railway access to previously inaccessible parts of the northern coastal area.\n\n\"There are few more fascinating lines than the one which leads to North Cornwall from Okehampton\"<ref name=\"roche\">{{cite book| last=Roche | first =T.W.E. | title=The Withered Arm: Reminiscences of the Southern Lines West of Exeter | publisher=Forge Books| location=Bracknell  | edition=new | year=1977}}</ref> says T.W.E. Roche in his popular tribute to the network of railway lines operated by the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) in North and West Devon and [[North Cornwall]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First railways===\n{{North Cornwall Railway RDT}}\nIn the nineteenth century, Padstow was an important fishing port, but it was hampered by lack of land communication with its markets. The [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]] opened in 1834, but it limited its horizons to connecting the harbour at Wadebridge to the immediate hinterland.\n\nTrunk railway connection reached Cornwall with the opening of the [[Cornwall Railway]] in 1859, allied with the associated companies which formed the alliance led by the [[Great Western Railway]], whose lines used the [[broad gauge]]. The Cornwall Railway ran east to west in the southern part of the county, and it had exhausted its financial resources in building its line through the difficult terrain. The struggle to achieve dominance in Cornwall had been fierce and the rival [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) had the intention of having a line in the county; in 1847 it had purchased the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway,<ref name = awdry>{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Awdry| title=Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies| publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited| location=Wellingborough| year=1990| isbn=1 85260 049 7}}</ref><ref name = wilson/> at a time when the nearest section of its own network was at Bishopstoke (Eastleigh). Finding the necessity of concentrating its resources further east, it had been unable to make progress towards connecting Cornwall into its system.\n\n===The LSWR reaches Devon===\nThrough the medium of nominally independent local companies, the LSWR had reached Lidford (now spelt Lydford) in Devon in 1874, giving it access to Plymouth over the [[South Devon Railway Company|South Devon Railway]], and in 1879 it built a branch from Meldon Junction, west of Okehampton, to Holsworthy in north west Devon.\n\nNow the LSWR had the opportunity to enter Cornwall, and to connect with its isolated Bodmin and Wadebridge line. A North Cornwall Railway company, supported by the LSWR, was formed to develop the northern part of the Cornish peninsula; its line was to leave the Holsworthy line (which was later extended to become the [[Okehampton to Bude Line]]) at [[Halwill]] and continue through [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] to Wadebridge. The prospectus of the North Cornwall company indicated that a further extension of {{convert|24|mi}} would be required to bring the railway from Wadebridge to the county town of [[Truro]].\n\n===Opening in stages===\nThe North Cornwall Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 18 August 1882, but money was scarce and construction was slow, so it was not until 21 July 1886 that the first section opened, and the line was completed in 1899. (In fact to facilitate raising capital, the Company was segmented into several sections for financial purposes; the total authorised capital was \u00a3660,000 with borrowing powers of \u00a3220,000.)<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref> The LSWR was to work the line for 55% of gross receipts.<ref name = williams>{{cite book| first=R.A.| last=Williams| title=The London & South Western Railway| volume=Vol 2| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1973| isbn=0 7153 5940 1}}</ref>\n\nThe line was opened in stages:\n\n* Halwill to Launceston; {{miles-chains|14|mi|57|chain|km}}; 21 July 1886\n* Launceston to Tresmeer; {{miles-chains|7|mi|75|chain|km}}; 28 July 1892<ref group = note>Wilson says 21 July 1892.</ref>\n* Tresmeer to Camelford; {{miles-chains|9|mi|26|chain|km}}; 14 August 1893\n* Camelford to Delabole; {{miles-chains|2|mi|29|chain|km}}; 18 October 1893\n* Delabole to Wadebridge; {{miles-chains|10|mi|68|chain|km}}; 1 June 1895\n* Wadebridge to Padstow; {{miles-chains|5|mi|52|chain|km}}; 27 March 1899.<ref name = wilson/><ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book| last=St John Thomas | first =David (editor) | title=Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain; Volume 1: the West Country | publisher=David & Charles | location=Newton Abbot | edition=3rd | year=1966 }}</ref>\n\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) already had a station at Launceston, opened in 1865, and the North Cornwall Railway station was built adjacent to it. At Wadebridge, the line joined with the Bodmin and Wadebridge line; the original station had been expanded when the GWR line from Bodmin was opened in 1888.\n\n===Commercial potential===\nThe fishing activity at Padstow had long been declining, and the LSWR had hopes of reviving it. Their wishes were realised and a substantial increase of fish tonnage carried was experienced over the first years; a special connection to the fish quay had been provided. Tourist and holiday passenger traffic was also sought, as by the end of the nineteenth century this business was well established at comparable locations. There was a large slate quarry at Delabole, at the time said to be the largest man-made excavation in the world<ref name = wilson/> and considerable traffic was derived from that.\n\nHowever apart from Launceston and Wadebridge the very long single-track line served only small rural communities, and never achieved the importance that its promoters had hoped for. Fish traffic and ice for the ships<ref name=\"thomas\"/> were always important commodities on the line, as was the seasonal holidaymaker traffic for Padstow and several resorts served indirectly by the railway.\n\n===Takeover by the LSWR===\nWorked throughout its existence by the LSWR, the North Cornwall Line was dependent on the larger company, and in 1894 terms were agreed for a sale to the LSWR:\n\n===On to Penzance?===\nIn 1894, with rapid progress being made in building the line, a parliamentary notice was issued for a line from Padstow to Newquay and Truro, and from there with running powers over the GWR to Falmouth and Penzance.<ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite journal| last=Wilson| first=B.G.| title=The North Cornwall Line of the Southern Region| magazine=The Railway Magazine| volume=95 |date=September\u2013October 1949| pages=326\u2013329| url=http://www.semgonline.com/RlyMag/NorthCornwallLine.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=29 October 2008| issue=583}}</ref> However this was an aspiration for which there was no possibility of raising the necessary finance,<ref name = williams279>Williams, page 279</ref> and the proposal came to nothing, but the GWR were concerned at this planned penetration, and it is said<ref name = wilson/> that this prompted the scheme to build a line from Truro to Newquay. This became the [[Atlantic Coast Line, Cornwall|Atlantic Coast Line]], which links the GWR mainline at [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] to Newquay.  In 1905 powers were granted to provide a line to Newquay diverging in the vicinity of Bodmin Road. Proposals for light railways in the country between Padstow and Newquay continued until 1911, but none came to anything.\n\n===Padstow harbour improvements===\nIn 1911 a scheme was developed to improve the fishing harbour arrangements at Padstow; this was supported by the government and the LSWR; the Company alone spent \u00a310,350 on the dock wall and sidings and sheds, and took up \u00a330,000 of the Harbour Commissioners' bonds. The work was completed by 1920, by which time the LSWR was the dominant partner in the operation of the harbour.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\n===Financial reconstruction===\nThe building of the North Cornwall Line had been undertaken by four different financial entities for reasons of raising finance at a difficult time. In 1912 the LSWR chairman, Herbert Walker, proposed a capital reconstruction under which a single North Cornwall Railway Leased Line stock would be created from the four subsidiaries; \u00a3825,000 of capital was transferred in this way, the arrangement receiving Parliamentary authority on 15 August 1913.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\n===Grouping of the railways, and nationalisation===\nUnder the terms of the [[Railways Act 1921]], the railway companies of Great Britain were to be amalgamated into four \"groups\"; the new Southern group was to include the LSWR (as a \"constituent\"), and the North Cornwall Railway was to be absorbed: the Company was still in existence as an entity although the line was worked as an intrinsic part of the LSWR. This process of \"grouping\" took practical effect at the beginning of 1923, although a number of technical requirements resulted in the official transfer dates varying.<ref name = faulkner/>\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Transport Act 1947]] the railways of Great Britain passed into national ownership at the beginning of 1948.\n\n==Closure==\nThroughout its existence the North Cornwall line had operated against the odds, its long line serving sparsely populated and relatively unproductive terrain. As the costs of unproductive railway operation came into focus following the [[Beeching Report]], the line had only its romantic appeal to offer, with even the highly seasonal summer holiday traffic falling away in the face of road transport and more attractive destinations. It closed on 3 October 1966, the Wadebridge to Padstow section continuing to be served by Bodmin trains until it too closed on 28 January 1967.<ref name = vaughan/>\n\n==Train services==\nThe thin population meant that little intermediate traffic was generated, and a passenger service of four or five daily trains was operated almost throughout the life of the line.\n\nThe route between Launceston and Padstow was not designed for speed. The single line route required several sections at a gradient of 1 in 73 to allow for the rise from near Sea Level at Padstow to a summit at 860 feet above Sea Level between Camelford and Otterham and the line constantly curved, typically with a radius of 30 chains, in order to follow the contours and avoid costly earthworks. The result was a typical journey from Halwill to Padstow that occupied 90 to 100 minutes down and up to 110 minutes in the up direction. These times were reduced over the years with more powerful locomotives so that by the 1940s journey times between Launceston and Padstow were typically 80 minutes in the down direction and 90 minutes in the up. The maximum speed permitted on the North Cornwall line was 55&nbsp;mph.<ref name = Wroe>{{cite book|last=Wroe|first=David.|title=An Illustrated History of the North Cornwall Railway|date=1995|publisher=Irwell Press|location=Caernarfon|isbn=1 871608 63 5}}</ref>\n\nThe 1938 ''Bradshaw's Railway Guide''<ref>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's Railway Guide for July 1938| edition=1968 reprint| publisher=David and Charles| location=Newton Abbot}}</ref> shows five down and six up trains a day (Monday to Friday) on the line, plus a first up train from Launceston to Halwill and a last up train from Padstow to Launceston, and a last down train from Halwill to Launceston. All the trains called at all stations with the exception of the [[Atlantic Coast Express]], the 11:00 from Waterloo, which ran non-stop Exeter St Davids to Halwill, then Launceston, Otterham, Camelford, Delabole, Port Isaac Road and Wadebridge, arriving in Padstow at 4:24 after a {{convert|260|mi|km|adj=on}} journey. The train conveyed a restaurant car throughout. The Saturday service was similar, although congestion earlier in the journey meant a slightly slower journey. There was no Sunday service.\n\nTender engines were preferred on the line, the Adams Jubilee class being dominant at first, supplanted by the T9 class 4-4-0 being dominant in the Edwardian era. Until the mid-1940s the weight restriction over [[Meldon Viaduct]] and the short turntable at Padstow prevented anything larger than the Southern Railway mixed traffic 2-6-0 types from working over the line. However, after the turntable was replaced, the Bulleid Light Pacific locomotives were able to use the line.<ref name=\"wilson\"/> On summer Saturdays in the 1950s, some trains loaded to ten coaches, and in that era the Standard 2-6-4T class came into use on the line.<ref name = vaughan/>\n\nWhile the GWR could easily serve major Devon and Cornwall resorts on its main line and branches, the rugged North Cornwall terrain prevented this. However Southern National omnibus connections gave journey options: Tintagel and Boscastle had good connections from Camelford, Newquay from Wadebridge, and [[Bedruthan]] and [[Trevone]] Bay from Padstow. Otterham is marked in the timetable as being the \"Station for Wilsey Down and Davidstow (2\u00bd miles) and Crackington Haven (5 miles)\".\n\nBy 1964<ref>{{cite book| title=Working Time Table, Section P, Winter 1964/65| author=British Railways Western Region}}</ref> the passenger service had declined to four trains a day plus a Halwill to Launceston short return journey.\n\nMotive power in later years had been the T9 4-4-0 Greyhounds and the N class 2-6-0s but with [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain Classes|Bulleid Pacifics]], often on uneconomically short trains, putting in an appearance.\n\n==Topography==\n\n===Route===\n[[File:DisusedLSWRailwayBridgeOverPetherickCreekCornwallUK.jpg|thumb|The North Cornwall line crossed Petherick Creek on this three-span iron bridge, now used to carry the [[Camel Trail]] cycleway]]\n\nFrom Halwill the line describes a loop turning from north to south west; it runs downhill at gradients of 1 in 74 and 1 in 82<ref name=\"wilson\"/> to join the valley of the River Carey, following this down for nearly {{convert|10|mi}} to cross the [[River Tamar]] just east of [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], the first station actually in Cornwall. From a summit at Otterham, 800 feet (244&nbsp;m), the line descends into the upper reaches of the [[Camel valley]], passing through [[Camelford]] Station over 2 miles west of Camelford town and then leaving the valley for a gentle climb to the coastal uplands.\n\nAt [[Delabole]] the line skirts the slate quarry, and then descends to the Allen valley, diving briefly through [[Trelill Tunnel]] (333 yards, 304&nbsp;m), before returning to the [[Camel valley]], crossing the river and joining the Bodmin and Wadebridge line into [[Wadebridge railway station|Wadebridge station]].\n\nOnce past Wadebridge the character changes as the line hugs the tidal [[River Camel]] until crossing Little Petherick Creek over a three-span iron bridge and rounding Dennis Hill, it reaches Padstow station which was located on a narrow strip of reclaimed land with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], visible in the distance.<ref name = vaughan>{{cite book| first=John| last=Vaughan| title=Branches and Byways of Cornwall| publisher=Oxford Publishing Company| location=Hersham| year=2002| isbn=0 86093 566 3}}</ref>\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:NCRmap2.gif|thumb|275px|right|Map of stations on the North Cornwall Railway]]\n'''Halwill and Beaworthy'''; LSWR station on the Holsworthy line; renamed [[Halwill Junction railway station|Halwill Junction]] March 1887\n\n'''Ashwater''';see [[Ashwater railway station]]\n\n'''Tower Hill'''; see [[Tower Hill railway station (Devon)]] \n\n'''Launceston'''\n{{Main|Launceston railway station}}; the first station on the line in Cornwall, adjacent to the GWR station.\n\n'''{{visible anchor|Egloskerry}}'''; [[Egloskerry]] station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.6519|-4.4507|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Egloskerry station}})}} opened on 3 October 1892, and had a simple layout with only four points. There was a [[passing loop]], and the station building and signal box were both located on the up platform, with a siding behind serving cattle pens. There was a level crossing at the down end of the station immediately at the platforms' end, the only one between Launceston and Wadebridge.<ref name=Wroe/> The population of the surrounding area dropped between the building of the railway in the early 1890s and closure in the 1960s; it was always sparse and revenue poor resulting in various economies over the years. In the late 1920s responsibility for the station was passed to the Stationmaster at Otterham, and in 1930 the block instruments were moved from the signalbox to the Booking Office under the charge of a porter-signalman. The goods facilities closed on 9 May 1961 and the goods sidings were removed the following year. The station closed on 3 October 1966.

The station was due to open on 1 July 1892 but a landslip in an adjacent cutting delayed this until 28 July.<ref name=BLM3S/> As at all stations on the line there was a passing loop here, with the station building on the down platform and signal box on the up platform. A single siding behind the down platform gave access to a goods shed and loading dock; goods facilities officially ceased in September 1964 although the line to the loading dock had been removed three months earlier. The siding and passing loop were officially taken out of use on 14 November 1964, with the station becoming unstaffed on 6 January 1965. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The Station is now a guest house.\n\n'''{{visible anchor|Otterham}}'''; Otterham station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.6748|-4.6130|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Otterham station}})}} opened on 14 August 1893<ref> Southern Region Record by R.H.Clark</ref> was situated in bleak sparsely populated country at the junction of the [[A39 road|A39]] and the B3262. At {{convert|850|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level it occupied the most exposed section of the line, open to the fury of Atlantic gales in winter - the LSWR planted a group of [[Scots pine|Scots Pines]] on the embankment above the down platform to provide some shelter from weather. A footpath linked the station with the village, which was more than a mile away: by road the distance was {{convert|2|mi|km}}. [[Otterham Station]] was also the name of a hamlet which grew up near the station.\n\nThe down platform was provided with a waiting shelter while the station building and signal box were on the up platform; all three were built of local stone. A single siding on the up side provided access to a loading dock, but there was no goods shed. A second siding parallel to the first was added later. In 1928 Otterham returned the lowest ticket sales on the line. Following the withdrawal of goods facilities on the line on 7 September 1964, the passing loop, sidings, and signal box were officially taken out of use on 7 February 1965, and the trackwork was removed that October. Under the Western Region the station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and appeared as Otterham Halt in WR timetables<REF>{{cite book | last =Kidner | first =R. W. | title =Southern Railway Halts.

Like the waiting shelter on the down platform, the buildings were constructed from local stone. As elsewhere on the line, no footbridge was provided. Cattle pens were provided on the single siding, with the goods shed on a loop between the siding and headshunt.\n\nThe station opened on 14 August 1893, with station signs proclaiming \"[[Camelford]] for [[Boscastle]] and [[Tintagel]]\". Camelford was the busiest intermediate station between Launceston and Wadebridge, but the distance from the town kept the passenger numbers low: in 1928 there was an average of just over 20 tickets issued daily, with 35 collected, and this number steadily declining with improved road transport. No alterations were made to the station layout throughout its life; the sidings were officially taken out of use on 30 November 1965 after the end of goods traffic the previous year, but the signal box and passing loop remained operational until closure on 3 October 1966.\n\nThe small settlement of Camelford Station grew up around the railway and the station site was for a time occupied by the British Cycling Museum (subsequently closed). More information about the area can be found in the article on [[Slaughterbridge]]. The station is now a private residence.\n\n'''Delabole'''; The adjacent Delabole Slate quarry, [[Delabole]] station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.6226|-4.7268|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Delabole station}})}} resulted in considerable outwards mineral traffic. The station opened on 18 October 1893 after the slate company donated 1.5 miles of trackbed free to the LSWR. It was equipped with a passing loop and two platforms. A single siding was provided behind the up platform, which was where the signal box was sited. On the down side the platform had the station building and a short loading dock with the goods shed on a further siding running behind the platform. A single road through engine shed was provided, with a turntable beyond between the goods shed and a line extending to the quarry. There was a considerable narrow gauge tramway network within the quarry, in existence  before the construction of the North Cornwall line. There had earlier been a three-foot gauge network with a four track incline, but by 1879 this had been converted to a 2-feet gauge system with a six-track incline.<ref name = bodman>{{cite book| first=Martin| last=Bodman| title=Inclined Planes in the South West| publisher=Twelveheads Press| location=Truro| year=2012| isbn=978 0 906294 75 8}}</ref>\n\nAs it was situated in the village itself, the station was better used than many on the route, and the proximity of the quarry ensured that freight receipts remained healthy. Goods services were withdrawn on 7 September 1964 and the loading dock was removed; the siding on the down side had been removed some time previously. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The station building is now in use as a private residence, and houses have been built on the site of the up platform.\n\n'''{{visible anchor|Port Isaac Road}}'''; the station {{nowrap|({{coord|50.5764|-4.7703|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Port Isaac Road station}})}} was three miles (5&nbsp;km) from [[Port Isaac]] itself, and opened on 1 June 1895, and had a passing loop and a single siding with headshunt that served a goods shed and loading dock. All buildings were of local stone; the station building and signal box locking room were on the up platform, the small waiting shelter on the down platform, and the goods shed. Ticket sales were low, with nearly 4500 annually in 1928, this dropping to under 2000 in 1936; freight dropped in a similar way over the same period. The station layout never changed; the station siding was taken out of use in December 1965. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966. The station buildings are the best preserved example on the line.\n\n'''St Kew Highway'''; \n[[File:StKewHighwayRailwayBridgeCornwallUK.jpg|thumb|The bridge east of St Kew Highway which carried the line over the [[A39 road]].

Both lines through the station had platforms although the down platform had no buildings and was only accessible via a foot crossing at the down end of the station. The station building itself, like the goods shed, was substantially constructed out of local stone, as was the locking room of the signal box. The passing loop was extended in 1939, but the up loop, sidings and signal box were taken out of use on 21 November 1965 as goods services had ceased on 7 September the previous year. Traffic was never very heavy and by the late 1930s was averaging 5 passengers per day, less than a third of that ten years earlier. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966, although the building functioned for some time as a guest house but is now a private residence.\n\n''Wadebridge Junction'', about a mile east of Wadebridge station, was the point of convergence of the Bodmin lines with the North Cornwall line; from 3 February 1907 a second independent track was provided, the two lines running parallel; the junction signal box was abolished.<ref name = faulkner>{{cite book|last1=Faulkner|first1=J.N.|last2=Williams|first2=R A|title=The LSWR in the Twentieth Century|date=1998|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|isbn=0 7153 8927 0}}</ref>\n\n'''Wadebridge'''; {{Main|Wadebridge railway station}}\n\nWadebridge Station buildings are currently in use as \"The John Betjeman Centre\".\n\n'''Padstow'''; {{Main|Padstow railway station, Cornwall}}\n\n==Steam railway==\nA section of trackbed from Launceston is now in use as the [[Launceston Steam Railway]], and the section from Wadebridge to Padstow is now part of the [[Camel Trail]].\n\n==Poetical reference==\nThe North Cornwall Railway is commemorated in Sir [[John Betjeman]]'s classic verse autobiography ''[[Summoned by Bells]]''.
