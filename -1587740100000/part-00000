The most common example of germination is the [[sprouting]] of a [[seedling]] from a [[seed]] of an [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] or [[gymnosperm]]. Germination also includes the growth of a [[sporeling]] from a [[spore]], such as the spores of [[Fungus]], ferns, [[bacteria]], and the growth of the [[pollen tube]] from the pollen grain of seed plants.\n\n== Seed plants ==\n[[Image:Horticulture Tray3.jpg|thumb|150px|A seed tray used in horticulture for sowing and taking plant cuttings and growing [[Plug (horticulture)|plugs]]]]\n[[File:Sprossenglas.JPG|thumb|Germination glass (glass sprouter jar) with a plastic [[sieve]]-lid]]\n[[Image:Raapstelen gekiemde zaden (Brassica campestris germinating seeds).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Brassica|Brassica campestris]]'' germinating seeds]]\n[[File:Mung bean germination.ogv|right|250px|Time lapse video of mung bean seeds germinating]]\nGermination is usually the growth of a plant contained within a seed; it results in the formation of the seedling. It is also the process of reactivation of metabolic machinery of the seed resulting in the emergence of radicle and plumule. The seed of a [[vascular plant]] is a small package produced in a [[fruit]] or [[conifer cone|cone]] after the union of male and female reproductive cells. All fully developed seeds contain an [[embryo]] and, in most plant species some store of food reserves, wrapped in a seed coat. Some plants produce varying numbers of seeds that lack embryos; these are empty seeds which never germinate. Dormant seeds are viable seeds that do not germinate because they require specific internal or environmental stimuli to resume growth. Under proper conditions, the seed begins to germinate and the embryo resumes growth, developing into a seedling.{{clarify|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Seed Germination.png|thumb|<br>\n-Step 1- Water imbibition, the uptake of water, results in rupture of seed coat. <br>\n-Step 2-The imbibition of the seed coat results in emergence of the [[radicle]] (1) and the [[plumule]](2), the [[cotyledons]] get unfolded(3). <br>\n-Step 3-This marks the final step in the germination of the seed  where the cotyledons are expanded which are the true leaves/peasNote-  Temperature must be kept at an optimum level.]] \nSeed germination depends on both internal and external conditions. The most important external factors include right [[temperature]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] or [[air]] and sometimes [[light]] or [[darkness]].<ref name=\"Raven\" /> Various plants require different variables for successful seed germination. Often this depends on the individual seed variety and is closely linked to the [[Ecology|ecological conditions]] of a plant's [[natural habitat]].  For some seeds, their future germination response is affected by environmental conditions during seed formation; most often these responses are types of [[seed dormancy]].\n\n* '''Water'''  is required for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular [[metabolism]] and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water to moisten the seeds but not enough to soak them.  The uptake of water by seeds is called [[imbibition]], which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as [[starch]], [[protein]]s, or [[oil]]s. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, [[hydrolytic enzyme]]s are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful [[chemical]]s.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>  After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling's food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.\n* '''Oxygen  '''is required by the germinating seed for [[metabolism]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegel SM, Rosen LA | year = 1962 | title = Effects of Reduced Oxygen Tension on Germination and Seedling Growth | url = | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 437\u2013444 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1962.tb08047.x }}</ref>  Oxygen is used in [[aerobic respiration]], the main source of the seedling's energy until it grows leaves.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> Oxygen is an [[atmospheric gas]] that is found in [[soil]] pore spaces; if a seed is buried too deeply within the soil or the soil is waterlogged, the seed can be oxygen starved.  Some seeds have impermeable seed coats that prevent oxygen from entering the seed, causing a type of physical dormancy which is broken when the seed coat is worn away enough to allow gas exchange and water uptake from the environment.\n* '''Temperature'''  affects cellular metabolic and growth rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds from the same plant germinate over a wide range of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) [room-temperature in centrally heated houses], while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C).  Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures ([[vernalization]]) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy.  For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination .<ref>{{Cite book|title=Variation in Seed Dormancy and Germination within and between Individuals and Populations of a Species.

Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a [[forest fire]] which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy. \nMost common annual [[vegetable]]s have optimal germination temperatures between 75-90 F (24-32 C), though many species (e.g. [[radish]]es or [[spinach]]) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, as low as 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.\n* '''Light or darkness'''  can be an environmental trigger for germination and is a type of physiological dormancy. Most seeds are not affected by light or darkness, but many seeds, including species found in forest settings, will not germinate until an opening in the canopy allows sufficient light for growth of the seedling.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\nScarification mimics natural processes that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as the heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water for a long period of time. Others need to be passed through an animal's [[digestive tract]] to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg|thumb|250px|Malted (germinated) [[barley]] grains]]\n\n=== Dormancy ===\nSome live seeds are [[dormancy|dormant]] and need more time, and/or need to be subjected to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. [[Seed dormancy]] can originate in different parts of the seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = J Derek | last1 = Bewley | first2 = Michael | last2 = Black | first3 = Peter | last3 = Halmer | name-list-format = vanc | title = The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses Cabi Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aE414KuXu4gC&pg=PA203| year = 2006| journal = CABI| pages = 203| isbn = 978-0-85199-723-0 }}</ref> Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably [[abscisic acid]], which inhibits germination, and [[gibberellin]], which ends seed dormancy. In [[brewing]], barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley [[malt]].<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Seedling establishment ===\nIn some definitions, the appearance of the [[radicle]] marks the end of germination and the beginning of \"establishment\", a period that utilizes the food reserves stored in the seed. Germination and establishment as an independent organism are critical phases in the life of a plant when they are the most vulnerable to injury, disease, and water stress.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> The germination index can be used as an indicator of [[phytotoxicity]] in soils. The mortality between dispersal of seeds and completion of establishment can be so high that many species have adapted to produce large numbers of seeds.\n\n== Germination rate and germination capacity ==\n[[File:Seedling of Eucalyptus.jpg|thumb|Germination of [[seedlings]] raised from [[seeds]] of [[eucalyptus]] after 3 days of [[sowing]].]]\nIn [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], the '''germination rate''' describes how many seeds of a particular [[plant]] [[species]], variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It is a measure of germination time course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. Seed germination rate is determined by both the seed genetic composition, morphological features and environmental factors.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  The germination rate is useful for calculating the seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. In seed physiologists and seed scientists \"germination rate\" is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. seed lot) is referred as '''germination capacity'''.\n\n===Repair of DNA damage===\n\n[[Seed]] quality deteriorates with age, and this is associated with accumulation of genome damage.<ref name=\"pmid25750428\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Bray CM, West CE | title = The importance of safeguarding genome integrity in germination and seed longevity | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 3549\u201358 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25750428 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erv080 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  During germination, [[DNA repair|repair]] processes are activated to deal with accumulated [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].<ref name=\"pmid11321247\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koppen G, Verschaeve L | title = The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay: a way to study DNA repair in radicle cells of germinating Vicia faba | journal = Folia Biologica | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 50\u20134 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11321247 | doi =  }}</ref>  In particular, single- and double-strand breaks in DNA can be repaired.<ref name=\"pmid20584150\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Masnavi G, Bhardwaj RM, Jiang Q, Bray CM, West CE | title = A plant DNA ligase is an important determinant of seed longevity | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 5 | pages = 848\u201360 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20584150 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04285.x }}</ref> The DNA damage checkpoint kinase [[ATM serine/threonine kinase|ATM]] has a major role in integrating progression through germination with repair responses to the DNA damages accumulated by the aged seed.<ref name=\"pmid27503884\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Footitt S, Bray CM, Finch-Savage WE, West CE | title = DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM regulates germination and maintains genome stability in seeds | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 34 | pages = 9647\u201352 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27503884 | pmc = 5003248 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1608829113 }}</ref>\n\n=== Dicot germination ===\n[[File:Stages of germination in pea plants.svg|thumb|The stages of germination of a pea plant. A.Seed Coat B. Radicle C. Primary Root D. Secondary Root E. Cotyledon F. Plumule G. Leaf H. Tap Root]]\nThe part of the plant that first emerges from the seed is the embryonic root, termed the [[radicle]] or primary root. It allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, an embryonic [[shoot]] emerges from the seed. This shoot comprises three main parts: the [[cotyledon]]s (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons ([[hypocotyl]]), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons ([[epicotyl]]). The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups.<ref name=\"Raven\">{{cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Raven | first2 = Ray Franklin | last2 = Evert | first3 = Susan E | last3 = Eichhorn | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology of Plants | url = https://archive.org/details/biologyofplants00rave_0 | url-access = registration | edition = 7th | publisher = W.H.

Once it reaches the surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. [[Bean]]s, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n==== Hypogeal ====\nGermination can also be done by hypogeal germination  (or hypogeous germination), where the epicotyl elongates and forms the hook. In this type of germination, the cotyledons stay underground where they eventually decompose. Peas, [[Gram (disambiguation)#Agriculture and horticulture|gram]] and mango, for example, germinate this way.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Sadhu MK |title=Plant propagation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K-gQh6OI7GcC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=mango+hypogeous+germination#v=onepage&q=mango%20hypogeous%20germination&f=false|year=1989|publisher=New Age International|page=61|isbn=978-81-224-0065-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Monocot germination ===\nIn [[monocot]] seeds, the embryo's radicle and cotyledon are covered by a [[coleorhiza]] and [[coleoptile]], respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n[\n\n=== Precocious germination ===\nWhen a seed germinates without undergoing all four stages of seed development, i.e., globular, heart shape, torpedo shape, and cotyledonary stage, it is known as precocious germination.\n\n== Pollen germination ==\nAnother germination event during the life cycle of [[gymnosperm]]s and [[flowering plant]]s is the germination of a pollen grain after [[pollination]]. Like seeds, [[pollen]] grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2\u20133 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a [[tube cell (plant)|tube cell]]. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive [[flower]] (or a female [[Conifer cone|cone]] in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by [[Tissue hydration|hydration]] on the stigma, as well as by the structure and [[physiology]] of the stigma and style.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> Pollen can also be induced to germinate ''in vitro'' (in a [[petri dish]] or test tube).<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin FW | title = In vitro measurement of pollen tube growth inhibition | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 924\u20135 | date = June 1972 | pmid = 16658085 | pmc = 366081 | doi = 10.1104/pp.49.6.924 }}</ref><ref name=\"Pfahler\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfahler PL | title = In vitro germination characteristics of maize pollen to detect biological activity of environmental pollutants | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 37 | issue =  | pages = 125\u201332 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7460877 | pmc = 1568653 | doi = 10.2307/3429260 | jstor = 3429260 }}</ref>\n\nDuring germination, the tube cell elongates into a [[pollen tube]]. In the flower, the pollen tube then grows towards the [[ovule]] where it discharges the [[sperm]] produced in the pollen grain for fertilization. The germinated pollen grain with its two sperm cells is the mature male [[Gametophyte|microgametophyte]] of these plants.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Self-incompatibility ===\nSince most plants carry both male and female reproductive organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of self-pollination and thus [[inbreeding]]. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this self-pollination. Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In [[self-incompatibility in plants]], the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.<ref name=\"Takayama\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takayama S, Isogai A | title = Self-incompatibility in plants | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 467\u201389 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15862104 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144249 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/725dbeaeff1bb6b5441887253ca8c4de71f3b5d3 }}</ref>\n\n== Spore germination ==\nGermination can also refer to the emergence of cells from [[resting spore]]s and the growth of [[sporeling]] [[hypha]]e or [[Thallus|thalli]] from spores in [[Fungus|fungi]], [[alga]]e and some plants.\n\n[[Conidia]] are asexual reproductive (reproduction without the fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes in that they are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roca MG, Davide LC, Davide LM, Mendes-Costa MC, Schwan RF, Wheals AE | title = Conidial anastomosis fusion between Colletotrichum species | journal = Mycological Research | volume = 108 | issue = Pt 11 | pages = 1320\u20136 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15587065 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756204000838 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.3369 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roca MG, Arlt J, Jeffree CE, Read ND | title = Cell biology of conidial anastomosis tubes in Neurospora crassa | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 911\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15879525 | pmc = 1140100 | doi = 10.1128/EC.4.5.911-919.2005 }}</ref>\n\n=== Resting spores ===\nIn [[resting spore]]s, germination involves cracking the thick cell wall of the dormant spore. For example, in [[zygomycete]]s the thick-walled zygosporangium cracks open and the [[zygospore]] inside gives rise to the emerging sporangiophore. In [[Slime mould|slime molds]], germination refers to the emergence of [[amoeboid]] cells from the hardened spore. After cracking the spore coat, further development involves cell division, but not necessarily the development of a multicellular organism (for example in the free-living amoebas of slime molds).<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Ferns and mosses ===\nIn [[plant]]s such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and a few others, spores germinate into independent [[gametophyte]]s. In the bryophytes (e.g., [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]), spores germinate into [[protonema]]ta, similar to fungal hyphae, from which the gametophyte grows. In [[fern]]s, the gametophytes are small, heart-shaped [[prothalli]] that can often be found underneath a spore-shedding adult plant.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Bacteria ===\nBacterial spores can be [[exospore]]s or [[endospore]]s which are dormant structures produced by a number of different bacteria.

Germination also includes the growth of a [[sporeling]] from a [[spore]], such as the spores of [[Fungus]], ferns, [[bacteria]], and the growth of the [[pollen tube]] from the pollen grain of seed plants.\n\n== Seed plants ==\n[[Image:Horticulture Tray3.jpg|thumb|150px|A seed tray used in horticulture for sowing and taking plant cuttings and growing [[Plug (horticulture)|plugs]]]]\n[[File:Sprossenglas.JPG|thumb|Germination glass (glass sprouter jar) with a plastic [[sieve]]-lid]]\n[[Image:Raapstelen gekiemde zaden (Brassica campestris germinating seeds).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Brassica|Brassica campestris]]'' germinating seeds]]\n[[File:Mung bean germination.ogv|right|250px|Time lapse video of mung bean seeds germinating]]\nGermination is usually the growth of a plant contained within a seed; it results in the formation of the seedling. It is also the process of reactivation of metabolic machinery of the seed resulting in the emergence of radicle and plumule. The seed of a [[vascular plant]] is a small package produced in a [[fruit]] or [[conifer cone|cone]] after the union of male and female reproductive cells. All fully developed seeds contain an [[embryo]] and, in most plant species some store of food reserves, wrapped in a seed coat. Some plants produce varying numbers of seeds that lack embryos; these are empty seeds which never germinate. Dormant seeds are viable seeds that do not germinate because they require specific internal or environmental stimuli to resume growth. Under proper conditions, the seed begins to germinate and the embryo resumes growth, developing into a seedling.{{clarify|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Seed Germination.png|thumb|<br>\n-Step 1- Water imbibition, the uptake of water, results in rupture of seed coat. <br>\n-Step 2-The imbibition of the seed coat results in emergence of the [[radicle]] (1) and the [[plumule]](2), the [[cotyledons]] get unfolded(3). <br>\n-Step 3-This marks the final step in the germination of the seed  where the cotyledons are expanded which are the true leaves/peasNote-  Temperature must be kept at an optimum level.]] \nSeed germination depends on both internal and external conditions. The most important external factors include right [[temperature]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] or [[air]] and sometimes [[light]] or [[darkness]].<ref name=\"Raven\" /> Various plants require different variables for successful seed germination. Often this depends on the individual seed variety and is closely linked to the [[Ecology|ecological conditions]] of a plant's [[natural habitat]].  For some seeds, their future germination response is affected by environmental conditions during seed formation; most often these responses are types of [[seed dormancy]].\n\n* '''Water'''  is required for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular [[metabolism]] and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water to moisten the seeds but not enough to soak them.  The uptake of water by seeds is called [[imbibition]], which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as [[starch]], [[protein]]s, or [[oil]]s. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, [[hydrolytic enzyme]]s are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful [[chemical]]s.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>  After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling's food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.\n* '''Oxygen  '''is required by the germinating seed for [[metabolism]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegel SM, Rosen LA | year = 1962 | title = Effects of Reduced Oxygen Tension on Germination and Seedling Growth | url = | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 437\u2013444 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1962.tb08047.x }}</ref>  Oxygen is used in [[aerobic respiration]], the main source of the seedling's energy until it grows leaves.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> Oxygen is an [[atmospheric gas]] that is found in [[soil]] pore spaces; if a seed is buried too deeply within the soil or the soil is waterlogged, the seed can be oxygen starved.  Some seeds have impermeable seed coats that prevent oxygen from entering the seed, causing a type of physical dormancy which is broken when the seed coat is worn away enough to allow gas exchange and water uptake from the environment.\n* '''Temperature'''  affects cellular metabolic and growth rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds from the same plant germinate over a wide range of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) [room-temperature in centrally heated houses], while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C).  Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures ([[vernalization]]) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy.  For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination .<ref>{{Cite book|title=Variation in Seed Dormancy and Germination within and between Individuals and Populations of a Species.

Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a [[forest fire]] which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy. \nMost common annual [[vegetable]]s have optimal germination temperatures between 75-90 F (24-32 C), though many species (e.g. [[radish]]es or [[spinach]]) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, as low as 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.\n* '''Light or darkness'''  can be an environmental trigger for germination and is a type of physiological dormancy. Most seeds are not affected by light or darkness, but many seeds, including species found in forest settings, will not germinate until an opening in the canopy allows sufficient light for growth of the seedling.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\nScarification mimics natural processes that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as the heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water for a long period of time. Others need to be passed through an animal's [[digestive tract]] to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg|thumb|250px|Malted (germinated) [[barley]] grains]]\n\n=== Dormancy ===\nSome live seeds are [[dormancy|dormant]] and need more time, and/or need to be subjected to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. [[Seed dormancy]] can originate in different parts of the seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = J Derek | last1 = Bewley | first2 = Michael | last2 = Black | first3 = Peter | last3 = Halmer | name-list-format = vanc | title = The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses Cabi Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aE414KuXu4gC&pg=PA203| year = 2006| journal = CABI| pages = 203| isbn = 978-0-85199-723-0 }}</ref> Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably [[abscisic acid]], which inhibits germination, and [[gibberellin]], which ends seed dormancy. In [[brewing]], barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley [[malt]].<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Seedling establishment ===\nIn some definitions, the appearance of the [[radicle]] marks the end of germination and the beginning of \"establishment\", a period that utilizes the food reserves stored in the seed. Germination and establishment as an independent organism are critical phases in the life of a plant when they are the most vulnerable to injury, disease, and water stress.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> The germination index can be used as an indicator of [[phytotoxicity]] in soils. The mortality between dispersal of seeds and completion of establishment can be so high that many species have adapted to produce large numbers of seeds.\n\n== Germination rate and germination capacity ==\n[[File:Seedling of Eucalyptus.jpg|thumb|Germination of [[seedlings]] raised from [[seeds]] of [[eucalyptus]] after 3 days of [[sowing]].]]\nIn [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], the '''germination rate''' describes how many seeds of a particular [[plant]] [[species]], variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It is a measure of germination time course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. Seed germination rate is determined by both the seed genetic composition, morphological features and environmental factors.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  The germination rate is useful for calculating the seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. In seed physiologists and seed scientists \"germination rate\" is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. seed lot) is referred as '''germination capacity'''.\n\n===Repair of DNA damage===\n\n[[Seed]] quality deteriorates with age, and this is associated with accumulation of genome damage.<ref name=\"pmid25750428\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Bray CM, West CE | title = The importance of safeguarding genome integrity in germination and seed longevity | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 3549\u201358 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25750428 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erv080 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  During germination, [[DNA repair|repair]] processes are activated to deal with accumulated [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].<ref name=\"pmid11321247\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koppen G, Verschaeve L | title = The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay: a way to study DNA repair in radicle cells of germinating Vicia faba | journal = Folia Biologica | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 50\u20134 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11321247 | doi =  }}</ref>  In particular, single- and double-strand breaks in DNA can be repaired.<ref name=\"pmid20584150\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Masnavi G, Bhardwaj RM, Jiang Q, Bray CM, West CE | title = A plant DNA ligase is an important determinant of seed longevity | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 5 | pages = 848\u201360 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20584150 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04285.x }}</ref> The DNA damage checkpoint kinase [[ATM serine/threonine kinase|ATM]] has a major role in integrating progression through germination with repair responses to the DNA damages accumulated by the aged seed.<ref name=\"pmid27503884\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterworth WM, Footitt S, Bray CM, Finch-Savage WE, West CE | title = DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM regulates germination and maintains genome stability in seeds | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 34 | pages = 9647\u201352 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27503884 | pmc = 5003248 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1608829113 }}</ref>\n\n=== Dicot germination ===\n[[File:Stages of germination in pea plants.svg|thumb|The stages of germination of a pea plant. A.Seed Coat B. Radicle C. Primary Root D. Secondary Root E. Cotyledon F. Plumule G. Leaf H. Tap Root]]\nThe part of the plant that first emerges from the seed is the embryonic root, termed the [[radicle]] or primary root. It allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, an embryonic [[shoot]] emerges from the seed. This shoot comprises three main parts: the [[cotyledon]]s (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons ([[hypocotyl]]), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons ([[epicotyl]]). The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups.<ref name=\"Raven\">{{cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Raven | first2 = Ray Franklin | last2 = Evert | first3 = Susan E | last3 = Eichhorn | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology of Plants | url = https://archive.org/details/biologyofplants00rave_0 | url-access = registration | edition = 7th | publisher = W.H.

Once it reaches the surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. [[Bean]]s, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n==== Hypogeal ====\nGermination can also be done by hypogeal germination  (or hypogeous germination), where the epicotyl elongates and forms the hook. In this type of germination, the cotyledons stay underground where they eventually decompose. Peas, [[Gram (disambiguation)#Agriculture and horticulture|gram]] and mango, for example, germinate this way.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Sadhu MK |title=Plant propagation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K-gQh6OI7GcC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=mango+hypogeous+germination#v=onepage&q=mango%20hypogeous%20germination&f=false|year=1989|publisher=New Age International|page=61|isbn=978-81-224-0065-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Monocot germination ===\nIn [[monocot]] seeds, the embryo's radicle and cotyledon are covered by a [[coleorhiza]] and [[coleoptile]], respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n[\n\n=== Precocious germination ===\nWhen a seed germinates without undergoing all four stages of seed development, i.e., globular, heart shape, torpedo shape, and cotyledonary stage, it is known as precocious germination.\n\n== Pollen germination ==\nAnother germination event during the life cycle of [[gymnosperm]]s and [[flowering plant]]s is the germination of a pollen grain after [[pollination]]. Like seeds, [[pollen]] grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2\u20133 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a [[tube cell (plant)|tube cell]]. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive [[flower]] (or a female [[Conifer cone|cone]] in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by [[Tissue hydration|hydration]] on the stigma, as well as by the structure and [[physiology]] of the stigma and style.<ref name=\"Raven\"/> Pollen can also be induced to germinate ''in vitro'' (in a [[petri dish]] or test tube).<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin FW | title = In vitro measurement of pollen tube growth inhibition | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 924\u20135 | date = June 1972 | pmid = 16658085 | pmc = 366081 | doi = 10.1104/pp.49.6.924 }}</ref><ref name=\"Pfahler\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfahler PL | title = In vitro germination characteristics of maize pollen to detect biological activity of environmental pollutants | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 37 | issue =  | pages = 125\u201332 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7460877 | pmc = 1568653 | doi = 10.2307/3429260 | jstor = 3429260 }}</ref>\n\nDuring germination, the tube cell elongates into a [[pollen tube]]. In the flower, the pollen tube then grows towards the [[ovule]] where it discharges the [[sperm]] produced in the pollen grain for fertilization. The germinated pollen grain with its two sperm cells is the mature male [[Gametophyte|microgametophyte]] of these plants.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Self-incompatibility ===\nSince most plants carry both male and female reproductive organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of self-pollination and thus [[inbreeding]]. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this self-pollination. Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In [[self-incompatibility in plants]], the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.<ref name=\"Takayama\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takayama S, Isogai A | title = Self-incompatibility in plants | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 467\u201389 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15862104 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144249 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/725dbeaeff1bb6b5441887253ca8c4de71f3b5d3 }}</ref>\n\n== Spore germination ==\nGermination can also refer to the emergence of cells from [[resting spore]]s and the growth of [[sporeling]] [[hypha]]e or [[Thallus|thalli]] from spores in [[Fungus|fungi]], [[alga]]e and some plants.\n\n[[Conidia]] are asexual reproductive (reproduction without the fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes in that they are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roca MG, Davide LC, Davide LM, Mendes-Costa MC, Schwan RF, Wheals AE | title = Conidial anastomosis fusion between Colletotrichum species | journal = Mycological Research | volume = 108 | issue = Pt 11 | pages = 1320\u20136 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15587065 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756204000838 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.3369 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roca MG, Arlt J, Jeffree CE, Read ND | title = Cell biology of conidial anastomosis tubes in Neurospora crassa | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 911\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15879525 | pmc = 1140100 | doi = 10.1128/EC.4.5.911-919.2005 }}</ref>\n\n=== Resting spores ===\nIn [[resting spore]]s, germination involves cracking the thick cell wall of the dormant spore. For example, in [[zygomycete]]s the thick-walled zygosporangium cracks open and the [[zygospore]] inside gives rise to the emerging sporangiophore. In [[Slime mould|slime molds]], germination refers to the emergence of [[amoeboid]] cells from the hardened spore. After cracking the spore coat, further development involves cell division, but not necessarily the development of a multicellular organism (for example in the free-living amoebas of slime molds).<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Ferns and mosses ===\nIn [[plant]]s such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and a few others, spores germinate into independent [[gametophyte]]s. In the bryophytes (e.g., [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]), spores germinate into [[protonema]]ta, similar to fungal hyphae, from which the gametophyte grows. In [[fern]]s, the gametophytes are small, heart-shaped [[prothalli]] that can often be found underneath a spore-shedding adult plant.<ref name=\"Raven\"/>\n\n=== Bacteria ===\nBacterial spores can be [[exospore]]s or [[endospore]]s which are dormant structures produced by a number of different bacteria.

The episodes were written by [[Joseph Mallozzi]], [[Paul Mullie]], [[Executive producer]]s [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]], the episodes were directed by [[Peter DeLuise]]. The episodes were the strongest episodes in the eighth season on the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household ratings]] with fellow ''Stargate SG-1'' episode \"[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]\". The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide.\n\n\"Moebius\" is about the discovery of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) by SG-1, the only problem is that it was taken by [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] after the [[Goa'uld|Earth revolt]] more than five thousand years ago. The team decides to [[Time travel|travel back in time]] to get the ZPM and leave without changing history (based on the fact that Ra and company were most likely unaware of the ZPM's purpose), but they are unable to travel back to present time so they record a video for the [[Government of the United States|United States government]] to find. In the [[alternate timeline]], the government find the tape and subsequently the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] in [[Antarctica]] and decide to establish the [[Stargate Program]] but not to restore the original timeline.\n\n== Plot overview ==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Part 1 ===\n[[Samantha Carter|Samantha \"Sam\" Carter]] reveals the existence of the ''Daedalus'': a new Earth-built battlecruiser which is capable of reaching the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]] and is larger and more advanced than the ''[[Prometheus (Stargate)|Prometheus]]''. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] learns of [[Catherine Langford]]'s death and, after her funeral, receives Catherine's collection of documents and artifacts relating to the Stargate program. From one book in the collection, Daniel learns of the former location of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Daniel and Carter persuade [[Jack O'Neill]] to use the time travel capabilities of the Puddle Jumper [[It's Good to Be King (Stargate SG-1)|they found]] to travel back and take the ZPM, assuming that [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] never knew of its purpose.\n\nOnce they arrive in 3000 B.C., they join in an offering to Ra and witness his cold-blooded murder of an Egyptian making the offering. Teal'c disguises himself as a Horus Jaffa and retrieves the ZPM from Ra's treasury. However, Ra's Jaffa discover the cloaked Jumper after a sandstorm covers it in sand. Unwilling to upset the future by fighting the Jaffa to get the Jumper back, SG-1 decides to live out the rest of their lives in the past, knowing that the rebellion that overthrew Ra will eventually happen. However, an alternate timeline is created in which the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] was never discovered and everything SG-1 have done for the last eight years never happened.\n\nIn this timeline, alternate Daniel is teaching English as a second language, alternate Carter spends her time double-checking other scientists' work, alternate O'Neill is retired from the military and alternate [[Teal'c]] is still the First Prime of [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are contacted by the Air Force and brought to Cheyenne Mountain.\n\nAt Cheyenne Mountain, [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] informs alternate Carter and alternate Daniel that archaeologists found a video camera in a vacuum-sealed [[canopic jar]] at a dig in Giza. The video contains a recording of the original SG-1, explaining who they are and what they were doing, as well as a number of things that are true in their timeline, such as recent political events, Presidents and personal details. Their plan is that if things have changed in the future, then SG-1's alternative selves will travel back in time and fix the past.\n\nAn expedition team is sent to find the Giza Stargate, but find nothing. Instead, they discover that the original Daniel left a tablet where the gate should have been, inscribed with an obscure dialect of Egyptian that only alternate Daniel can read. It reveals that the original [[SG-1]] instigated a successful rebellion against the [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] of 3000 BC. However, this caused him to leave [[Earth]] with the Stargate. However, they do find the Puddle Jumper, and alternate Daniel and alternate Carter figure out how to find the Antarctic Stargate. A team is assembled to go through the Stargate to recruit alternate [[Teal'c]] under the instruction of the Daniel and Carter on the tape. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are not going to be on this team.\n\n=== Part 2 ===\nThe scientists working on the recovered Alternate-Puddle Jumper cannot make it work because they do not have the ATA gene. Alternate-O'Neill is called in to operate the Jumper and lead the team through the Stargate to find alternate Teal'c, and agrees that alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are to join the team through the Stargate.\n\nOn Chulak, SG-1 are caught by Jaffa loyal to [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] and imprisoned. Alternate Teal'c defects to their cause and helps them escape but alternate Daniel was made a Goa'uld spy by Apophis and is killed by Teal'c. They escape in the Puddle Jumper, but are chased and damaged by Death Gliders. Unaware of the jumper's cloaking capacity, they believe that only way they can survive is to time-travel. They travel back to 3000 B.C. and use the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to pass from Chulak to Ancient [[Egypt]] where the original versions of [[SG-1]] were stranded and where [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] is still alive and ruling.\n\nThe original [[SG-1]] attempted the rebellion because O'Neill and Teal'c did not want to stay and O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c were killed when it failed. Daniel, the only survivor, meets with alternate Carter, alternate O'Neill and alternate Teal'c. He has not yet made the tablet detailing the second successful rebellion attempt because it hasn't happened yet. This means that his current plans with the underground of the local populace are destined to succeed, however they lead to the Stargate being removed from Earth by Ra. The plan is to instigate the rebellion, thus diverting Ra's attention, and secure the Stargate to where it was originally buried, allowing the original timeline to evolve as it did.\n\nThe rebellion ultimately succeeds, but not before alternate Carter and alternate-O'Neill show their feelings for each other with a kiss, uncertain if they will survive. Ra's Jaffa surrender, outnumbered by the staff- and zat-armed Egyptians. The alternate SG-1 bury the videotape, along with the ZPM, for the [[SG-1]] of the future to find. The alternate-[[SG-1]] and Daniel from the original [[SG-1]] (of 3000 BC) live out the rest of their lives in Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe original [[SG-1]] of the present day receive the videotape and the ZPM left for them a few weeks before they were to go back in time. As the timeline has been restored, they have no reason to go back in time, and they've gained a ZPM free of charge. The episode ends with SG-1 at O'Neill's cabin, fishing, in a scene identical to the end of \"[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]\", except there are now fish in Jack's pond.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jay Acovone Creation Con 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jay Acovone]]'s character [[Charles Kawalsky]] re-emerged after dying in \"[[The Enemy Within (Stargate SG-1)|The Enemy Within]]\"]]\nAfter production wrapped on [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season seven]], the writers came together and pitched out ideas for the eighth and presumably final season.<ref name=spi_cruising>{{cite news |last=McFarland |first=Melanie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/267484_tv21.html |title=On TV: 'Stargate SG-1' keeps cruising, despite the light years |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=April 21, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> [[Stargate SG-1 (season 5)|Season five]] through [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season seven]] had previously been expected to be the last, but the show got renewed each year.<ref name=ac_811>811 Audio Commentary \"Gemini\" by Will Waring (WW, Director) and Jim Menard (JM, Director of Photography)</ref> They ultimately agreed on about ten initial episodes, two of which should make a two-hour premiere to address left-open issues of the season seven finale.<ref name=spi_cruising/> ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' was originally set to be replaced with a new series entitled ''Stargate Command'', but the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] decided to renew the series for another [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|season]].<ref name=ac_901>{{cite video |people=[[Robert C.

In the same ''SG-1'' episode, the name of O'Neill's boat is \"Homer\". This is one of several references to ''The Simpsons'' on ''Stargate SG-1'', all centered around O'Neill. (However, Carter's line \"I keep thinking I'm gonna step on a bug and change the future,\" may be taken as a reference to ''The Simpsons'', as Homer's stepping on a bug is what caused the changes in his universe.  Alternatively, this line could be a reference to Ray Bradbury's ''[[A Sound of Thunder]],'' the original science fiction story that involved changes in a timeline caused by stepping on an insect, which influenced the Simpsons episode.) Incidentally, in the brief shot of O'Neill boat showing the name, the [[font]] used is the same font used extensively in ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=audiocommentarytwo>{{cite video |people=[[Andy Mikita|Mikita, Andy]] and [[Gary Jones (actor)|Jones, Gary]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for \"New Order\" | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n\"Moebius\" was supposed to be the ''Stargate SG-1'' series finale (like the two previous season finales), so many actors reprised their roles from past episodes: [[Don S.

It trains officers for the [[United States Merchant Marine]], branches of the military, and the transportation industry. Midshipmen (as students at the academy are called) are trained in [[Marine propulsion|marine engineering]], [[navigation]], ship's administration, [[maritime law]], [[human resource management|personnel management]], [[international law]], [[customs]], and many other subjects important to the task of running a large ship. It is one of the five [[United States service academies|U.S. service academies]].\n\n==History==\nBetween 1874 and 1936, diverse federal legislation supported maritime training through school ships, internships at sea, and other methods. A disastrous fire in 1934 aboard the passenger ship [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']], in which 134 lives were lost, convinced the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] that direct federal involvement in efficient and standardized training was needed.\n\nOriginally\u2014and in cooperation with the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which donated the land)\u2014the U.S. government planned to establish a large-scale Merchant Marine Academy at [[Fort Schuyler]], New York; nothing came of these plans.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25 \"New School To Train Ships Officers\"] ''Popular Science'', May 1935</ref> Fort Schuyler would later be used as the grounds for SUNY (State University of New York) Maritime.\n\nCongress passed the landmark [[Merchant Marine Act of 1936|Merchant Marine Act in 1936]], and two years later, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202734/http://www.usmm.org/cadetcorps.html U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps] was established. In that year, the [[USS Nantucket (IX-18)|USTS ''Nantucket'']] (ex-[[USS Ranger (SP-237)|USS ''Ranger'']]) was transferred from the [[Massachusetts Maritime Academy]] to Kings Point and renamed the USTS ''Emory Rice''. The first training was given at temporary facilities until the academy's permanent site in [[Kings Point, New York]] was acquired in early 1942. The Kings Point campus was originally [[Walter Chrysler|Walter Chrysler's]] twelve-acre waterfront estate, named \"Forker House\" (now known as the USMMA's Wiley Hall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melvillehall.com/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201200220/http://www.melvillehall.com/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 December 2010|title=A Brief History|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Construction of the academy began immediately, and 15 months later the task was virtually completed. The academy was dedicated on 30 September 1943, by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who noted \"the Academy serves the Merchant Marine as [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] serves the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] the [[United State Navy|Navy]].\"\n\n[[World War II]] required the academy to forgo its normal operation and to devote all of its resources toward meeting the emergency need for Merchant Marine officers. Its enrollment rose to 2,700 men, and the planned course of instruction was reduced in length from four years to 18 months. To meet the wartime needs for qualified merchant marine officers two additional merchant marine cadet training school sites were established, one located in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], and the other in [[San Mateo, California]]. (The San Mateo location was closed in September 1947, and the students transferred to Kings Point. The location in Pass Christian was similarly closed in 1950.) In spite of the war, shipboard training continued to be an integral part of the academy curriculum, and midshipmen served at sea in combat zones the world over. One hundred and forty-two midshipmen gave their lives in service to their country, and many others survived torpedo and aerial attacks. From 1942 to 1945, the academy graduated 6,895 officers. As the war drew to a close, plans were made to convert the academy's wartime curriculum to a four-year, college-level program to meet the peacetime requirements of the merchant marine. In 1948, such a course was instituted.\n\nAuthorization for awarding the degree of [[bachelor of science]] to graduates was granted by Congress in 1949. The academy became fully accredited as a degree-granting institution in the same year. It was made a permanent institution by an [[Act of Congress]] in 1956. The academy accelerated graduating classes during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. It was involved in such programs as training U.S. officers for the nuclear-powered merchant ship, the ''[[NS Savannah]]''.\n\nAdmission requirements were amended in 1974, and this academy became the first federal service academy to enroll female students, two years before the [[United States Military Academy|Military]], [[United States Naval Academy|Naval]], [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard]] academies.\n\nDuring the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in early 1991, and for many months prior to the war, both academy graduates and midshipmen played important roles in the large [[sealift]] of military supplies to the [[Middle East]]. Midshipmen training at sea also participated in the humanitarian sealift to [[Somalia]] during [[Operation Restore Hope]].\n\nIn 1992, the academy acquired its largest campus-based training vessel, the [[School ship|T/V]] ''[[USNS Contender|Kings Pointer]]''. After 20 years at the academy, MARAD transferred the ship to the [[Texas Maritime Academy]] in [[Galveston]] to serve as its new primary training vessel. This was followed by an announcement on 21 August 2012, that the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] ([[NASA]]) agreed to transfer the [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] to the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] for use as the new training vessel at the academy.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA, Maritime Administration Announce new home for Liberty Star|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/aug/HQ_12-283_Libert_Star_USMMA.html}}</ref> Before being redesigned to serve as a training vessel for students, the former [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] served as a [[solid rocket booster]] recovery vessel for NASA retrieving solid rocket boosters following space shuttle launches.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=USMMA Rechristens Training Vessel Kings Pointer|url=http://www.usmma.edu/about/communications/usmma-rechristens-training-vessel-kings-pointer}}</ref> In June 2014, the vessel was rechristened the ''[[T/V Kings Pointer]]'', the fifth vessel of the academy to carry that name. The rechristening followed the earlier dedication of the academy's newly replaced Mallory Pier.\n\nIn the 1990s, the academy's future came into question when it was included in the ''[[Albert Gore, Jr.#Initiatives|National Performance Review]]'', chaired by [[Vice president|Vice President]] [[Al Gore|Albert Gore, Jr.]] The report recommended halving the federal subsidy and requiring students to pay half of tuition to reduce costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maybe We Should Reinvent Our Merchant Marine Fleet|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930909&slug=1720107}}</ref> Congress, however, soundly rejected the recommendation and voted to continue the prohibitions on charging tuition to students.<ref>{{cite web |title=govinfo.library.unt.edu|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/status/appendices/appa.htm}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2009 and 2014, the Obama Administration invested more than $450 million at the academy, including almost $100 million for capital improvements\u2014the most funding ever secured for physical improvements at the academy.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], the Merchant Marine Academy assisted in the evacuation of civilians from [[Lower Manhattan]] as well as the transportation of first responders and supplies to and from [[Ground Zero]]. Midshipman, faculty, and staff from the academy, within hours of the attack, were using boats from the waterfront and sending them to the city. Members of the Merchant Marine Academy participated in the relief efforts for nine days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc66PsnXPoA|title=Rescue at Water's Edge: The U.S. Merchant Marine Response to 9/11|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nMerchant Marine Academy midshipmen and graduates have been involved in many facets of the [[war in Iraq]]. Many graduates were involved in the transportation of supplies during the buildup to the war in 2003. Many graduates in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]], now known as the [[U.S. Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], have been called to active duty to serve supporting naval roles in ports in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. Graduates who have entered other branches of the service have had more direct roles in Iraq. [[Aaron Seesan]], a 2003 graduate and U.S Army [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]], was the first graduate to give his life for his country due to enemy action during a war since the [[Vietnam War]].  Since that time, two additional graduates, U.S. Navy Lt(jg) Francis L. Toner, IV (class of 2006) and U.S. Marine corps 1st Lt. William N. Donnelly, IV (class of 2008) have both given their lives while serving their country in Afghanistan.\n[[File:GWBush at USMMA.jpg|thumb|right|[[George W.

Midshipmen are typically assigned as pairs to a ship, an engineering cadet and a deck cadet, and operate as part of the crew, gaining hands-on experience as well as the opportunity to travel abroad to foreign ports; the average midshipman travels to eighteen countries during the three-hundred-day training period.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> This practical training results in an extended academic year that runs from late July to mid-June.\n\nToward the end of 1st class (senior) year, midshipmen prepare for [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] exams for a mandatory license as [[Third Assistant Engineer]] (steam and motor unlimited HP) or [[Third Mate]] (any gross tons, oceans).\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Merchant Marine Mariners}}\n[[File:Secretaries Cup (32783190664).jpg|thumb|Secretaries Cup Rivalry football game between the Merchant Marine Academy and [[Coast Guard Academy]]]]\nThe USMMA Mariners compete in [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] of the [[NCAA]], as a member of the [[Skyline Conference]] in all sports (men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, and track & field; women's sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, swimming & diving, track & field, and volleyball) except in football, where they are an associate member of the [[Liberty League]], and [[collegiate wrestling]], where they are a member of the [[Centennial Conference]]. The USMMA was a member of the [[Skyline Conference]] until the 2006\u201307 season; the USMMA returned to the Skyline Conference for the 2016\u201317 academic year. The academy was also a charter member in the [[Landmark Conference]] from 2007 until 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmmasports.com/general/2014-15/skyline|title=USMMA Athletics Accepts Invitation To Join The Skyline Conference Beginning In 2016-17|author=|date=22 May 2015|website=usmmasports.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Distinguished midshipmen==\nThe [[Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal]] is the highest award which can be bestowed upon members of the United States Merchant Marine and is the service\u2019s equivalent of the [[Medal of Honor]]. Since mariners serving in the U.S. Merchant Marine are not directly employed by the Department of Defense, they are not eligible for the Medal of Honor.\n\nSince USMMA opened in 1943, eight midshipmen have been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.\n*Midshipman [[Francis A.

Unlike the nation's other federal service academies, graduates of USMMA are required to fulfill their service obligation on their own by providing annual proof of employment in a wide variety of occupations as approved by [[MARAD]] for a specified period of time.\n\nGraduates may elect to fulfill their service obligation by working as licensed officers on U.S.-flagged merchant vessels, as civilians in the [[maritime industry]], or as active duty officers in any branch of the military or the [[uniformed services of the United States]], including [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]], and the [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration]]. Regardless, graduates are required to maintain their U.S. Coast Guard-issued merchant marine officer's license for a period of at least 6 years.\n\nThose graduates electing to enter the civilian work force in the maritime industry, and those sailing in the [[Merchant Marine of the United States|Merchant Marine]], are also required to maintain their [[U.S. Naval Reserve|Navy Reserve]] commission (or another reserve component commission in the Army National Guard or Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air Force National Guard or Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve) for a period of at least 8 years after their commissioning as officers, and are required to serve in the maritime industry for at least 5 years following graduation.\n\n* On average about 1/3 of each graduating class goes to sea working in the Merchant Marine as [[Navy Reserve Merchant Marine Insignia|Strategic Sealift Officers]] serving in the [[Military Sealift Command]] (part of the U.S. Navy) and the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]] on various ships in overseas trade, inland & near-coastal transportation, research vessels, and other types of vessels.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n* Another 1/3 generally go to work in the Merchant Marine maritime industry as Mariner Officers ashore working in commercial shipping, ship broking, intermodal logistics, marine engineering, maritime law, maritime insurance, or defense contracting.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n* About 1/3 enter the military as active duty commissioned officers. Of those going on active duty, most enter the [[United States Navy|Navy]] as [[naval aviator]]s, [[naval flight officer]]s, [[surface warfare officer]]s, [[submarine officer]]s, or occasionally even as [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]]. Some midshipmen enter the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], while a small number enter the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and their [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|Reserve]] or [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] components. [[Midshipmen]] may also apply for [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) with the [[NOAA Corps|NOAA Commissioned Corps]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA graduate from USMMA receives upon graduation:\n* A [[Bachelor of Science]] degree,\n* An Unlimited USCG License as a Merchant Marine Officer, either 3rd Mate or 3rd Assistant Engineer, and\n* A Commission as an ensign in the [[U.S. Navy Reserve]] Strategic Sealift Officer Program (see: [[Navy Reserve Merchant Marine Insignia]]), or if accepted, as an ensign in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or as a 2nd lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, or U.S. Air Force.

It trains officers for the [[United States Merchant Marine]], branches of the military, and the transportation industry. Midshipmen (as students at the academy are called) are trained in [[Marine propulsion|marine engineering]], [[navigation]], ship's administration, [[maritime law]], [[human resource management|personnel management]], [[international law]], [[customs]], and many other subjects important to the task of running a large ship. It is one of the five [[United States service academies|U.S. service academies]].\n\n==History==\nBetween 1874 and 1936, diverse federal legislation supported maritime training through school ships, internships at sea, and other methods. A disastrous fire in 1934 aboard the passenger ship [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']], in which 134 lives were lost, convinced the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] that direct federal involvement in efficient and standardized training was needed.\n\nOriginally\u2014and in cooperation with the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which donated the land)\u2014the U.S. government planned to establish a large-scale Merchant Marine Academy at [[Fort Schuyler]], New York; nothing came of these plans.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25 \"New School To Train Ships Officers\"] ''Popular Science'', May 1935</ref> Fort Schuyler would later be used as the grounds for SUNY (State University of New York) Maritime.\n\nCongress passed the landmark [[Merchant Marine Act of 1936|Merchant Marine Act in 1936]], and two years later, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202734/http://www.usmm.org/cadetcorps.html U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps] was established. In that year, the [[USS Nantucket (IX-18)|USTS ''Nantucket'']] (ex-[[USS Ranger (SP-237)|USS ''Ranger'']]) was transferred from the [[Massachusetts Maritime Academy]] to Kings Point and renamed the USTS ''Emory Rice''. The first training was given at temporary facilities until the academy's permanent site in [[Kings Point, New York]] was acquired in early 1942. The Kings Point campus was originally [[Walter Chrysler|Walter Chrysler's]] twelve-acre waterfront estate, named \"Forker House\" (now known as the USMMA's Wiley Hall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melvillehall.com/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201200220/http://www.melvillehall.com/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 December 2010|title=A Brief History|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Construction of the academy began immediately, and 15 months later the task was virtually completed. The academy was dedicated on 30 September 1943, by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who noted \"the Academy serves the Merchant Marine as [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] serves the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] the [[United State Navy|Navy]].\"\n\n[[World War II]] required the academy to forgo its normal operation and to devote all of its resources toward meeting the emergency need for Merchant Marine officers. Its enrollment rose to 2,700 men, and the planned course of instruction was reduced in length from four years to 18 months. To meet the wartime needs for qualified merchant marine officers two additional merchant marine cadet training school sites were established, one located in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], and the other in [[San Mateo, California]]. (The San Mateo location was closed in September 1947, and the students transferred to Kings Point. The location in Pass Christian was similarly closed in 1950.) In spite of the war, shipboard training continued to be an integral part of the academy curriculum, and midshipmen served at sea in combat zones the world over. One hundred and forty-two midshipmen gave their lives in service to their country, and many others survived torpedo and aerial attacks. From 1942 to 1945, the academy graduated 6,895 officers. As the war drew to a close, plans were made to convert the academy's wartime curriculum to a four-year, college-level program to meet the peacetime requirements of the merchant marine. In 1948, such a course was instituted.\n\nAuthorization for awarding the degree of [[bachelor of science]] to graduates was granted by Congress in 1949. The academy became fully accredited as a degree-granting institution in the same year. It was made a permanent institution by an [[Act of Congress]] in 1956. The academy accelerated graduating classes during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. It was involved in such programs as training U.S. officers for the nuclear-powered merchant ship, the ''[[NS Savannah]]''.\n\nAdmission requirements were amended in 1974, and this academy became the first federal service academy to enroll female students, two years before the [[United States Military Academy|Military]], [[United States Naval Academy|Naval]], [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard]] academies.\n\nDuring the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in early 1991, and for many months prior to the war, both academy graduates and midshipmen played important roles in the large [[sealift]] of military supplies to the [[Middle East]]. Midshipmen training at sea also participated in the humanitarian sealift to [[Somalia]] during [[Operation Restore Hope]].\n\nIn 1992, the academy acquired its largest campus-based training vessel, the [[School ship|T/V]] ''[[USNS Contender|Kings Pointer]]''. After 20 years at the academy, MARAD transferred the ship to the [[Texas Maritime Academy]] in [[Galveston]] to serve as its new primary training vessel. This was followed by an announcement on 21 August 2012, that the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] ([[NASA]]) agreed to transfer the [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] to the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] for use as the new training vessel at the academy.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA, Maritime Administration Announce new home for Liberty Star|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/aug/HQ_12-283_Libert_Star_USMMA.html}}</ref> Before being redesigned to serve as a training vessel for students, the former [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] served as a [[solid rocket booster]] recovery vessel for NASA retrieving solid rocket boosters following space shuttle launches.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=USMMA Rechristens Training Vessel Kings Pointer|url=http://www.usmma.edu/about/communications/usmma-rechristens-training-vessel-kings-pointer}}</ref> In June 2014, the vessel was rechristened the ''[[T/V Kings Pointer]]'', the fifth vessel of the academy to carry that name. The rechristening followed the earlier dedication of the academy's newly replaced Mallory Pier.\n\nIn the 1990s, the academy's future came into question when it was included in the ''[[Albert Gore, Jr.#Initiatives|National Performance Review]]'', chaired by [[Vice president|Vice President]] [[Al Gore|Albert Gore, Jr.]] The report recommended halving the federal subsidy and requiring students to pay half of tuition to reduce costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maybe We Should Reinvent Our Merchant Marine Fleet|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930909&slug=1720107}}</ref> Congress, however, soundly rejected the recommendation and voted to continue the prohibitions on charging tuition to students.<ref>{{cite web |title=govinfo.library.unt.edu|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/status/appendices/appa.htm}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2009 and 2014, the Obama Administration invested more than $450 million at the academy, including almost $100 million for capital improvements\u2014the most funding ever secured for physical improvements at the academy.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], the Merchant Marine Academy assisted in the evacuation of civilians from [[Lower Manhattan]] as well as the transportation of first responders and supplies to and from [[Ground Zero]]. Midshipman, faculty, and staff from the academy, within hours of the attack, were using boats from the waterfront and sending them to the city. Members of the Merchant Marine Academy participated in the relief efforts for nine days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc66PsnXPoA|title=Rescue at Water's Edge: The U.S. Merchant Marine Response to 9/11|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nMerchant Marine Academy midshipmen and graduates have been involved in many facets of the [[war in Iraq]]. Many graduates were involved in the transportation of supplies during the buildup to the war in 2003. Many graduates in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]], now known as the [[U.S. Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], have been called to active duty to serve supporting naval roles in ports in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. Graduates who have entered other branches of the service have had more direct roles in Iraq. [[Aaron Seesan]], a 2003 graduate and U.S Army [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]], was the first graduate to give his life for his country due to enemy action during a war since the [[Vietnam War]].  Since that time, two additional graduates, U.S. Navy Lt(jg) Francis L. Toner, IV (class of 2006) and U.S. Marine corps 1st Lt. William N. Donnelly, IV (class of 2008) have both given their lives while serving their country in Afghanistan.\n[[File:GWBush at USMMA.jpg|thumb|right|[[George W.

Marine transportation students learn about ship [[navigation]], cargo handling, [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea|navigation rules]] and [[admiralty law|maritime law]]. These majors grant midshipman a [[Third Mate (Deck Officer)|Third Mate]] license for work on steam or motor vessels of unlimited tonnage.\n* The three \"Engine Majors\" are Marine Engineering, Marine Engineering Systems, and Marine Engineering and Shipyard Management. Marine engineering students learn about the function of the ship's engines and its supporting systems. These majors lead to the issuance of [[Third Assistant Engineer]] (3 A/E \u2013 Engineering Officer) licenses for steam and motor vessel of any horsepower. Marine Engineering Systems, and Marine Engineering and Shipyard Management, graduates are also qualified to sit for the Engineer in Training (EIT) examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).\n\nFor portions of their [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] (third-class) and junior (second-class) years, midshipmen serve as [[cadet]]s on U.S. merchant ships. Midshipmen are typically assigned as pairs to a ship, an engineering cadet and a deck cadet, and operate as part of the crew, gaining hands-on experience as well as the opportunity to travel abroad to foreign ports; the average midshipman travels to eighteen countries during the three-hundred-day training period.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> This practical training results in an extended academic year that runs from late July to mid-June.\n\nToward the end of 1st class (senior) year, midshipmen prepare for [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] exams for a mandatory license as [[Third Assistant Engineer]] (steam and motor unlimited HP) or [[Third Mate]] (any gross tons, oceans).\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Merchant Marine Mariners}}\n[[File:Secretaries Cup (32783190664).jpg|thumb|Secretaries Cup Rivalry football game between the Merchant Marine Academy and [[Coast Guard Academy]]]]\nThe USMMA Mariners compete in [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] of the [[NCAA]], as a member of the [[Skyline Conference]] in all sports (men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, and track & field; women's sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, swimming & diving, track & field, and volleyball) except in football, where they are an associate member of the [[Liberty League]], and [[collegiate wrestling]], where they are a member of the [[Centennial Conference]].

The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art & Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].<ref>Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969).

E.g. \"The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects.\"</ref>\n \nThrough its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, \"conceptual art\" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].<ref name=tateconceptual>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm Turner Prize history: Conceptual art]\". Tate Gallery. tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006</ref> It could be said that one of the reasons why the term \"conceptual art\" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet \"conceptual\", it is not always entirely clear what \"concept\" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with \"intention\". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as \"conceptual\" with an artist's \"intention\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]\n[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art & Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]\nThe French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works \u2014 the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym \"R.Mutt\", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).<ref>\nTony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28\n</ref> The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future \"conceptualists\" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: \"All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually\".\n\nIn 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthap\u00e9riste'' (or \"infinite-aesthetics\"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] \u2013 quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Exco\u00f6rdism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\n\nIn 1961 the term \"concept art\", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}</ref> \nHowever, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social, philosophical, and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].<ref>[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}\n</ref>\n\n==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==\nConceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s \u2013 in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.<ref>Rorimer, p. 11</ref>\n\nSome have argued that conceptual art continued this \"dematerialization\" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,<ref>\nLucy Lippard & John Chandler, \"The Dematerialization of Art\", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218\n</ref>\nwhile others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.<ref>Rorimer, p. 12</ref>\nConceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: \"Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it.\" Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it\u2014emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the \"art\" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's \"written instructions\" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.\n\n[[Image:WeinerText.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Weiner]]. ''Bits & Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole,'' The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2005.]]\n\n==Language and/as art==\nLanguage was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |date=March 1 \u2013 June 1, 2008 |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art & Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.<ref>Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames & Hudson, 2001; p. 71</ref> Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, \"The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles.\"<ref name=\"Rorimer, p. 76\">Rorimer, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] \"reinforced and legitimized\" the direction the conceptual artists took.<ref>Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28</ref> Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.<ref>Osborne (2002), p. 28</ref> Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''<ref>http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf</ref> in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).\n\nThe American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who \"powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories.\" Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, \"The Construction of Change\" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages \u2013 a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).\n\n==Conceptual art and artistic skill==\n[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]\n\n<blockquote>\nBy adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art & Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials.<ref name=\"Rorimer, p. 76\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAn important difference between conceptual art and more \"traditional\" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramovi\u0107]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Contemporary influence==\nProto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of [[Modernism]] with, for example, [[Manet]] (1832\u20131883) and later [[Marcel Duchamp]] (1887\u20131968). The first wave of the \"conceptual art\" movement extended from approximately 1967<ref>\n[https://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art-history-and-concepts.htm#beginnings_header Conceptual Art] \u2013 \"In 1967, Sol LeWitt published ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' (considered by many to be the movement's manifesto) [...].\"\n</ref>\nto 1978. Early \"concept\" artists like [[Henry Flynt]] (1940\u2013 ), [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] (1931\u20132018), and [[Ray Johnson]] (1927\u20131995) influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well-known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled{{By whom|date=May 2019}} \"second- or third-generation\" conceptualists, or \"[[post-conceptual]]\" artists (the prefix Post- in art can frequently be interpreted as \"because of\").\n\nContemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement, while they may or may not term themselves \"conceptual artists\". Ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as [[art medium|medium]] continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Conceptual Art \u2013 The Art Story|url= http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website= theartstory.org|publisher= The Art Story Foundation|accessdate= 25 September 2014}}</ref>{{qn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Notable examples==\n[[Image:Iris Clert Portrait Rauschenberg.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Robert Rauschenberg]], ''Portrait of Iris Clert'' 1961]]\n[[Image:Give-if-you-can.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Jacek Tylicki]], Stone sculpture, ''Give If You Can \u2013 Take If You Have To''.

Flynt's \"concept art\" devolved from his idea of \"cognitive nihilism\" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.\n* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.\n* 1965: [[Art & Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''[[Mirror Piece]]''.

He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.\n* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.\n* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word \"chair\". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.\n* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art & Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966\u201367|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729181530/http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|archive-date=2017-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* 1966: [[N.E.

The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.\"\n* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.\n* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.<ref name=\"Byrt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.\n* 1969: The first issue of ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]'' is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art & Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the American editor.\n* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.\n* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]\u00b4s article \"Art after Philosophy\" in three parts (October\u2013December). It became the most discussed article on \"Conceptual Art\".\n* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art & Language]].<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like \"Camptown Races\" and \"Some Enchanted Evening\".\n* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.\n* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.\n* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted \"an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism\". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.\n* 1972: [[Art & Language|The Art & Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art & Language]] and text-works from [[Art-Language]]. \n* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.\n* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.\n* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.\n* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.\n* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.\n*1975\u201376: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art & Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art & Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.\n* 1975-77 [[Orshi Drozdik]]'s Individual Mythology performance, photography and offsetprint series and her theory of ImageBank in [[Budapest]].\n* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art & Language]] separate.

The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art & Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].<ref>Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969).

E.g. \"The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects.\"</ref>\n \nThrough its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, \"conceptual art\" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].<ref name=tateconceptual>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm Turner Prize history: Conceptual art]\". Tate Gallery. tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006</ref> It could be said that one of the reasons why the term \"conceptual art\" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet \"conceptual\", it is not always entirely clear what \"concept\" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with \"intention\". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as \"conceptual\" with an artist's \"intention\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]\n[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art & Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]\nThe French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works \u2014 the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym \"R.Mutt\", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).<ref>\nTony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28\n</ref> The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future \"conceptualists\" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: \"All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually\".\n\nIn 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthap\u00e9riste'' (or \"infinite-aesthetics\"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] \u2013 quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Exco\u00f6rdism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\n\nIn 1961 the term \"concept art\", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}</ref> \nHowever, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social, philosophical, and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].<ref>[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}\n</ref>\n\n==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==\nConceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s \u2013 in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.<ref>Rorimer, p. 11</ref>\n\nSome have argued that conceptual art continued this \"dematerialization\" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,<ref>\nLucy Lippard & John Chandler, \"The Dematerialization of Art\", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218\n</ref>\nwhile others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.<ref>Rorimer, p. 12</ref>\nConceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: \"Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it.\" Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it\u2014emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the \"art\" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's \"written instructions\" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.\n\n[[Image:WeinerText.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Weiner]]. ''Bits & Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole,'' The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2005.]]\n\n==Language and/as art==\nLanguage was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |date=March 1 \u2013 June 1, 2008 |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art & Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.<ref>Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames & Hudson, 2001; p. 71</ref> Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, \"The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles.\"<ref name=\"Rorimer, p. 76\">Rorimer, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] \"reinforced and legitimized\" the direction the conceptual artists took.<ref>Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28</ref> Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.<ref>Osborne (2002), p. 28</ref> Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''<ref>http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf</ref> in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).\n\nThe American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who \"powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories.\" Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, \"The Construction of Change\" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages \u2013 a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).\n\n==Conceptual art and artistic skill==\n[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]\n\n<blockquote>\nBy adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art & Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials.<ref name=\"Rorimer, p. 76\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAn important difference between conceptual art and more \"traditional\" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramovi\u0107]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Contemporary influence==\nProto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of [[Modernism]] with, for example, [[Manet]] (1832\u20131883) and later [[Marcel Duchamp]] (1887\u20131968). The first wave of the \"conceptual art\" movement extended from approximately 1967<ref>\n[https://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art-history-and-concepts.htm#beginnings_header Conceptual Art] \u2013 \"In 1967, Sol LeWitt published ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' (considered by many to be the movement's manifesto) [...].\"\n</ref>\nto 1978. Early \"concept\" artists like [[Henry Flynt]] (1940\u2013 ), [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] (1931\u20132018), and [[Ray Johnson]] (1927\u20131995) influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well-known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled{{By whom|date=May 2019}} \"second- or third-generation\" conceptualists, or \"[[post-conceptual]]\" artists (the prefix Post- in art can frequently be interpreted as \"because of\").\n\nContemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement, while they may or may not term themselves \"conceptual artists\". Ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as [[art medium|medium]] continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Conceptual Art \u2013 The Art Story|url= http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website= theartstory.org|publisher= The Art Story Foundation|accessdate= 25 September 2014}}</ref>{{qn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Notable examples==\n[[Image:Iris Clert Portrait Rauschenberg.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Robert Rauschenberg]], ''Portrait of Iris Clert'' 1961]]\n[[Image:Give-if-you-can.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Jacek Tylicki]], Stone sculpture, ''Give If You Can \u2013 Take If You Have To''.

''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's \"concept art\" devolved from his idea of \"cognitive nihilism\" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.\n* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.\n* 1965: [[Art & Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''[[Mirror Piece]]''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.<ref>{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art & Language \u2013 Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}</ref>\n* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.\n* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.\n* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word \"chair\". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.\n* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art & Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966\u201367|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729181530/http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|archive-date=2017-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* 1966: [[N.E.

The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.\"\n* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.\n* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.<ref name=\"Byrt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.\n* 1969: The first issue of ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]'' is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art & Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the American editor.\n* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.\n* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]\u00b4s article \"Art after Philosophy\" in three parts (October\u2013December). It became the most discussed article on \"Conceptual Art\".\n* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art & Language]].<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like \"Camptown Races\" and \"Some Enchanted Evening\".\n* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.\n* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.\n* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted \"an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism\". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.\n* 1972: [[Art & Language|The Art & Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art & Language]] and text-works from [[Art-Language]]. \n* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.\n* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.\n* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.\n* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.\n* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.\n*1975\u201376: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art & Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art & Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.\n* 1975-77 [[Orshi Drozdik]]'s Individual Mythology performance, photography and offsetprint series and her theory of ImageBank in [[Budapest]].\n* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art & Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art & Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.\n* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters.

The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields. [[Gas venting]] and [[production flaring]] are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=1532 |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Zero_Routine_Flaring_by_2030 |title=UN Climate Initiatives Platform - Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref>  Unwanted gas (or [[stranded gas reserve|stranded gas]] without a market)  is often returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re-pressurize the formation, which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells. In regions with a high natural gas demand (such as the US), [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an [[end consumer]].\n\nIn addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as [[LNG|liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via [[gas to liquids]] (GTL) technologies.

A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (F\u2013T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and [[syngas to gasoline plus]] (STG+). F\u2013T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas.

Sources of biogas include [[swamp]]s, [[marsh]]es, and [[landfill]]s, as well as [[agricultural waste]] materials such as [[sewage]] [[sludge]] and [[manure]] by way of [[anaerobic digester]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/manure-management-and-air-quality/manure-treatment/docs/anaerobic-digestion-overview.pdf |author=David Schmidt |title=Anaerobic Digestion Overview |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2017-11-19}}</ref> in addition to [[enteric fermentation]], particularly in [[cattle]]. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.\n\nBiogas, and especially landfill gas, are already used in some areas, but their use could be greatly expanded. Systems have been established for use in parts of [[Hertfordshire]], UK <ref>{{cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/biogen-opens-45-000-tpa-food-waste-to-biogas-plant-in-hertfordshire-uk|title= Biogen Opens 45,000 TPA Food Waste to Biogas Plant in Hertfordshire, UK}}</ref> and [[Lyon]] in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://energy-cities.eu/best-practice/biogas-co-generation-in-a-greenhouse-complex/|title=Biogas co-generation in a greenhouse complex}}</ref> Using materials that would otherwise generate no income, or even cost money to get rid of, improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production.

Many [[List of natural gas pipelines#North America|existing pipelines in America]] are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages.

In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns.

Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|\"supergiant\" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}.

The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields. [[Gas venting]] and [[production flaring]] are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=1532 |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Zero_Routine_Flaring_by_2030 |title=UN Climate Initiatives Platform - Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref>  Unwanted gas (or [[stranded gas reserve|stranded gas]] without a market)  is often returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re-pressurize the formation, which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells.

GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (F\u2013T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and [[syngas to gasoline plus]] (STG+). F\u2013T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas.

The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the [[Natural gas processing|gas plant]] is to collect this condensate.

It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbons]], together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\n\nMost town \"gashouses\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\n\n===Biogas===\n{{Main|Biogas}}\n[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Bj\u00f6rkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473\u2013478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops.

Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations.

The high pressure water breaks up or \"fracks\" the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the \"frack,\" oil or gas is extracted and 30\u201370% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells.

In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. [[Carbon monoxide detector|Detectors]] are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).<ref>US Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Research-and-Statistics/Injury-Statistics/Carbon-Monoxide-Posioning/NonFireCarbonMonoxideDeathsAssociatedwiththeUseofConsumerProducts2011AnnualEstimatesSept2014.pdf Non-Fire Carbon Monoxide Deaths, 2011 Annual Estimate], September 2014.</ref>\n\n==Energy content, statistics, and pricing==\n{{Main|Natural gas prices}}\n{{see also|Billion cubic metres of natural gas}}\n[[File:Henry hub NG prices.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Natural gas prices]] at the [[Henry Hub]] in US dollars per million BTUs]]\n[[File:Natural Gas Price Comparison.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison of natural gas prices in Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, 2007\u20132011]]\n\nQuantities of natural gas are measured in [[normal cubic meter]]s (cubic meter of gas at \"normal\" temperature {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}) or [[Standard cubic foot|standard cubic feet]] (cubic foot of gas at \"standard\" temperature {{convert|60.0|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|14.73|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}), {{convert|1|m3|cuft|4|spell=in|sp=us|disp=x|&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;}}.

Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|\"supergiant\" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}. It was also reported that the gas field could hold a potential {{convert|30|e12cuft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas. ENI said that the energy is about{{convert|5.5|e9BOE|abbr=~}}. The field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNN Money |date=30 August 2015 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/30/news/companies/eni-gas-field/ |title=Natural gas discovery could be largest ever |first=David |last=Goldman}}</ref>\n\n==Natural gas as an asset class for institutional investors==\nResearch conducted by the [[World Pensions Council]] (WPC){{when|date=March 2014}} suggests that large US and Canadian pension funds and Asian and [[MENA]] area [[Sovereign wealth fund|SWF]] investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, a trend started in 2005 by the formation of [[Scotia Gas Networks]] in the UK by [[OMERS]] and [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)==\nNatural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressures up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) will yield greater storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC), primarily in three forms: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), activated carbon monolith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang|title=Adsorbed Natural Gas|work=scopeWe \u2013 a Virtual Engineer|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109181802/http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Renewable energy}}\n* [[Associated petroleum gas]]\n* [[Gas oil ratio]]\n* [[Natural gas by country]]\n* [[Peak gas]]\n* [[Power to gas]]\n* [[Renewable natural gas]]\n* [[Thiols]] universally used as the added odorant, mercaptan, to give a foul odor safety signal when gas leaks occur\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mitei.mit.edu/publications/reports-studies/future-natural-gas The future of Natural Gas MIT study]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2341738 A Comparison between Shale Gas in China and Unconventional Fuel Development in the United States: Health, Water and Environmental Risks] by Paolo Farah and Riccardo Tremolada.

The trail closely approximates the route that [[Paul Revere]] took on his famous ride in 1775, which heralded the beginning of the American Revolution.\n\nAlong the way to becoming a railroad, the path's [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] was laid out east of Lexington in 1846 by the [[Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad]] and west of Lexington in 1873 by the [[Middlesex Central Railroad]].\n\n[[Railbanking]] of the line was first proposed in 1974, three years before passenger rail service was discontinued, and a full seven years before rail service was discontinued altogether (in 1981). In 1991, the final plan for the conversion was approved, and construction started on the original section of the bikeway. The path was dedicated in 1992 and completed the following year.<ref name=\"viser2007\"/>\n\nIn 1998 the bikeway was extended from East Arlington to Alewife station (in Cambridge).

The trail closely approximates the route that [[Paul Revere]] took on his famous ride in 1775, which heralded the beginning of the American Revolution.\n\nAlong the way to becoming a railroad, the path's [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] was laid out east of Lexington in 1846 by the [[Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad]] and west of Lexington in 1873 by the [[Middlesex Central Railroad]].\n\n[[Railbanking]] of the line was first proposed in 1974, three years before passenger rail service was discontinued, and a full seven years before rail service was discontinued altogether (in 1981). In 1991, the final plan for the conversion was approved, and construction started on the original section of the bikeway. The path was dedicated in 1992 and completed the following year.<ref name=\"viser2007\"/>\n\nIn 1998 the bikeway was extended from East Arlington to Alewife station (in Cambridge). In 2002 it was repaved in Arlington and in 2004 the Bedford Depot Park Enhancement Project was completed at its western terminus.<ref name=\"viser2007\">Viser, Matt (2007), \"Rage on the bikeway\", The Boston Globe, Volume 272, Number 1, 2007-07-01, p.A1.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the bikeway was the fifth inductee into the national Rail-Trail Hall of Fame by the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minutemanbikeway.org/Pages/HallofFame.html|title=Bikeway-Hall of Fame|website=www.minutemanbikeway.org}}</ref>\n\nThe property is currently owned by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] and leased to the municipalities through which it passes on an interim basis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The MBTA at one point planned to use this right-of-way to extend the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] to Arlington Center and Arlington Heights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/the-red-line-stops-in-arlington-and-lexington.php|title=The Red Line Stops in Arlington and Lexington|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in Spring 2015, the crossing of the path through Arlington Center is expected to be rebuilt to be less discontinuous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=22444|title=Project Update: September 25, 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=2932 Map of Preferred Alternative] - Arlington Center Safe Travel Project, March 21, 2013</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nArea residents use the bikeway for a host of activities, including [[cycling|bicycling]], walking, [[jogging]], and [[inline skates|inline skating]].

[[Bahrain]] (''[[National Assembly (Bahrain)|Majlis al Watani]]'') and [[Kuwait]] (''[[National Assembly (Kuwait)|Majlis al Ummah]]'') have legislatures with members elected by the population.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman also has an advisory council (''Majlis ash-Shura'') that is popularly elected. In the UAE, a federation of seven monarchical emirates, the [[Federal National Council (United Arab Emirates)]] functions only as an advisory body, but some of its members are now chosen via a limited [[electoral college]] nominated by the seven rulers. Saudi Arabia remains a [[hereditary monarchy]] with limited political representation. In Qatar, an elected national parliament has been mooted and is written into the new constitution, but elections are yet to be held.<ref>Gerd Nonneman, \"Political Reform in the Gulf Monarchies: From Liberalisation to Democratisation?

The Bohemian border with [[Bavaria]] was inhabited primarily by Germans. The [[Upper Palatine Forest]], which extends along the Bavarian frontier and into the agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]], was an area of German settlement. [[Moravia]] contained patches of \"locked\" German territory to the north and south. More characteristic were the German [[language island]]s, which were towns inhabited by German minorities and surrounded by Czechs. Sudeten Germans were mostly [[Roman Catholics]], a legacy of centuries of [[Austrian Habsburg]] rule.\n\nNot all ethnic Germans lived in isolated and well-defined areas; for historical reasons, Czechs and Germans mixed in many places, and Czech-German bilingualism was quite common. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century, Czechs and Germans began to create separate cultural, educational, political and economic institutions, which kept both groups semiisolated from each other. That form of separation continued until the end of the Second World War, when almost all Germans were expelled.\n\n[[File:Sudetendeutsche.png|thumb|200px|right|Czech districts by ethnic German population in 1930:<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 I.

With the rise of the Habsburgs in Bohemia after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], the old [[Bohemian nobility]] became virtually meaningless.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Increasingly, the Bohemian crown lands were ruled from the Austrian capital, [[Vienna]], which favoured the dominance of the [[German language]] and [[German culture]].<ref>Manfred Alexander: ''Kleine Geschichte der b\u00f6hmischen L\u00e4nder,'' Reclam, Stuttgart 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-15-010655-6}}.</ref> On the other hand, the 18th-century [[Silesian Wars]] started by Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] against Austria resulted in the loss of the traditionally-Bohemian crown land and weakened Germans in the remaining parts of Bohemia. As the 19th century arrived, resistance to the German domination began to develop among the Czechs.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:Brockhaus 1894 Deutsche Mundarten.jpg|thumbnail|German dialects with overlaps to Sudeten]]\nAfter the [[revolutions of 1848]] and the rise of [[ethnic nationalism]], nervousness about ethnic tensions in [[Austria-Hungary]] resulted in a prevailing equality between [[Czechs]] and German Bohemians.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://alex.onb.ac.at|title=ALEX - Historische Rechts- und Gesetzestexte|first=\u00d6sterreichische|last=Nationalbibliothek|date=|website=alex.onb.ac.at|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Each ethnicity tried to retain, in regions in which it was the majority, sovereignty over its own affairs. Czechs and Germans generally maintained separate schools, churches and public institutions.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Nevertheless, despite the separation, Germans often undersood some Czech, and Czechs often spoke some German. Cities like Prague, however, saw more mixing between the ethnicities and also had large populations of [[Jews]]. Jews in Bohemia often spoke German and sometimes [[Yiddish]]. The famed writer [[Franz Kafka]] exemplifies the diversity of Bohemia since he was a German-speaking Prague-based Jew, but his surname was of Czech origin.<ref>Brod, Max (1960).

The agreement established the Dual Monarchy and gave the [[Hungarians]] sovereignty over their own affairs. The preservation of German cultural dominance throughout [[Cisleithania]] had proved to be difficult and now seemed to be was utterly impossible.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nWith the agreement, the desire for an autonomous Czech subdivision was mounting. Both German Bohemians and Czechs were hoping for a constitutional solution to the demands, but Czech nationalist views remained a constant part of the Bohemian political sphere. The Czechs had feared [[Germanization]], but the Germans now worried about [[Czechization]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Otto | last = Urban | title = Czech Society 1848\u20131918 | chapter =V. | isbn = 0-521-43155-7 | url = http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/ | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = United Kingdom | year = 1998 | accessdate = 25 February 2013}}''''''\n</ref>\n\nA symbol of the rising tensions was the fate of Charles University, then called [[Charles-Ferdinand University]]. Its Czech students had become increasingly perturbed by the sole use of German for instruction.

By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. The Cisleithanian Imperial Council prepared an act of parliament, and the emperor granted [[royal assent]] on 28 February 1882.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t73.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = X.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909. German Bohemia, as it was to be called, was going to be separated from the Czech areas around it in the plan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_B\u00f6.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}\n</ref> That would create ethnically-homogenous self-governing provinces that would hopefully end the ethnic conflict. However, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand was assassinated]], and the [[First World War]] destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\n==Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye==\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] into its historical components, one of them, the [[Bohemian Kingdom]], forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].'''\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn|Tetschen-Bodenbach/D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], [[\u017datec|Saaz/\u017datec]] and [[Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch|Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch/Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl im Adlergebirge]] on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the [[German language]] for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club. Although the Social Democrats continued to champion democratic freedoms, the masses supported the SdP.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies (1920\u20131935)===\nThe table below shows the number of seats German parties and German\u2013Hungarian lists gained in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies between 1920 and 1935.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Party or List<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116 du 18 Mai 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/T80IHC,1,0,Republik_unter_Druck.html|title=Republik unter Druck - bpb|first=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische|last=Bildung|date=|website=www.bpb.de|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n!Seats 1920\n!Seats 1925\n!Seats 1929\n!Seats 1935\n!Votes 1935\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German Party]]\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|44\n|1.256.010\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German National Party]]\n| -\n|10\n|7\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German National Socialist Party|German National Socialist Workers Party]]\n|15\n|17\n|8\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|German Social Democratic Workers Party]]\n|31\n|17\n|21\n|11\n|300.406\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Christian Social People's Party]]\n|7\n|13\n|14\n|6\n|163.666\n|- align=\"center\"\n|German Union of Farmers\n|11\n|24\n| -\n|5\n|142.775\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc\n|9\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|292.847\n|- align=\"center\"\n|United German Parties\n|6\n| -\n|16\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|'''Total (out of 300 seats)'''\n|79\n|85\n|75\n|75\n|\n|}\n\n* <small>Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc (1935): German Democratic Liberal Party, German Industrialist Party, Party of German Nation, Sudeten German Land Union, German Workers Party, Zips German Party, Provincial Christian Social Party, Hungarian National Party<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116, May 18, 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref></small>\n\n==Munich Agreements==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unsmiling, [[Neville Chamberlain]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] leave the Bad Godesberg meeting on 23 September 1938.]]\n[[File:Konrad Henlein v Karlov\u00fdch Varech 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Henlein speaking in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], 1937]]\n[[File:Teroristick\u00e1 akce sudeton\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Freikorpsu.jpg|thumb|right|A 1938 terrorist action of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Voluntary Force]]]]\n[[Image:SN zamaz\u00e1vaj\u00ed \u010desk\u00fd n\u00e1zev \u0160umperk.gif|250px|thumb|right|In [[\u0160umperk|\u0160umperk-M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg]], Czech names were erased by the Sudeten Germans after the German annexation of [[Sudetenland]] in 1938.]]\n[[Konrad Henlein]] met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938 and was tolf to raise demands that would be unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September.

In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches.

Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the [[Hussite Wars]], the occupation of Bohemia by the [[Czech Brethren]], the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]], when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. With the rise of the Habsburgs in Bohemia after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], the old [[Bohemian nobility]] became virtually meaningless.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Increasingly, the Bohemian crown lands were ruled from the Austrian capital, [[Vienna]], which favoured the dominance of the [[German language]] and [[German culture]].<ref>Manfred Alexander: ''Kleine Geschichte der b\u00f6hmischen L\u00e4nder,'' Reclam, Stuttgart 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-15-010655-6}}.</ref> On the other hand, the 18th-century [[Silesian Wars]] started by Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] against Austria resulted in the loss of the traditionally-Bohemian crown land and weakened Germans in the remaining parts of Bohemia. As the 19th century arrived, resistance to the German domination began to develop among the Czechs.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:Brockhaus 1894 Deutsche Mundarten.jpg|thumbnail|German dialects with overlaps to Sudeten]]\nAfter the [[revolutions of 1848]] and the rise of [[ethnic nationalism]], nervousness about ethnic tensions in [[Austria-Hungary]] resulted in a prevailing equality between [[Czechs]] and German Bohemians.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://alex.onb.ac.at|title=ALEX - Historische Rechts- und Gesetzestexte|first=\u00d6sterreichische|last=Nationalbibliothek|date=|website=alex.onb.ac.at|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Each ethnicity tried to retain, in regions in which it was the majority, sovereignty over its own affairs. Czechs and Germans generally maintained separate schools, churches and public institutions.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Nevertheless, despite the separation, Germans often undersood some Czech, and Czechs often spoke some German. Cities like Prague, however, saw more mixing between the ethnicities and also had large populations of [[Jews]]. Jews in Bohemia often spoke German and sometimes [[Yiddish]]. The famed writer [[Franz Kafka]] exemplifies the diversity of Bohemia since he was a German-speaking Prague-based Jew, but his surname was of Czech origin.<ref>Brod, Max (1960). ''Franz Kafka: A Biography''. New York: Schocken Books. {{ISBN|978-0-8052-0047-8}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1867, the equality of Austrian citizens of all ethnicities was guaranteed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which enshrined the principles of [[constitutional monarchy]]. The agreement established the Dual Monarchy and gave the [[Hungarians]] sovereignty over their own affairs. The preservation of German cultural dominance throughout [[Cisleithania]] had proved to be difficult and now seemed to be was utterly impossible.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nWith the agreement, the desire for an autonomous Czech subdivision was mounting. Both German Bohemians and Czechs were hoping for a constitutional solution to the demands, but Czech nationalist views remained a constant part of the Bohemian political sphere. The Czechs had feared [[Germanization]], but the Germans now worried about [[Czechization]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Otto | last = Urban | title = Czech Society 1848\u20131918 | chapter =V. | isbn = 0-521-43155-7 | url = http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/ | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = United Kingdom | year = 1998 | accessdate = 25 February 2013}}\n</ref>\n\nA symbol of the rising tensions was the fate of Charles University, then called [[Charles-Ferdinand University]]. Its Czech students had become increasingly perturbed by the sole use of German for instruction. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|1848 revolution]], both Germans and Czechs fought to make Czech one of the university's official languages.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuni.cz/UKEN-106.html|title=History of Charles University|author=|date=|website=cuni.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> They achieved that right, and the university became bilingual. By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. The Cisleithanian Imperial Council prepared an act of parliament, and the emperor granted [[royal assent]] on 28 February 1882.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t73.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = X.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909. German Bohemia, as it was to be called, was going to be separated from the Czech areas around it in the plan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_B\u00f6.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}\n</ref> That would create ethnically-homogenous self-governing provinces that would hopefully end the ethnic conflict. However, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand was assassinated]], and the [[First World War]] destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\n==Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye==\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] into its historical components, one of them, the [[Bohemian Kingdom]], forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn|Tetschen-Bodenbach/D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], [[\u017datec|Saaz/\u017datec]] and [[Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch|Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch/Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl im Adlergebirge]] on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the [[German language]] for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club. Although the Social Democrats continued to champion democratic freedoms, the masses supported the SdP.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies (1920\u20131935)===\nThe table below shows the number of seats German parties and German\u2013Hungarian lists gained in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies between 1920 and 1935.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Party or List<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116 du 18 Mai 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/T80IHC,1,0,Republik_unter_Druck.html|title=Republik unter Druck - bpb|first=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische|last=Bildung|date=|website=www.bpb.de|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n!Seats 1920\n!Seats 1925\n!Seats 1929\n!Seats 1935\n!Votes 1935\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German Party]]\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|44\n|1.256.010\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German National Party]]\n| -\n|10\n|7\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German National Socialist Party|German National Socialist Workers Party]]\n|15\n|17\n|8\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|German Social Democratic Workers Party]]\n|31\n|17\n|21\n|11\n|300.406\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Christian Social People's Party]]\n|7\n|13\n|14\n|6\n|163.666\n|- align=\"center\"\n|German Union of Farmers\n|11\n|24\n| -\n|5\n|142.775\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc\n|9\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|292.847\n|- align=\"center\"\n|United German Parties\n|6\n| -\n|16\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|'''Total (out of 300 seats)'''\n|79\n|85\n|75\n|75\n|\n|}\n\n* <small>Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc (1935): German Democratic Liberal Party, German Industrialist Party, Party of German Nation, Sudeten German Land Union, German Workers Party, Zips German Party, Provincial Christian Social Party, Hungarian National Party<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116, May 18, 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref></small>\n\n==Munich Agreements==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unsmiling, [[Neville Chamberlain]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] leave the Bad Godesberg meeting on 23 September 1938.]]\n[[File:Konrad Henlein v Karlov\u00fdch Varech 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Henlein speaking in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], 1937]]\n[[File:Teroristick\u00e1 akce sudeton\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Freikorpsu.jpg|thumb|right|A 1938 terrorist action of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Voluntary Force]]]]\n[[Image:SN zamaz\u00e1vaj\u00ed \u010desk\u00fd n\u00e1zev \u0160umperk.gif|250px|thumb|right|In [[\u0160umperk|\u0160umperk-M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg]], Czech names were erased by the Sudeten Germans after the German annexation of [[Sudetenland]] in 1938.]]\n[[Konrad Henlein]] met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938 and was tolf to raise demands that would be unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The [[Munich Agreement]], signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the [[\u0160koda Works]]; near [[Pilsen]], they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65&nbsp;million inhabitants (2.82&nbsp;million Germans<ref name=\"bruntal.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141202131759/http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |archive-date=2014-12-02 |df= }}</ref> and approximately 513,000 - 750,000<ref name=\"bruntal.net\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohumildolezal.cz/texty/u074-08.htm|title=Fakta o vyhn\u00e1n\u00ed \u010cech\u016f ze Sudet|first=Bohumil|last=Dole\u017eal|date=|website=www.bohumildolezal.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Czechs to Germany).\n\n==Under Nazi rule==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13160, Beim Einmarsch deutscher Truppen in Eger.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sudeten Germans greeting Hitler with the [[Nazi salute]] after he crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in 1938.]]\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] under German governors and the German Army.  Almost all the Germans in these Czech territories were subsequently granted German citizenship,<ref>Smlouva mezi \u010cesko-Slovenskou republikou a N\u011bmeckou \u0159\u00ed\u0161\u00ed o ot\u00e1zk\u00e1ch st\u00e1tn\u00edho ob\u010danstv\u00ed a opce, law no. 300/1938 Sb.</ref> while most of the Germans in Slovakia obtained citizenship of the [[Slovak state]].\n\nWith the establishment of German rule, hundreds of thousands of Czechs who (under the policy of Czechification) had moved into the Sudetenland after 1919 left the area, some willingly. They were, however, permitted to take away their possessions and to legally sell their houses and land.

About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]], which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in [[Nazi Germany]] was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the [[Gestapo]]. The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]], the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, almost all [[Czechoslovak Jews]], most of whom were primarily German-speaking were [[Holocaust|deported and murdered]] the authorities.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (''Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln'') and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.  After the beginning of the [[Slovak National uprising]] in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in ''Heimatschutz'', an equivalent of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in Germany.  The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews.<ref>Littlejohn, David: ''Foreign Legions of the Third Reich''. 1994</ref>  The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the [[Sudetenland]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]].<ref name=\"zimmermann\"/>\n\n==Expulsion and transfer==\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Germans expelled from Bohemia and Moravia after the Second World War]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out.  In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions.<ref>Biman, S. - C\u00edlek, R.: ''Posledn\u00ed mrtv\u00ed, prvn\u00ed \u017eiv\u00ed''. \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem 1989. ({{ISBN|807047002X}})</ref> Several thousand Germans were murdered during the expulsion, and many more died from hunger and illness as a consequence of becoming refugees.\n\nThe regular transfer of ethnic nationals among nations, authorized according to the [[Potsdam Conference]], proceeded from 25 January 1946 until October 1946. An estimated 1.6&nbsp;million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American zone]] of what would become [[West Germany]]. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the [[Soviet zone]] (in what would become [[East Germany]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/65421|title=Memories of World War II in the Czech Lands: the expulsion of Sudeten Germans - Radio Prague|author=|date=|website=radio.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Estimates of casualties related to this expulsion range between 20,000 and 200,000 people, depending on source.<ref name = \"Time\">P.
