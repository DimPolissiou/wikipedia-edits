During all these years of political activities he was imprisoned many times: 1964 by the King Zahir Shah's regime \"because\" of organizing and leading a massive manifestation of student, scholars and regular folks in Kabul. In 1969 he was arrested \"because\" of subversive political activities by the same system. In 1975 by the President Daud's regime, a highly conservative ruler supposed by the leftist, \"because\" of political resistance, and finally in 1978 by the leftist regime of Muhammad Taraki.\n\nIn 1978 he was arrested by the secret service of the [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|Muhammad Taraki]] government.

The lack of serious academic studies on his legacy is remarkable. This epistemic void might be caused by different factors.

Why Taher Badakhshi, because there is today, under the current circumstances in Afghanistan, and because of the peculiar conditions there, an urgent need to do so, to recapitulate and to revise his ideas, communications and actions from the 1960s until his violent disappearance in 1979.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/taher.badakhshi.94|title=Taher Badakhshi|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe main political background was built by third world freedom movements like in Vietnam, Palestine, or African anti-colonial fights and it was orientated on [[Non-Aligned Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/non-aligned-movement-nam/ |title= Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{!}} Treaties & Regimes {{!}} NTI |website= www.nti.org |access-date= 2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://mea.gov.in/in-focus-article.htm?20349/History+and+Evolution+of+NonAligned+Movement |title= History and Evolution of Non-Aligned Movement |website= mea.gov.in |language=en |access-date= 2017-12-01}}</ref> The political activities between 1965 and 1978 were mainly focussed on basic reformative goals toward a liberal (republican and democratic) system in which basic human rights of all inhabitants of the country, independent of their ethnic or economic background, would be respected. A special regard was concentrated on the obvious and objective antagonism of ethnic disparity and inequality in favour of Pashtuns and, in evident disfavor of other ethnic groups as they are Uzbeks, Hazaras and to some extent even Tajiks. Activities were directed against the Pashtun ethnic-dominance and elitism in relevant fields of politics, finance, military, police; asking for equal rights of all other ethnicities in Afghanistan. The political organization he led was labeled as ''Setami Milli'' (National Oppression) by the royal family and, at the same time, by the \"leftist\" functionaries, mainly by Pashtun activists of the \"People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan\". He came because of his opposition to the system into political detention many times in his life, for days, weeks or multiple months: during the times of King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], during the first republic of Muhammad Daoud. In the meantime, he worked in the Ministry of Education, where he kept working during the regime of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] after the leftist coup d \u00e9tat in April 1978 too. His cultural work and productivity in terms of writing multiple newspapers, journals and magazines on poetry, prose, philosophy and theology had been documented well, but mostly got lost in the years of the war that came after 1980.

A special regard was concentrated on the obvious and objective antagonism of ethnic disparity and inequality in favour of Pashtuns and, in evident disfavor of other ethnic groups as they are Uzbeks, Hazaras and to some extent even Tajiks. Activities were directed against the Pashtun ethnic-dominance and elitism in relevant fields of politics, finance, military, police; asking for equal rights of all other ethnicities in Afghanistan. The political organization he led was labeled as ''Setami Milli'' (National Oppression) by the royal family and, at the same time, by the \"leftist\" functionaries, mainly by Pashtun activists of the \"People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan\". He came because of his opposition to the system into political detention many times in his life, for days, weeks or multiple months: during the times of King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], during the first republic of Muhammad Daoud. In the meantime, he worked in the Ministry of Education, where he kept working during the regime of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] after the leftist coup d \u00e9tat in April 1978 too.

The first commercial communications satellite was [[Telstar|Telstar 1]], built by [[Bell Labs]] and launched in July 1962.\nWhy we use satellite internet?\nif we are in rural areas and we don't get too high-speed internet because of this we unable to grow fast with our internet.\n\nif we want to solve this problem with an ethernet cable and the internet cable like fibre optics cable than we need to spend more money In our network. so we use the satellite internet to getting high-speed internet for our needs. for satellite internet, we need a satellite dish and modems\n\nSatellite internet is very simple in this intent our computer sends a request through our modems and it sends the signs lt through the dish to satellite and satellite returns the signal back through the dish to modems then finally the computer.\n[https://www.newtechnetworks.com/2020/02/satellite-internet.html Read more about satellite]\n\nThe idea of a [[geosynchronous satellite]]\u2014one that could orbit the Earth above the equator and remain fixed by following the Earth's rotation\u2014was first proposed by [[Herman Poto\u010dnik]] in 1928 and popularised by the [[science fiction author]] [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in a paper in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Arthur C.

Succeeding generations of communications satellites featuring larger capacities and improved performance characteristics were adopted for use in television delivery, military applications and telecommunications purposes. Following the invention of the [[Internet]] and the World Wide Web, geostationary satellites attracted interest as a potential means of providing Internet access.\n\nA significant enabler of satellite-delivered Internet has been the opening up of the {{Ka band}} for satellites. In December 1993, Hughes Aircraft Co. filed with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for a license to launch the first K<sub>a</sub>-band satellite, [[Spaceway]]. In 1995, the FCC issued a call for more K<sub>a</sub>-band satellite applications, attracting applications from 15 companies. Among those were [[EchoStar]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[SES Americom|GE-Americom]], [[Motorola]] and KaStar Satellite, which later became [[WildBlue]].\n\nAmong prominent aspirants in the early-stage satellite Internet sector was [[Teledesic]], an ambitious and ultimately failed project funded in part by [[Microsoft]] that ended up costing more than $9 billion. Teledesic's idea was to create a [[broadband]] [[satellite constellation]] of hundreds of low-orbiting satellites in the K<sub>a</sub>-band frequency, providing inexpensive Internet access with download speeds of up to 720 Mbit/s. The project was abandoned in 2003. Teledesic's failure, coupled with the bankruptcy filings of the satellite communications providers [[Iridium Communications Inc.]] and [[Globalstar]], dampened marketplace enthusiasm for satellite Internet development. It wasn't until September 2003 when the first Internet-ready satellite for consumers was launched by Eutelsat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/satellite-biz-03zza.html |title=First Internet Ready Satellite Launched |publisher=Space Daily |date=2003-09-29 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, with the launch of [[Anik (satellite)#Anik F2|Anik F2]], the first [[high throughput satellite]], a class of next-generation satellites providing improved capacity and bandwidth became operational. More recently, high throughput satellites such as ViaSat's ViaSat-1 satellite in 2011 and HughesNet's Jupiter in 2012 have achieved further improvements, elevating downstream data rates from 1\u20133 Mbit/s up to 12\u201315Mbit/s and beyond.

Other components of a satellite Internet system include a [[modem]] at the user end which links the user's network with the transceiver, and a centralized [[network operations center]] (NOC) for monitoring the entire system.  Working in concert with a broadband gateway, the satellite operates a [[Star network]] topology where all network communication passes through the network's hub processor, which is at the center of the star. With this configuration, the number of remote VSATs that can be connected to the hub is virtually limitless.\n\n===Satellite===\nMarketed as the center of the new broadband satellite networks are a new generation of high-powered GEO satellites positioned {{convert|35786|km|mi}} above the equator, operating in K<sub>a</sub>-band (18.3\u201330&nbsp;GHz) mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/ka-band-permitted-space-station-list |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421053243/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/ka-band-permitted-space-station-list |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-21 |title=Ka-band Permitted Space Station List |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2013-08-29 }}</ref> These new purpose-built satellites are designed and optimized for broadband applications, employing many narrow spot beams,<ref>http://www.dbsinstall.com/PDF/WildBlue/Wildblue_Satellite_Basics.pdf</ref> which target a much smaller area than the broad beams used by earlier communication satellites. This spot beam technology allows satellites to reuse assigned bandwidth multiple times which can enable them to achieve much higher overall capacity than conventional broad beam satellites. The spot beams can also increase performance and consequential capacity by focusing more power and increased receiver sensitivity into defined concentrated areas. Spot beams are designated as one of two types: subscriber spot beams, which transmit to and from the subscriber-side terminal, and gateway spot beams, which transmit to/from a service provider ground station. Note that moving off the tight footprint of a spotbeam can degrade performance significantly. Also, spotbeams can make the use of other significant new technologies impossible, including 'Carrier in [[Carrier wave|Carrier]]' modulation.\n\nIn conjunction with the satellite's spot-beam technology, a [[Transponder (satellite communications)|bent-pipe]] architecture has traditionally been employed in the network in which the satellite functions as a bridge in space, connecting two communication points on the ground. The term \"bent-pipe\" is used to describe the shape of the data path between sending and receiving antennas, with the satellite positioned at the point of the bend.\nSimply put, the satellite's role in this network arrangement is to relay signals from the end user's terminal to the ISP's gateways, and back again without processing the signal at the satellite. The satellite receives, amplifies, and redirects a carrier on a specific radio frequency through a signal path called a transponder.<ref name=\"howsatcomworks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vsat-systems.com/satellite-internet/how-it-works.html |title=How broadband satellite Internet works |publisher=VSAT Systems |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\nSome proposed [[satellite constellation|satellite constellations]] in LEO such as [[Starlink]], [[Telesat]] constellation and [[LeoSat]] will employ [[laser communication in space|laser communication]] equipment for high-throughput optical inter-satellite links. The interconnected satellites allow for direct routing of user data from satellite to satellite and effectively create a space-based [[optical mesh network]] that will enable seamless network management and continuity of service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elon Musk is about to launch the first of 11,925 proposed SpaceX internet satellites \u2014 more than all spacecraft that orbit Earth today|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-microsat-launch-global-internet-2018-2?r=US&IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe satellite has its own set of antennas to receive communication signals from Earth and to transmit signals to their target location. These antennas and transponders are part of the satellite's \"payload\", which is designed to receive and transmit signals to and from various places on Earth. What enables this transmission and reception in the payload transponders is a repeater subsystem (RF (radio frequency) equipment) used to change frequencies, filter, separate, amplify and group signals before routing them to their destination address on Earth. The satellite's high-gain receiving antenna passes the transmitted data to the transponder which filters, translates and amplifies them, then redirects them to the transmitting antenna on board. The signal is then routed to a specific ground location through a channel known as a carrier. Beside the payload, the other main component of a communications satellite is called the bus, which comprises all equipment required to move the satellite into position, supply power, regulate equipment temperatures, provide health and tracking information, and perform numerous other operational tasks.<ref name=\"howsatcomworks\" />\n\n===Gateways===\nAlong with dramatic advances in satellite technology over the past decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.\nThe [[Gateway (telecommunications)|Gateway]]\u2014or Gateway Earth Station (its full name)\u2014is also referred to as a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components.  \nIn short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.\nThe system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for subscriber terminal connections to the Internet.\nIn the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the gateway antenna can stay pointed at a fixed position.\n\n===Antenna dish and modem===\nFor the customer-provided equipment (i.e. PC and router) to access the broadband satellite network, the customer must have additional physical components installed:\n\n====Outdoor unit (ODU)====\nAt the far end of the outdoor unit is typically a small (2\u20133-foot, 60-90cm diameter), reflective dish-type radio antenna. The VSAT antenna must also have an unobstructed view of the sky to allow for proper [[Sightline|line-of-sight]] (L-O-S) to the satellite. \nThere are three physical characteristic settings used to ensure that the antenna is configured correctly at the satellite, which are: [[azimuth]], elevation, [[Antenna (radio)|polarization]], and [[Skew (antenna)|skew]]. The combination of these settings gives the outdoor unit a L-O-S to the chosen satellite and makes data transmission possible. These parameters are generally set at the time the equipment is installed, along with a beam assignment (K<sub>a</sub>-band only); these steps must all be taken prior to the actual activation of service.\nTransmit and receive components are typically mounted at the focal point of the antenna which receives/sends data from/to the satellite. The main parts are:\n* Feed \u2013 This assembly is part of the VSAT receive and transmit chain, which consists of several components with different functions, including the feed horn at the front of the unit, which resembles a funnel and has the task of focusing the satellite microwave signals across the surface of the dish reflector. The feed horn both receives signals reflected off the dish's surface and transmits outbound signals back to the satellite.\n* [[Block upconverter]] (BUC) \u2013 This unit sits behind the feed horn and may be part of the same unit, but a larger (higher wattage) BUC could be a separate piece attached to the base of the antenna. Its job is to convert the signal from the modem to a higher frequency and amplify it before it is reflected off the dish and towards the satellite.\n* [[Low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB) \u2013 This is the receiving element of the terminal. The LNB's job is to amplify the received satellite radio signal bouncing off the dish and filter out the noise, which is any signal not carrying valid information. The LNB passes the amplified, filtered signal to the satellite modem at the user's location.\n\n====Indoor unit (IDU)====\nThe satellite [[modem]] serves as an interface between the outdoor unit and customer-provided equipment (i.e. PC, router) and controls satellite transmission and reception. From the sending device (computer, router, etc.) it receives an input [[bitstream]] and converts or modulates it into radio waves, reversing that order for incoming transmissions, which is called [[demodulation]]. It provides two types of connectivity:\n* Coaxial cable (COAX) connectivity to the satellite antenna. The cable carrying electromagnetic satellite signals between the modem and the antenna generally is limited to be no more than 150 feet in length.\n* [[Ethernet]] connectivity to the computer, carrying the customer's data packets to and from the Internet content servers.\nConsumer grade satellite modems typically employ either the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) or WiMAX (World Interoperability for Microwave Access) telecommunication standard to communicate with the assigned gateway.\n\n== Challenges and limitations ==\n===Signal latency===\n[[Latency (engineering)| Latency]] (commonly referred to as \"ping time\") is the delay between requesting data and the receipt of a response, or in the case of one-way communication, between the actual moment of a signal's broadcast and the time it is received at its destination.\n\nA radio signal takes about 120 milliseconds to reach a geostationary satellite and then 120 milliseconds to reach the ground station, so nearly 1/4 of a second overall.  Typically, during perfect conditions, the physics involved in satellite communications account for approximately 550 milliseconds of latency round-trip time.\n\nThe longer latency is the primary difference between a standard terrestrial-based network and a geostationary satellite-based network.  The round-trip latency of a geostationary satellite communications network can be more than 12 times that of a terrestrial based network.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.niasat.com/q-what-is-the-difference-between-terrestrial-land-based-internet-and-satellite-internet-service/|title= Q: What is the difference between terrestrial (land based) Internet and satellite Internet |last= Golding |first= Joshua |publisher= Network Innovation Associates|accessdate= 8 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vsat-systems.com/satellite-internet-explained/latency.html |title= Latency- why is it a big deal for Satellite Internet?|last= |first= |date= |publisher= VSAT Systems|accessdate= 10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Geostationary orbits ====\nA [[geostationary orbit]] (or geostationary Earth orbit/GEO) is a geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator (0\u00b0&nbsp;latitude), with a period equal to the Earth's rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately zero (i.e. a \"circular orbit\"). An object in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Launchers often place communications satellites and weather satellites in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them, but can point permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites stay. Due to the constant 0\u00b0&nbsp;latitude and circularity of geostationary orbits, satellites in GEO differ in location by longitude only.\n\nCompared to ground-based communication, all geostationary satellite communications experience higher latency due to the signal having to travel [[1 E7 m|{{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr= on}}]] to a satellite in geostationary orbit and back to Earth again. Even at the [[speed of light]] (about 300,000&nbsp;km/s or 186,000 miles per second), this delay can appear significant. If all other signaling delays could be eliminated, it still takes a radio signal about 250 milliseconds (ms), or about a quarter of a second, to travel to the satellite and back to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.its.ohiou.edu/kruse/publications/aiaa96.pdf|title= Data Communications Protocol Performance on Geo-stationary Satellite Links (Hans Kruse, Ohio University, 1996)|author= |date= |website= ohiou.edu|accessdate= 28 March 2018}}</ref> The absolute minimum total amount of delay varies, due to the satellite staying in one place in the sky, while ground-based users can be directly below (with a roundtrip latency of 239.6 ms), or far to the side of the planet near the horizon (with a roundtrip latency of 279.0 ms).<ref>Roundtrip latency numbers are from RFC 2488, Section 2: Satellite Characteristics</ref>\n\nFor an Internet packet, that delay is doubled before a reply is received. That is the theoretical minimum. Factoring in other normal delays from network sources gives a typical one-way connection latency of 500\u2013700 ms from the user to the ISP, or about 1,000\u20131,400 ms latency for the total round-trip time (RTT) back to the user. This is more than most dial-up users experience at typically 150\u2013200&nbsp;ms total latency, and much higher than the typical 15\u201340 ms latency experienced by users of other high-speed Internet services, such as [[cable Internet access |cable]] or [[very high bit rate digital subscriber line| VDSL]].<ref>[https://www.thetripleplay.net/att-internet/ See Comparative Latency of Internet Connections in Satellite Internet Connection for Rural Broadband, page 7 (RuMBA White Paper, Stephen Cobb, 2011)]</ref>\n\nFor geostationary satellites, there is no way to eliminate latency, but the problem can be somewhat mitigated in Internet communications with [[TCP acceleration]] features that shorten the apparent round trip time (RTT) per packet by splitting (\"spoofing\") the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver. Certain acceleration features are often present in recent technology developments embedded in satellite Internet equipment.\n\nLatency also impacts the initiation of secure Internet connections such as [[Secure Sockets Layer |SSL]] which require the exchange of numerous pieces of data between web server and web client. Although these pieces of data are small, the multiple round-trips involved in the handshake produce long delays compared to other forms of Internet connectivity, as documented by Stephen T. Cobb in a 2011 report published by the Rural Mobile and Broadband Alliance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rumbausa.net/|title=RuMBA White Paper: Satellite Internet Connection for Rural Broadband |author=Stephen Cobb |website=RuMBA \u2013 Rural Mobile & Broadband Alliance |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729082818/http://www.rumbausa.net/ |archive-date=2012-07-29|url-status=usurped }}</ref> This annoyance extends to entering and editing data using some Software as a Service or [[SaaS]] applications as well as in other forms of online work.\n\nOne should thoroughly test the functionality of live interactive access to a distant computer\u2014such as [[virtual private network]]s. Many TCP protocols were not designed to work in high-latency environments.\n\n==== Medium and Low Earth Orbits ====\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations do not have such great delays, as the satellites are closer to the ground. For example:\n* The current LEO constellations of [[Globalstar]] and [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]] satellites have delays of less than 40 ms round trip, but their throughput is less than broadband at 64 kbit/s per channel.

Consequently, ground-based antennas cannot easily lock into communication with any one specific satellite. As with [[GPS]], for a receiver the satellites are only visible for a part of their orbit, therefore multiple satellites are necessary to establish a permanent internet connection, with low-Earth orbits needing more satellites than medium-Earth orbits. The network has to switch data transfer between satellites to keep a connection to a customer.\n\nOne can communicate with MEO or LEO satellites that move in the sky in three ways, using:\n* more diffuse or completely omnidirectional ground antennas capable of communicating with one or more satellites visible in the sky at the same time, but at significantly higher transmit power than fixed geostationary dish antennas (due to the lower gain), and with much poorer signal-to-noise ratios for receiving the signal \n* motorized antenna mounts with high-gain, narrow beam antennas tracking individual satellites\n* [[phased array]] antennas that can steer the beam electronically, together with software that can predict the path of each satellite in the constellation\n\n==== Ultralight atmospheric aircraft as satellites ====\n\nA proposed alternative to relay satellites is a special-purpose [[solar energy |solar-powered]] [[ultralight]] aircraft, which would fly along a circular path above a fixed ground location, operating under autonomous computer control at a height of approximately 20,000 meters.\n\nFor example, the United States [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] [[DARPA Vulture| Vulture]] project envisaged an ultralight aircraft capable of station-keeping over a fixed area for a period of up to five years, and able to provide both continuous surveillance to ground assets as well as to service extremely low-latency communications networks.<ref>Press release, ''DARPA's Vulture Program Enters Phase II'', September 15, 2010, {{cite web |url= http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1800 |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 2012-11-03 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121017002043/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1800 |archivedate= 2012-10-17 }} retrieved 11/03/2012</ref> This project was cancelled{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} in 2012 before it became operational.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nOnboard batteries would charge during daylight hours through solar panels covering the wings, and would provide power to the plane during night. Ground-based satellite internet dishes would relay signals to and from the aircraft, resulting in a greatly reduced round-trip signal latency of only 0.25 milliseconds.  The planes could potentially run for long periods without refueling. Several such schemes involving various types of aircraft have been proposed in the past.\n\n===Interference===\n\n[[File:Bigpond internet Satellite.jpg|thumbnail|right|A foldable [[Bigpond]] satellite Internet dish]]\n\nSatellite communications are affected by moisture and various forms of precipitation (such as rain or snow) in the signal path between end users or ground stations and the satellite being utilized.  This interference with the signal is known as ''rain fade''. The effects are less pronounced on the lower frequency 'L' and 'C' bands, but can become quite severe on the higher frequency 'Ku' and 'Ka' band.  For satellite Internet services in tropical areas with heavy rain, use of the C band (4/6&nbsp;GHz) with a circular polarisation satellite is popular.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.linksystems-uk.com/c-band-ku-band/|title=C Band Ku Band Comparison|last=|first=|date=2004-07-30|work=Link Communications Systems|access-date=2018-02-10|department=Technical|language=en-GB}}</ref> Satellite communications on the K<sub>a</sub> band (19/29&nbsp;GHz) can use special techniques such as large ''rain margins'', ''adaptive uplink power control'' and ''reduced bit rates'' during precipitation.\n\n''Rain margins'' are the extra communication link requirements needed to account for signal degradations due to moisture and precipitation, and are of acute importance on all systems operating at frequencies over 10&nbsp;GHz.<ref>Takashi Iida [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-OuSc4t7IQC Satellite Communications: System and Its Design Technology], IOS Press, 2000, {{ISBN|4-274-90379-6}}, {{ISBN|978-4-274-90379-3}}</ref>\n\nThe amount of time during which service is lost can be reduced by increasing the size of the [[satellite dish|satellite communication dish]] so as to gather more of the satellite signal on the downlink and also to provide a stronger signal on the uplink.  In other words, increasing antenna gain through the use of a larger parabolic reflector is one way of increasing the overall channel gain and, consequently, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, which allows for greater signal loss due to rain fade without the S/N ratio dropping below its minimum threshold for successful communication.\n\nModern consumer-grade dish antennas tend to be fairly small, which reduces the rain margin or increases the required satellite downlink power and cost.  However, it is often more economical to build a more expensive satellite and smaller, less expensive consumer antennas than to increase the consumer antenna size to reduce the satellite cost.\n\nLarge commercial dishes of 3.7&nbsp;m to 13&nbsp;m diameter can be used to achieve increased rain margins and also to reduce the cost per bit by allowing for more efficient modulation codes. Alternately, larger aperture antennae can require less power from the satellite to achieve acceptable performance.  Satellites typically use [[photovoltaic]] solar power, so there is no expense for the energy itself, but a more powerful satellite will require larger, more powerful solar panels and electronics, often including a larger transmitting antenna.  The larger satellite components not only increase materials costs but also increase the weight of the satellite, and in general, the cost to launch a satellite into an orbit is directly proportional to its weight.  (In addition, since satellite launch vehicles [i.e. rockets] have specific payload size limits, making parts of the satellite larger may require either more complex folding mechanisms for parts of the satellite like solar panels and high-gain antennas, or upgrading to a more expensive launch vehicle that can handle a larger payload.)\n\nModulated carriers can be dynamically altered in response to rain problems or other link impairments using a process called adaptive coding and modulation, or \"ACM\".  ACM allows the bit rates to be increased substantially during normal clear sky conditions, increasing the number of bits per Hz transmitted, and thus reducing overall cost per bit. Adaptive coding requires some sort of a return or feedback channel which can be via any available means, satellite or terrestrial.\n\n===Line of sight===\n\n[[File:FresnelSVG.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Fresnel zone. D is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, r is the radius of the Fresnel zone.]]\nAn object is in your line of sight if you can draw a straight line between yourself and the object without any interference, such as a mountain or a bend in a road. An object beyond the horizon is below the line of sight and, therefore, can be difficult to communicate with.\n\nTypically a completely clear line of sight between the dish and the satellite is required for the system to work optimally. In addition to the signal being susceptible to absorption and scattering by moisture, the signal is similarly impacted by the presence of trees and other vegetation in the path of the signal. As the radio frequency decreases, to below 900&nbsp;MHz, penetration through vegetation increases, but most satellite communications operate above 2&nbsp;GHz making them sensitive to even minor obstructions such as tree foliage. A dish installation in the winter must factor in plant foliage growth that will appear in the spring and summer.\n\n===Fresnel zone===\nEven if there is a direct line of sight between the transmitting and receiving antenna, reflections from objects near the path of the signal can decrease apparent signal power through phase cancellations. Whether and how much signal is lost from a reflection is determined by the location of the object in the [[Fresnel zone]] of the antennas.\n\n== Two-way satellite-only communication ==\n\n[[File:WildBlueSatelliteModemBack.JPG|thumbnail|The back panel of a [[satellite modem]], with coaxial connections for both incoming and outgoing signals, and an [[Ethernet]] port for connection ]]\n\nHome or consumer grade two-way satellite Internet service involves both sending and receiving data from a remote [[very-small-aperture terminal]] (VSAT) via satellite to a hub [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|telecommunications port]] (teleport), which then relays data via the terrestrial Internet. The satellite dish at each location must be precisely pointed to avoid interference with other satellites. At each VSAT site the uplink frequency, bit rate and power must be accurately set, under control of the service provider hub.\n\nThere are several types of two way satellite Internet services, including [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) and [[single channel per carrier]] (SCPC).  Two-way systems can be simple [[VSAT]] terminals with a 60\u2013100&nbsp;cm dish and output power of only a few watts intended for consumers and small business or larger systems which provide more bandwidth. Such systems are frequently marketed as \"satellite broadband\" and can cost two to three times as much per month as land-based systems such as [[ADSL]]. The [[satellite modem|modems]] required for this service are often proprietary, but some are compatible with several different providers. They are also expensive, costing in the range of US$600 to $2000.\n\n[[File:ASTRA2Connect LNB.jpg|thumb|left|The two-way \"iLNB\" used on the [[SES Broadband]].]]\n\nThe two-way \"iLNB\" used on the [[SES Broadband]] terminal dish has a transmitter and single-polarity receive LNB, both operating in the {{Ku band}}. Pricing for SES Broadband modems range from \u20ac299 to \u20ac350. These types of system are generally unsuitable for use on moving vehicles, although some dishes may be fitted to an automatic pan and tilt mechanism to continuously re-align the dish\u2014but these are more expensive. The technology for SES Broadband was delivered by a Belgian company called Newtec.\n\n===Bandwidth===\n\nConsumer satellite Internet customers range from individual home users with one PC to large remote business sites with several hundred PCs.\n\nHome users tend to use shared satellite capacity to reduce the cost, while still allowing high peak bit rates when congestion is absent. There are usually restrictive time-based bandwidth allowances so that each user gets their fair share, according to their payment.  When a user exceeds their allowance, the company may slow down their access, deprioritise their traffic or charge for the excess bandwidth used. For consumer satellite Internet, the allowance can typically range from 200&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] per day to 25&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] per month.<ref name=\"hughesnet-fap-faq\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090728171955/http://consumer.hughesnet.com/faq/fair-access-policy.cfm HughesNet Fair Access Policy FAQ]</ref><ref name=\"wildblue\">{{cite web|title=WildBlue: High Speed Satellite Internet Provider |work=Official web site |url=http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818171337/http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"wildblue_exede\">{{cite web |title= Exede: High Speed Satellite Internet Provider |work= Official web site |url= http://www.exede.com/internet-packages-pricing |accessdate= December 11, 2012 }}</ref> A shared download carrier may have a bit rate of 1 to 40&nbsp;Mbit/s and be shared by up to 100 to 4,000 end users.\n\nThe uplink direction for shared user customers is normally [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA), which involves transmitting occasional short packet bursts in between other users (similar to how a cellular phone shares a cell tower).\n\nEach remote location may also be equipped with a telephone modem; the connections for this are as with a conventional dial-up ISP. Two-way satellite systems may sometimes use the modem channel in both directions for data where latency is more important than bandwidth, reserving the satellite channel for download data where bandwidth is more important than latency, such as for [[file transfer]]s.\n\nIn 2006, the [[European Commission]] sponsored the [[UNIC]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} project which aims at developing an end-to-end scientific test bed for the distribution of new broadband interactive TV-centric services delivered over low-cost two-way satellite to actual end-users in the home. The UNIC architecture employs [[DVB-S2]] standard for downlink and [[DVB-RCS]] standard for uplink.\n\nNormal VSAT dishes (1.2\u20132.4&nbsp;m diameter) are widely used for VoIP phone services. A voice call is sent by means of packets via the satellite and Internet.  Using coding and compression techniques the bit rate needed per call is only 10.8&nbsp;kbit/s each way.\n\n===Portable satellite Internet===\n\n====Portable satellite modem====\n[[File:Portable Satellite Internet Modem and Antenna.jpg|thumb|Portable Satellite Internet Modem and Antenna deployed with the [[Emergency Response Unit (IFRC)|Red Cross]] in [[South Sudan]].]]\nThese usually come in the shape of a self-contained flat rectangular box that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the satellite\u2014unlike VSAT the alignment need not be very precise and the modems have built in signal strength meters to help the user align the device properly. The modems have commonly used connectors such as  [[Ethernet]] or [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB). Some also have an integrated [[Bluetooth]] transceiver and double as a satellite phone. The modems also tend to have their own batteries so they can be connected to a [[laptop]] without draining its battery. The most common such system is [[INMARSAT]]'s [[BGAN]]\u2014these terminals are about the size of a [[briefcase]] and have near-symmetric connection speeds of around 350\u2013500&nbsp;kbit/s. Smaller modems exist like those offered by [[Thuraya]] but only connect at 444&nbsp;kbit/s in a limited coverage area. [[INMARSAT]] now offer the IsatHub, a paperback book sized satellite modem working in conjunction with the users mobile phone and other devices. The cost has been reduced to $3 per MB and the device itself is on sale for about $1300.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdgroup.biz/|title=Security - Communications - Geopolitical - Consultancy|author=|date=|website=Security - Communications - Geopolitical - Consultancy|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUsing such a modem is extremely expensive\u2014data transfer costs between $5 and $7 per [[megabyte]]. The modems themselves are also expensive, usually costing between $1,000 and $5,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmpcs-us.com/inmarsatbgan.htm |title=Inmarsat BGAN |publisher=GMPCS |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\n====Internet via satellite phone====\n\nFor many years{{When|date=July 2011}} [[satellite phone]]s have been able to connect to the Internet. Bandwidth varies from about 2400 [[bit/s]] for [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium network satellites]] and [[ACeS]] based phones to 15&nbsp;kbit/s [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and 60&nbsp;kbit/s [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] for [[Thuraya]] handsets. Globalstar also provides Internet access at 9600 bit/s\u2014like Iridium and ACeS a [[dial-up]] connection is required and is billed per minute, however both [[Globalstar]] and Iridium are planning to launch new satellites offering always-on data services at higher rates. With Thuraya phones the 9,600&nbsp;bit/s dial-up connection is also possible, the 60 kbit/s service is always-on and the user is billed for data transferred (about $5 per [[megabyte]]). The phones can be connected to a laptop or other computer using a USB or [[RS-232]] interface. Due to the low bandwidths involved it is extremely slow to browse the web with such a connection, but useful for sending email, [[Secure Shell]] data and using other low-bandwidth protocols. Since satellite phones tend to have [[omnidirectional antenna]]s no alignment is required as long as there is a line of sight between the phone and the satellite.\n\n== One-way receive, with terrestrial transmit ==\n\nOne-way terrestrial return satellite Internet systems are used with conventional [[dial-up Internet access]], with outbound ([[upstream (networking)|upstream]]) data traveling through a telephone [[modem]], but [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] data sent via satellite at a higher rate. In the U.S., an FCC license is required for the uplink station only; no license is required for the users.\n\nAnother type of 1-way satellite Internet system uses [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS) for the back-channel.<ref>[http://www.gilatnetworks.com/data/uploads/CaseStudies/Case%20Study%20Enitel%202007-04%20(GSM%20SkyAbis).pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409115948/http://www.gilatnetworks.com/data/uploads/CaseStudies/Case%20Study%20Enitel%202007-04%20%28GSM%20SkyAbis%29.pdf |date=April 9, 2008 }}</ref> Using standard GPRS or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), costs are reduced for higher effective rates if the upload volume is very low, and also because this service is not per-time charged, but charged by volume uploaded. GPRS as return improves mobility when the service is provided by a satellite that transmits in the field of 100-200 kW.{{fact|date=June 2019}} Using a 33&nbsp;cm wide satellite dish, a notebook and a normal GPRS equipped [[Mobile phone|GSM phone]], users can get mobile satellite broadband.\n\n===System components===\nThe transmitting station has two components, consisting of a high speed Internet connection to serve many customers at once, and the satellite uplink to broadcast requested data to the customers. The ISP's routers connect to proxy servers which can enforce quality of service (QoS) bandwidth limits and guarantees for each customer's traffic.\n\nOften, nonstandard [[Internet protocol suite|IP stacks]] are used to address the [[#Signal latency|latency]] and asymmetry problems of the satellite connection. As with one-way receive systems, data sent over the satellite link is generally also encrypted, as otherwise it would be accessible to anyone with a satellite receiver.\n\nMany IP-over-satellite implementations use paired proxy servers at both endpoints so that certain communications between clients and servers<ref>ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2488.txt</ref> need not to accept the latency inherent in a satellite connection. For similar reasons, there exist special [[Virtual private network]] (VPN) implementations designed for use over satellite links because standard VPN software cannot handle the long packet travel times.\n\nUpload speeds are limited by the user's dial-up modem, while download speeds can be very fast compared to dial-up, using the modem only as the control channel for packet acknowledgement.\n\nLatency is still high, although lower than full two-way geostationary satellite Internet, since only half of the data path is via satellite, the other half being via the terrestrial channel.\n\n== One-way broadcast, receive only ==\nOne-way broadcast satellite Internet systems are used for [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[broadcast]]-based data, audio and video distribution. In the [[United States|U.S.]], a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license is required only for the uplink station and no license is required for users. Note that most Internet protocols will not work correctly over one-way access, since they require a return channel. However, Internet content such as [[web page]]s can still be distributed over a one-way system by \"pushing\" them out to local storage at end user sites, though full interactivity is not possible. This is much like TV or radio content which offers little user interface.\n\nThe broadcast mechanism may include compression and error correction to help ensure the one-way broadcast is properly received. The data may also be rebroadcast periodically, so that receivers that did not previously succeed will have additional chances to try downloading again.\n\nThe data may also be encrypted, so that while anyone can receive the data, only certain destinations are able to actually decode and use the broadcast data. Authorized users only need to have possession of either a short [[Key (cryptography)|decryption key]] or an automatic [[rolling code]] device that uses its own highly accurate independent timing mechanism to decrypt the data.\n\n===System hardware components===\nSimilar to one-way terrestrial return, satellite Internet access may include interfaces to the [[public switched telephone network]] for squawk box applications. An Internet connection is not required, but many applications include a [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server to queue data for broadcast.\n\n===System software components===\nMost one-way broadcast applications require custom programming at the remote sites. The software at the remote site must filter, store, present a selection interface to and display the data. The software at the transmitting station must provide access control, priority queuing, sending, and encapsulating of the data.\n\n=== Services ===\nEmerging commercial services in this area include:\n* [[Outernet]] \u2013 [[Satellite constellation]] technology\n\n==Efficiency increases==\n\n===2013 FCC report cites big jump in satellite performance===\nIn its report released in February, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission noted significant advances in satellite Internet performance. The FCC's Measuring Broadband America report also ranked the major ISPs by how close they came to delivering on advertised speeds. In this category, satellite Internet topped the list, with 90% of subscribers seeing speeds at 140% or better than what was advertised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america/2013/February |title=Measuring Broadband America \u2013 February 2013 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Reducing satellite latency===\n\nMuch of the slowdown associated with satellite Internet is that for each request, many roundtrips must be completed before any useful data can be received by the requester.<ref>TCP is bound by the low latency of a three-way handshake. See [[TCP handshake|Transmission Control Protocol]].</ref> Special IP stacks and proxies can also reduce [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] through lessening the number of roundtrips, or simplifying and reducing the length of protocol headers. Optimization technologies include [[TCP acceleration]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] pre-fetching and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] caching among many others.

The first commercial communications satellite was [[Telstar|Telstar 1]], built by [[Bell Labs]] and launched in July 1962.\n\nThe idea of a [[geosynchronous satellite]]\u2014one that could orbit the Earth above the equator and remain fixed by following the Earth's rotation\u2014was first proposed by [[Herman Poto\u010dnik]] in 1928 and popularised by the [[science fiction author]] [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in a paper in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Arthur C.

Succeeding generations of communications satellites featuring larger capacities and improved performance characteristics were adopted for use in television delivery, military applications and telecommunications purposes. Following the invention of the [[Internet]] and the World Wide Web, geostationary satellites attracted interest as a potential means of providing Internet access.\n\nA significant enabler of satellite-delivered Internet has been the opening up of the {{Ka band}} for satellites. In December 1993, Hughes Aircraft Co. filed with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for a license to launch the first K<sub>a</sub>-band satellite, [[Spaceway]]. In 1995, the FCC issued a call for more K<sub>a</sub>-band satellite applications, attracting applications from 15 companies. Among those were [[EchoStar]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[SES Americom|GE-Americom]], [[Motorola]] and KaStar Satellite, which later became [[WildBlue]].\n\nAmong prominent aspirants in the early-stage satellite Internet sector was [[Teledesic]], an ambitious and ultimately failed project funded in part by [[Microsoft]] that ended up costing more than $9 billion. Teledesic's idea was to create a [[broadband]] [[satellite constellation]] of hundreds of low-orbiting satellites in the K<sub>a</sub>-band frequency, providing inexpensive Internet access with download speeds of up to 720 Mbit/s. The project was abandoned in 2003. Teledesic's failure, coupled with the bankruptcy filings of the satellite communications providers [[Iridium Communications Inc.]] and [[Globalstar]], dampened marketplace enthusiasm for satellite Internet development. It wasn't until September 2003 when the first Internet-ready satellite for consumers was launched by Eutelsat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/satellite-biz-03zza.html |title=First Internet Ready Satellite Launched |publisher=Space Daily |date=2003-09-29 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, with the launch of [[Anik (satellite)#Anik F2|Anik F2]], the first [[high throughput satellite]], a class of next-generation satellites providing improved capacity and bandwidth became operational.

Other components of a satellite Internet system include a [[modem]] at the user end which links the user's network with the transceiver, and a centralized [[network operations center]] (NOC) for monitoring the entire system.  Working in concert with a broadband gateway, the satellite operates a [[Star network]] topology where all network communication passes through the network's hub processor, which is at the center of the star. With this configuration, the number of remote VSATs that can be connected to the hub is virtually limitless.\n\n===Satellite===\nMarketed as the center of the new broadband satellite networks are a new generation of high-powered GEO satellites positioned {{convert|35786|km|mi}} above the equator, operating in K<sub>a</sub>-band (18.3\u201330&nbsp;GHz) mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/ka-band-permitted-space-station-list |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421053243/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/ka-band-permitted-space-station-list |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-21 |title=Ka-band Permitted Space Station List |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2013-08-29 }}</ref> These new purpose-built satellites are designed and optimized for broadband applications, employing many narrow spot beams,<ref>http://www.dbsinstall.com/PDF/WildBlue/Wildblue_Satellite_Basics.pdf</ref> which target a much smaller area than the broad beams used by earlier communication satellites. This spot beam technology allows satellites to reuse assigned bandwidth multiple times which can enable them to achieve much higher overall capacity than conventional broad beam satellites. The spot beams can also increase performance and consequential capacity by focusing more power and increased receiver sensitivity into defined concentrated areas. Spot beams are designated as one of two types: subscriber spot beams, which transmit to and from the subscriber-side terminal, and gateway spot beams, which transmit to/from a service provider ground station. Note that moving off the tight footprint of a spotbeam can degrade performance significantly. Also, spotbeams can make the use of other significant new technologies impossible, including 'Carrier in [[Carrier wave|Carrier]]' modulation.\n\nIn conjunction with the satellite's spot-beam technology, a [[Transponder (satellite communications)|bent-pipe]] architecture has traditionally been employed in the network in which the satellite functions as a bridge in space, connecting two communication points on the ground. The term \"bent-pipe\" is used to describe the shape of the data path between sending and receiving antennas, with the satellite positioned at the point of the bend.\nSimply put, the satellite's role in this network arrangement is to relay signals from the end user's terminal to the ISP's gateways, and back again without processing the signal at the satellite. The satellite receives, amplifies, and redirects a carrier on a specific radio frequency through a signal path called a transponder.<ref name=\"howsatcomworks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vsat-systems.com/satellite-internet/how-it-works.html |title=How broadband satellite Internet works |publisher=VSAT Systems |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\nSome proposed [[satellite constellation|satellite constellations]] in LEO such as [[Starlink]], [[Telesat]] constellation and [[LeoSat]] will employ [[laser communication in space|laser communication]] equipment for high-throughput optical inter-satellite links. The interconnected satellites allow for direct routing of user data from satellite to satellite and effectively create a space-based [[optical mesh network]] that will enable seamless network management and continuity of service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elon Musk is about to launch the first of 11,925 proposed SpaceX internet satellites \u2014 more than all spacecraft that orbit Earth today|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-microsat-launch-global-internet-2018-2?r=US&IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe satellite has its own set of antennas to receive communication signals from Earth and to transmit signals to their target location. These antennas and transponders are part of the satellite's \"payload\", which is designed to receive and transmit signals to and from various places on Earth. What enables this transmission and reception in the payload transponders is a repeater subsystem (RF (radio frequency) equipment) used to change frequencies, filter, separate, amplify and group signals before routing them to their destination address on Earth. The satellite's high-gain receiving antenna passes the transmitted data to the transponder which filters, translates and amplifies them, then redirects them to the transmitting antenna on board. The signal is then routed to a specific ground location through a channel known as a carrier. Beside the payload, the other main component of a communications satellite is called the bus, which comprises all equipment required to move the satellite into position, supply power, regulate equipment temperatures, provide health and tracking information, and perform numerous other operational tasks.<ref name=\"howsatcomworks\" />\n\n===Gateways===\nAlong with dramatic advances in satellite technology over the past decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.\nThe [[Gateway (telecommunications)|Gateway]]\u2014or Gateway Earth Station (its full name)\u2014is also referred to as a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components.  \nIn short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.\nThe system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for subscriber terminal connections to the Internet.\nIn the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the gateway antenna can stay pointed at a fixed position.\n\n===Antenna dish and modem===\nFor the customer-provided equipment (i.e. PC and router) to access the broadband satellite network, the customer must have additional physical components installed:\n\n====Outdoor unit (ODU)====\nAt the far end of the outdoor unit is typically a small (2\u20133-foot, 60-90cm diameter), reflective dish-type radio antenna. The VSAT antenna must also have an unobstructed view of the sky to allow for proper [[Sightline|line-of-sight]] (L-O-S) to the satellite. \nThere are three physical characteristic settings used to ensure that the antenna is configured correctly at the satellite, which are: [[azimuth]], elevation, [[Antenna (radio)|polarization]], and [[Skew (antenna)|skew]]. The combination of these settings gives the outdoor unit a L-O-S to the chosen satellite and makes data transmission possible. These parameters are generally set at the time the equipment is installed, along with a beam assignment (K<sub>a</sub>-band only); these steps must all be taken prior to the actual activation of service.\nTransmit and receive components are typically mounted at the focal point of the antenna which receives/sends data from/to the satellite. The main parts are:\n* Feed \u2013 This assembly is part of the VSAT receive and transmit chain, which consists of several components with different functions, including the feed horn at the front of the unit, which resembles a funnel and has the task of focusing the satellite microwave signals across the surface of the dish reflector. The feed horn both receives signals reflected off the dish's surface and transmits outbound signals back to the satellite.\n* [[Block upconverter]] (BUC) \u2013 This unit sits behind the feed horn and may be part of the same unit, but a larger (higher wattage) BUC could be a separate piece attached to the base of the antenna. Its job is to convert the signal from the modem to a higher frequency and amplify it before it is reflected off the dish and towards the satellite.\n* [[Low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB) \u2013 This is the receiving element of the terminal. The LNB's job is to amplify the received satellite radio signal bouncing off the dish and filter out the noise, which is any signal not carrying valid information. The LNB passes the amplified, filtered signal to the satellite modem at the user's location.\n\n====Indoor unit (IDU)====\nThe satellite [[modem]] serves as an interface between the outdoor unit and customer-provided equipment (i.e. PC, router) and controls satellite transmission and reception. From the sending device (computer, router, etc.) it receives an input [[bitstream]] and converts or modulates it into radio waves, reversing that order for incoming transmissions, which is called [[demodulation]]. It provides two types of connectivity:\n* Coaxial cable (COAX) connectivity to the satellite antenna. The cable carrying electromagnetic satellite signals between the modem and the antenna generally is limited to be no more than 150 feet in length.\n* [[Ethernet]] connectivity to the computer, carrying the customer's data packets to and from the Internet content servers.\nConsumer grade satellite modems typically employ either the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) or WiMAX (World Interoperability for Microwave Access) telecommunication standard to communicate with the assigned gateway.\n\n== Challenges and limitations ==\n===Signal latency===\n[[Latency (engineering)| Latency]] (commonly referred to as \"ping time\") is the delay between requesting data and the receipt of a response, or in the case of one-way communication, between the actual moment of a signal's broadcast and the time it is received at its destination.\n\nA radio signal takes about 120 milliseconds to reach a geostationary satellite and then 120 milliseconds to reach the ground station, so nearly 1/4 of a second overall.  Typically, during perfect conditions, the physics involved in satellite communications account for approximately 550 milliseconds of latency round-trip time.\n\nThe longer latency is the primary difference between a standard terrestrial-based network and a geostationary satellite-based network.  The round-trip latency of a geostationary satellite communications network can be more than 12 times that of a terrestrial based network.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.niasat.com/q-what-is-the-difference-between-terrestrial-land-based-internet-and-satellite-internet-service/|title= Q: What is the difference between terrestrial (land based) Internet and satellite Internet |last= Golding |first= Joshua |publisher= Network Innovation Associates|accessdate= 8 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vsat-systems.com/satellite-internet-explained/latency.html |title= Latency- why is it a big deal for Satellite Internet?|last= |first= |date= |publisher= VSAT Systems|accessdate= 10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Geostationary orbits ====\nA [[geostationary orbit]] (or geostationary Earth orbit/GEO) is a geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator (0\u00b0&nbsp;latitude), with a period equal to the Earth's rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately zero (i.e. a \"circular orbit\"). An object in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Launchers often place communications satellites and weather satellites in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them, but can point permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites stay. Due to the constant 0\u00b0&nbsp;latitude and circularity of geostationary orbits, satellites in GEO differ in location by longitude only.\n\nCompared to ground-based communication, all geostationary satellite communications experience higher latency due to the signal having to travel [[1 E7 m|{{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr= on}}]] to a satellite in geostationary orbit and back to Earth again. Even at the [[speed of light]] (about 300,000&nbsp;km/s or 186,000 miles per second), this delay can appear significant. If all other signaling delays could be eliminated, it still takes a radio signal about 250 milliseconds (ms), or about a quarter of a second, to travel to the satellite and back to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.its.ohiou.edu/kruse/publications/aiaa96.pdf|title= Data Communications Protocol Performance on Geo-stationary Satellite Links (Hans Kruse, Ohio University, 1996)|author= |date= |website= ohiou.edu|accessdate= 28 March 2018}}</ref> The absolute minimum total amount of delay varies, due to the satellite staying in one place in the sky, while ground-based users can be directly below (with a roundtrip latency of 239.6 ms), or far to the side of the planet near the horizon (with a roundtrip latency of 279.0 ms).<ref>Roundtrip latency numbers are from RFC 2488, Section 2: Satellite Characteristics</ref>\n\nFor an Internet packet, that delay is doubled before a reply is received. That is the theoretical minimum. Factoring in other normal delays from network sources gives a typical one-way connection latency of 500\u2013700 ms from the user to the ISP, or about 1,000\u20131,400 ms latency for the total round-trip time (RTT) back to the user. This is more than most dial-up users experience at typically 150\u2013200&nbsp;ms total latency, and much higher than the typical 15\u201340 ms latency experienced by users of other high-speed Internet services, such as [[cable Internet access |cable]] or [[very high bit rate digital subscriber line| VDSL]].<ref>[https://www.thetripleplay.net/att-internet/ See Comparative Latency of Internet Connections in Satellite Internet Connection for Rural Broadband, page 7 (RuMBA White Paper, Stephen Cobb, 2011)]</ref>\n\nFor geostationary satellites, there is no way to eliminate latency, but the problem can be somewhat mitigated in Internet communications with [[TCP acceleration]] features that shorten the apparent round trip time (RTT) per packet by splitting (\"spoofing\") the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver. Certain acceleration features are often present in recent technology developments embedded in satellite Internet equipment.\n\nLatency also impacts the initiation of secure Internet connections such as [[Secure Sockets Layer |SSL]] which require the exchange of numerous pieces of data between web server and web client. Although these pieces of data are small, the multiple round-trips involved in the handshake produce long delays compared to other forms of Internet connectivity, as documented by Stephen T. Cobb in a 2011 report published by the Rural Mobile and Broadband Alliance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rumbausa.net/|title=RuMBA White Paper: Satellite Internet Connection for Rural Broadband |author=Stephen Cobb |website=RuMBA \u2013 Rural Mobile & Broadband Alliance |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729082818/http://www.rumbausa.net/ |archive-date=2012-07-29|url-status=usurped }}</ref> This annoyance extends to entering and editing data using some Software as a Service or [[SaaS]] applications as well as in other forms of online work.\n\nOne should thoroughly test the functionality of live interactive access to a distant computer\u2014such as [[virtual private network]]s. Many TCP protocols were not designed to work in high-latency environments.\n\n==== Medium and Low Earth Orbits ====\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations do not have such great delays, as the satellites are closer to the ground. For example:\n* The current LEO constellations of [[Globalstar]] and [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]] satellites have delays of less than 40 ms round trip, but their throughput is less than broadband at 64 kbit/s per channel. The Globalstar constellation orbits 1,420&nbsp;km above the Earth and Iridium orbits at 670&nbsp;km altitude.\n* The [[O3b Networks]] MEO constellation orbits at 8,062&nbsp;km, with RTT latency of approximately 125 ms.<ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1407.2521|last1=Wood|first1=Lloyd|title=Revisiting elliptical satellite orbits to enhance the O3b constellation|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=67|pages=110|last2=Lou|first2=Yuxuan|last3=Olusola|first3=Opeoluwa|year=2014|bibcode=2014JBIS...67..110W}}</ref> The proposed new network is also designed for much higher throughput with links well in excess of 1 Gbit/s (Gigabits per second).\n\nUnlike geostationary satellites, low- and medium-Earth orbit satellites do not stay in a fixed position in the sky. Consequently, ground-based antennas cannot easily lock into communication with any one specific satellite. As with [[GPS]], for a receiver the satellites are only visible for a part of their orbit, therefore multiple satellites are necessary to establish a permanent internet connection, with low-Earth orbits needing more satellites than medium-Earth orbits. The network has to switch data transfer between satellites to keep a connection to a customer.\n\nOne can communicate with MEO or LEO satellites that move in the sky in three ways, using:\n* more diffuse or completely omnidirectional ground antennas capable of communicating with one or more satellites visible in the sky at the same time, but at significantly higher transmit power than fixed geostationary dish antennas (due to the lower gain), and with much poorer signal-to-noise ratios for receiving the signal \n* motorized antenna mounts with high-gain, narrow beam antennas tracking individual satellites\n* [[phased array]] antennas that can steer the beam electronically, together with software that can predict the path of each satellite in the constellation\n\n==== Ultralight atmospheric aircraft as satellites ====\n\nA proposed alternative to relay satellites is a special-purpose [[solar energy |solar-powered]] [[ultralight]] aircraft, which would fly along a circular path above a fixed ground location, operating under autonomous computer control at a height of approximately 20,000 meters.\n\nFor example, the United States [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] [[DARPA Vulture| Vulture]] project envisaged an ultralight aircraft capable of station-keeping over a fixed area for a period of up to five years, and able to provide both continuous surveillance to ground assets as well as to service extremely low-latency communications networks.<ref>Press release, ''DARPA's Vulture Program Enters Phase II'', September 15, 2010, {{cite web |url= http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1800 |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 2012-11-03 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121017002043/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1800 |archivedate= 2012-10-17 }} retrieved 11/03/2012</ref> This project was cancelled{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} in 2012 before it became operational.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nOnboard batteries would charge during daylight hours through solar panels covering the wings, and would provide power to the plane during night. Ground-based satellite internet dishes would relay signals to and from the aircraft, resulting in a greatly reduced round-trip signal latency of only 0.25 milliseconds.  The planes could potentially run for long periods without refueling. Several such schemes involving various types of aircraft have been proposed in the past.\n\n===Interference===\n\n[[File:Bigpond internet Satellite.jpg|thumbnail|right|A foldable [[Bigpond]] satellite Internet dish]]\n\nSatellite communications are affected by moisture and various forms of precipitation (such as rain or snow) in the signal path between end users or ground stations and the satellite being utilized.  This interference with the signal is known as ''rain fade''. The effects are less pronounced on the lower frequency 'L' and 'C' bands, but can become quite severe on the higher frequency 'Ku' and 'Ka' band.  For satellite Internet services in tropical areas with heavy rain, use of the C band (4/6&nbsp;GHz) with a circular polarisation satellite is popular.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.linksystems-uk.com/c-band-ku-band/|title=C Band Ku Band Comparison|last=|first=|date=2004-07-30|work=Link Communications Systems|access-date=2018-02-10|department=Technical|language=en-GB}}</ref> Satellite communications on the K<sub>a</sub> band (19/29&nbsp;GHz) can use special techniques such as large ''rain margins'', ''adaptive uplink power control'' and ''reduced bit rates'' during precipitation.\n\n''Rain margins'' are the extra communication link requirements needed to account for signal degradations due to moisture and precipitation, and are of acute importance on all systems operating at frequencies over 10&nbsp;GHz.<ref>Takashi Iida [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-OuSc4t7IQC Satellite Communications: System and Its Design Technology], IOS Press, 2000, {{ISBN|4-274-90379-6}}, {{ISBN|978-4-274-90379-3}}</ref>\n\nThe amount of time during which service is lost can be reduced by increasing the size of the [[satellite dish|satellite communication dish]] so as to gather more of the satellite signal on the downlink and also to provide a stronger signal on the uplink.  In other words, increasing antenna gain through the use of a larger parabolic reflector is one way of increasing the overall channel gain and, consequently, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, which allows for greater signal loss due to rain fade without the S/N ratio dropping below its minimum threshold for successful communication.\n\nModern consumer-grade dish antennas tend to be fairly small, which reduces the rain margin or increases the required satellite downlink power and cost.  However, it is often more economical to build a more expensive satellite and smaller, less expensive consumer antennas than to increase the consumer antenna size to reduce the satellite cost.\n\nLarge commercial dishes of 3.7&nbsp;m to 13&nbsp;m diameter can be used to achieve increased rain margins and also to reduce the cost per bit by allowing for more efficient modulation codes. Alternately, larger aperture antennae can require less power from the satellite to achieve acceptable performance.  Satellites typically use [[photovoltaic]] solar power, so there is no expense for the energy itself, but a more powerful satellite will require larger, more powerful solar panels and electronics, often including a larger transmitting antenna.  The larger satellite components not only increase materials costs but also increase the weight of the satellite, and in general, the cost to launch a satellite into an orbit is directly proportional to its weight.  (In addition, since satellite launch vehicles [i.e. rockets] have specific payload size limits, making parts of the satellite larger may require either more complex folding mechanisms for parts of the satellite like solar panels and high-gain antennas, or upgrading to a more expensive launch vehicle that can handle a larger payload.)\n\nModulated carriers can be dynamically altered in response to rain problems or other link impairments using a process called adaptive coding and modulation, or \"ACM\".  ACM allows the bit rates to be increased substantially during normal clear sky conditions, increasing the number of bits per Hz transmitted, and thus reducing overall cost per bit. Adaptive coding requires some sort of a return or feedback channel which can be via any available means, satellite or terrestrial.\n\n===Line of sight===\n\n[[File:FresnelSVG.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Fresnel zone. D is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, r is the radius of the Fresnel zone.]]\nAn object is in your line of sight if you can draw a straight line between yourself and the object without any interference, such as a mountain or a bend in a road. An object beyond the horizon is below the line of sight and, therefore, can be difficult to communicate with.\n\nTypically a completely clear line of sight between the dish and the satellite is required for the system to work optimally. In addition to the signal being susceptible to absorption and scattering by moisture, the signal is similarly impacted by the presence of trees and other vegetation in the path of the signal. As the radio frequency decreases, to below 900&nbsp;MHz, penetration through vegetation increases, but most satellite communications operate above 2&nbsp;GHz making them sensitive to even minor obstructions such as tree foliage. A dish installation in the winter must factor in plant foliage growth that will appear in the spring and summer.\n\n===Fresnel zone===\nEven if there is a direct line of sight between the transmitting and receiving antenna, reflections from objects near the path of the signal can decrease apparent signal power through phase cancellations. Whether and how much signal is lost from a reflection is determined by the location of the object in the [[Fresnel zone]] of the antennas.\n\n== Two-way satellite-only communication ==\n\n[[File:WildBlueSatelliteModemBack.JPG|thumbnail|The back panel of a [[satellite modem]], with coaxial connections for both incoming and outgoing signals, and an [[Ethernet]] port for connection ]]\n\nHome or consumer grade two-way satellite Internet service involves both sending and receiving data from a remote [[very-small-aperture terminal]] (VSAT) via satellite to a hub [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|telecommunications port]] (teleport), which then relays data via the terrestrial Internet. The satellite dish at each location must be precisely pointed to avoid interference with other satellites. At each VSAT site the uplink frequency, bit rate and power must be accurately set, under control of the service provider hub.\n\nThere are several types of two way satellite Internet services, including [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) and [[single channel per carrier]] (SCPC).  Two-way systems can be simple [[VSAT]] terminals with a 60\u2013100&nbsp;cm dish and output power of only a few watts intended for consumers and small business or larger systems which provide more bandwidth. Such systems are frequently marketed as \"satellite broadband\" and can cost two to three times as much per month as land-based systems such as [[ADSL]]. The [[satellite modem|modems]] required for this service are often proprietary, but some are compatible with several different providers. They are also expensive, costing in the range of US$600 to $2000.\n\n[[File:ASTRA2Connect LNB.jpg|thumb|left|The two-way \"iLNB\" used on the [[SES Broadband]].]]\n\nThe two-way \"iLNB\" used on the [[SES Broadband]] terminal dish has a transmitter and single-polarity receive LNB, both operating in the {{Ku band}}. Pricing for SES Broadband modems range from \u20ac299 to \u20ac350. These types of system are generally unsuitable for use on moving vehicles, although some dishes may be fitted to an automatic pan and tilt mechanism to continuously re-align the dish\u2014but these are more expensive. The technology for SES Broadband was delivered by a Belgian company called Newtec.\n\n===Bandwidth===\n\nConsumer satellite Internet customers range from individual home users with one PC to large remote business sites with several hundred PCs.\n\nHome users tend to use shared satellite capacity to reduce the cost, while still allowing high peak bit rates when congestion is absent. There are usually restrictive time-based bandwidth allowances so that each user gets their fair share, according to their payment.  When a user exceeds their allowance, the company may slow down their access, deprioritise their traffic or charge for the excess bandwidth used. For consumer satellite Internet, the allowance can typically range from 200&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] per day to 25&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] per month.<ref name=\"hughesnet-fap-faq\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090728171955/http://consumer.hughesnet.com/faq/fair-access-policy.cfm HughesNet Fair Access Policy FAQ]</ref><ref name=\"wildblue\">{{cite web|title=WildBlue: High Speed Satellite Internet Provider |work=Official web site |url=http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818171337/http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"wildblue_exede\">{{cite web |title= Exede: High Speed Satellite Internet Provider |work= Official web site |url= http://www.exede.com/internet-packages-pricing |accessdate= December 11, 2012 }}</ref> A shared download carrier may have a bit rate of 1 to 40&nbsp;Mbit/s and be shared by up to 100 to 4,000 end users.\n\nThe uplink direction for shared user customers is normally [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA), which involves transmitting occasional short packet bursts in between other users (similar to how a cellular phone shares a cell tower).\n\nEach remote location may also be equipped with a telephone modem; the connections for this are as with a conventional dial-up ISP. Two-way satellite systems may sometimes use the modem channel in both directions for data where latency is more important than bandwidth, reserving the satellite channel for download data where bandwidth is more important than latency, such as for [[file transfer]]s.\n\nIn 2006, the [[European Commission]] sponsored the [[UNIC]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} project which aims at developing an end-to-end scientific test bed for the distribution of new broadband interactive TV-centric services delivered over low-cost two-way satellite to actual end-users in the home. The UNIC architecture employs [[DVB-S2]] standard for downlink and [[DVB-RCS]] standard for uplink.\n\nNormal VSAT dishes (1.2\u20132.4&nbsp;m diameter) are widely used for VoIP phone services. A voice call is sent by means of packets via the satellite and Internet.  Using coding and compression techniques the bit rate needed per call is only 10.8&nbsp;kbit/s each way.\n\n===Portable satellite Internet===\n\n====Portable satellite modem====\n[[File:Portable Satellite Internet Modem and Antenna.jpg|thumb|Portable Satellite Internet Modem and Antenna deployed with the [[Emergency Response Unit (IFRC)|Red Cross]] in [[South Sudan]].]]\nThese usually come in the shape of a self-contained flat rectangular box that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the satellite\u2014unlike VSAT the alignment need not be very precise and the modems have built in signal strength meters to help the user align the device properly. The modems have commonly used connectors such as  [[Ethernet]] or [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB). Some also have an integrated [[Bluetooth]] transceiver and double as a satellite phone. The modems also tend to have their own batteries so they can be connected to a [[laptop]] without draining its battery. The most common such system is [[INMARSAT]]'s [[BGAN]]\u2014these terminals are about the size of a [[briefcase]] and have near-symmetric connection speeds of around 350\u2013500&nbsp;kbit/s. Smaller modems exist like those offered by [[Thuraya]] but only connect at 444&nbsp;kbit/s in a limited coverage area. [[INMARSAT]] now offer the IsatHub, a paperback book sized satellite modem working in conjunction with the users mobile phone and other devices. The cost has been reduced to $3 per MB and the device itself is on sale for about $1300.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdgroup.biz/|title=Security - Communications - Geopolitical - Consultancy|author=|date=|website=Security - Communications - Geopolitical - Consultancy|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUsing such a modem is extremely expensive\u2014data transfer costs between $5 and $7 per [[megabyte]]. The modems themselves are also expensive, usually costing between $1,000 and $5,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmpcs-us.com/inmarsatbgan.htm |title=Inmarsat BGAN |publisher=GMPCS |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\n====Internet via satellite phone====\n\nFor many years{{When|date=July 2011}} [[satellite phone]]s have been able to connect to the Internet. Bandwidth varies from about 2400 [[bit/s]] for [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium network satellites]] and [[ACeS]] based phones to 15&nbsp;kbit/s [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and 60&nbsp;kbit/s [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] for [[Thuraya]] handsets. Globalstar also provides Internet access at 9600 bit/s\u2014like Iridium and ACeS a [[dial-up]] connection is required and is billed per minute, however both [[Globalstar]] and Iridium are planning to launch new satellites offering always-on data services at higher rates. With Thuraya phones the 9,600&nbsp;bit/s dial-up connection is also possible, the 60 kbit/s service is always-on and the user is billed for data transferred (about $5 per [[megabyte]]). The phones can be connected to a laptop or other computer using a USB or [[RS-232]] interface. Due to the low bandwidths involved it is extremely slow to browse the web with such a connection, but useful for sending email, [[Secure Shell]] data and using other low-bandwidth protocols. Since satellite phones tend to have [[omnidirectional antenna]]s no alignment is required as long as there is a line of sight between the phone and the satellite.\n\n== One-way receive, with terrestrial transmit ==\n\nOne-way terrestrial return satellite Internet systems are used with conventional [[dial-up Internet access]], with outbound ([[upstream (networking)|upstream]]) data traveling through a telephone [[modem]], but [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] data sent via satellite at a higher rate. In the U.S., an FCC license is required for the uplink station only; no license is required for the users.\n\nAnother type of 1-way satellite Internet system uses [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS) for the back-channel.<ref>[http://www.gilatnetworks.com/data/uploads/CaseStudies/Case%20Study%20Enitel%202007-04%20(GSM%20SkyAbis).pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409115948/http://www.gilatnetworks.com/data/uploads/CaseStudies/Case%20Study%20Enitel%202007-04%20%28GSM%20SkyAbis%29.pdf |date=April 9, 2008 }}</ref> Using standard GPRS or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), costs are reduced for higher effective rates if the upload volume is very low, and also because this service is not per-time charged, but charged by volume uploaded. GPRS as return improves mobility when the service is provided by a satellite that transmits in the field of 100-200 kW.{{fact|date=June 2019}} Using a 33&nbsp;cm wide satellite dish, a notebook and a normal GPRS equipped [[Mobile phone|GSM phone]], users can get mobile satellite broadband.\n\n===System components===\nThe transmitting station has two components, consisting of a high speed Internet connection to serve many customers at once, and the satellite uplink to broadcast requested data to the customers. The ISP's routers connect to proxy servers which can enforce quality of service (QoS) bandwidth limits and guarantees for each customer's traffic.\n\nOften, nonstandard [[Internet protocol suite|IP stacks]] are used to address the [[#Signal latency|latency]] and asymmetry problems of the satellite connection. As with one-way receive systems, data sent over the satellite link is generally also encrypted, as otherwise it would be accessible to anyone with a satellite receiver.\n\nMany IP-over-satellite implementations use paired proxy servers at both endpoints so that certain communications between clients and servers<ref>ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2488.txt</ref> need not to accept the latency inherent in a satellite connection. For similar reasons, there exist special [[Virtual private network]] (VPN) implementations designed for use over satellite links because standard VPN software cannot handle the long packet travel times.\n\nUpload speeds are limited by the user's dial-up modem, while download speeds can be very fast compared to dial-up, using the modem only as the control channel for packet acknowledgement.\n\nLatency is still high, although lower than full two-way geostationary satellite Internet, since only half of the data path is via satellite, the other half being via the terrestrial channel.\n\n== One-way broadcast, receive only ==\nOne-way broadcast satellite Internet systems are used for [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[broadcast]]-based data, audio and video distribution. In the [[United States|U.S.]], a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license is required only for the uplink station and no license is required for users. Note that most Internet protocols will not work correctly over one-way access, since they require a return channel. However, Internet content such as [[web page]]s can still be distributed over a one-way system by \"pushing\" them out to local storage at end user sites, though full interactivity is not possible. This is much like TV or radio content which offers little user interface.\n\nThe broadcast mechanism may include compression and error correction to help ensure the one-way broadcast is properly received. The data may also be rebroadcast periodically, so that receivers that did not previously succeed will have additional chances to try downloading again.\n\nThe data may also be encrypted, so that while anyone can receive the data, only certain destinations are able to actually decode and use the broadcast data. Authorized users only need to have possession of either a short [[Key (cryptography)|decryption key]] or an automatic [[rolling code]] device that uses its own highly accurate independent timing mechanism to decrypt the data.\n\n===System hardware components===\nSimilar to one-way terrestrial return, satellite Internet access may include interfaces to the [[public switched telephone network]] for squawk box applications. An Internet connection is not required, but many applications include a [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server to queue data for broadcast.\n\n===System software components===\nMost one-way broadcast applications require custom programming at the remote sites. The software at the remote site must filter, store, present a selection interface to and display the data. The software at the transmitting station must provide access control, priority queuing, sending, and encapsulating of the data.\n\n=== Services ===\nEmerging commercial services in this area include:\n* [[Outernet]] \u2013 [[Satellite constellation]] technology\n\n==Efficiency increases==\n\n===2013 FCC report cites big jump in satellite performance===\nIn its report released in February, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission noted significant advances in satellite Internet performance. The FCC's Measuring Broadband America report also ranked the major ISPs by how close they came to delivering on advertised speeds. In this category, satellite Internet topped the list, with 90% of subscribers seeing speeds at 140% or better than what was advertised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america/2013/February |title=Measuring Broadband America \u2013 February 2013 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Reducing satellite latency===\n\nMuch of the slowdown associated with satellite Internet is that for each request, many roundtrips must be completed before any useful data can be received by the requester.<ref>TCP is bound by the low latency of a three-way handshake. See [[TCP handshake|Transmission Control Protocol]].</ref> Special IP stacks and proxies can also reduce [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] through lessening the number of roundtrips, or simplifying and reducing the length of protocol headers. Optimization technologies include [[TCP acceleration]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] pre-fetching and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] caching among many others.

Retrieved January 17, 2011 {{in lang|id}}</ref> and at nearly 4 million at the 2015 Census;<ref name=\"Badan Pusat Statistik 2018\">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018.</ref> the latest official estimate (for 2017) is 4,119,794. One of five Indonesian provinces in Kalimantan, it is bordered by the [[Makassar Strait]] in the east, [[Central Kalimantan]] in the west and north, the [[Java Sea]] in the south, and [[East Kalimantan]] in the north. The province also includes the island of [[Laut Island|Laut]], located off the eastern coast of Kalimantan. The province is divided into 11 regencies and 2 cities. South Kalimantan is the traditional homeland of the [[Banjar people]], although there are some part of [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]] that is also included in this criteria. Nevertheless, South Kalimantan, especially the capital city [[Banjarmasin]] has always\u00a0 be the cultural capital of Banjarese culture. Many Banjarese has migrated to other parts of Indonesia, as well as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and [[Malaysia]]. In addition, other ethnic groups also inhabit the province, such as several group of the [[Dayaks]], who mostly live in the interior part of the province, as well as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], who mostly migrated from [[Java]] due to the [[Transmigration program]] which dated from the Dutch colonial era.\n\nThe history of South Kalimantan was synonymous with the establishment of the Kingdom of Tanjung Puri around the 5th to 6th century AD. This kingdom is strategically located at the foot of the [[Meratus Mountains]] and on the banks of a large river so that later it becomes a fairly well-developed city. Soon after, the Kingdom of Negara Dipa was established by immigrants from Java. In the 15th century, an attack from Java nearly destroyed this Kingdom of Dipa. To save the kingdom, the new dynasty led by Maharaja Sari Kaburangi immediately ascended the throne and moved the center of government towards the downstream, namely towards the sea at Muhara Rampiau. The Kingdom of Dipa avoided total destruction, it renamed itself as the Kingdom of [[Negara Daha]]. The [[Negara Daha]] eventually suffered a setback with the emergence of a power struggle that took place since Raden Samudra took up arms from the direction of the estuary, in addition to also establishing settlement for the [[Vicegerent|''patih'']] who were in the estuary. This settlement would form the predecessor of the modern-city of [[Banjarmasin]]. With help from Mangkubumi Aria Taranggana, Raden Samudra converted to [[Islam]] on September 24, 1526, changing his name to Sultan Suriansyah, and changed the name of Negara Daha to the [[Sultanate of Banjar]]. Banjar at first paid tribute to the [[Sultanate of Demak]]. That state met its demise in the mid-16th century, however, and Banjar was not required to send tribute to new power in [[Java]], the [[Kingdom of Pajang|Sultanate of Pajang]]. Banjar rose in the first decades of the 17th century as a producer and trader of [[Cubeb|pepper]]. Soon, virtually all of the southwest, southeast, and eastern areas of Kalimantan island were paying tribute to the sultanate. [[Sultan Agung]] of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] (1613\u20131646), who ruled north Java coastal ports such as [[Jepara]], [[Gresik]], [[Tuban]], [[Madura]] and [[Surabaya]], planned to colonise the Banjar-dominated areas of Kalimantan in 1622, but the plan was cancelled due to inadequate resources. Europeans began arriving in the region in the 16th century. The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] initially built a trade post in the region, but was expelled by the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. After the war ended, the British returned the region to the Dutch. A new round of history in South Kalimantan began with the rise of the people against the Dutch. [[Prince Antasari]] led the resistance against the Dutch, whom eventually abolished the sultanate, while Sultan Muhammad Seman who became its leader died in battle. Since then South Kalimantan has been fully controlled by the Dutch. Japanese forces took control of the region in 1942, resulting in the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|three years of brutal occupation]] before [[Surrender of Japan|surrendering]] in 1945. The Dutch briefly return to assume control, but this resulted in a [[Indonesian National Revolution|nationwide resistance]]. In 1949, the Dutch left and control of the region was handed to the new [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]].\n\n==History==\n=== Etymology ===\nSouth Kalimantan is known as the Land of Lambung Mangkurat ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Bumi Lambung Mangkurat'').<ref name=\"De kroniek van Bandjarmasin\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ctwBAAAAMAAJ&q=Lamboeng+Mangkoerat&dq=De+kroniek+van+Bandjarmasin|title=De kroniek van Bandjarmasin|last=Cense|first=Anton Abraham|publisher=C.A.

The existence of the Maanyan mythology tells the golden age of the Nan Sarunai Kingdom, an ancient kingdom that used to unite the Maanyan people in this area and has made connections with the island of [[Madagascar]] off the coast of Africa. One of the archaeological remains from this era is the Great Temple located in the town of Amuntai. In 1996, C-14 testing of charcoal samples from the Agung Temple produced a number of years ranging from 242 to 226 BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kusmartono and Widianto|last=|first=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=19\u201320}}</ref>\u00a0 Judging from the number of years referred to, the Kingdom of Nan Saruna is 600 years older than the Kutai Martapura Kingdom in East Kalimantan.

Francois-Xavier Ricaut has shown that the [[Malagasy people]] in Madagascar genetic diversity is 68 percent of Africans and 32 percent of Asians. Based on their evidence, Banjar is the Asian population that is most likely to travel to Madagascar. Genetic dating supports the hypothesis that Austronesian migration occurred about 1,000 years ago, while the last significant [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migration to Madagascar began 300 years later, perhaps after climate change in Africa. Language shifts are thought to have occurred in Southeast Kalimantan after Banjar migration to Madagascar. It is estimated that the [[Banjar people]], who currently speak Malay, may speak a language closer to the language reconstructed for Proto-Malagasy. This linguistic change will follow the main cultural and genetic mix with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], driven by the trade post of the Malay Empire in Southeast Kalimantan. The collapse of the Malay Empire during the 15th and 16th centuries could coincide with the end of the mixture of Malay genes into the Banjar population.<ref name=\"No one is an island\">{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-island-history-human-genetic-ancestry.html|title=No one is an island: The history of human genetic ancestry in Madagascar|author=Oxford University Press|date=July 5, 2016|publisher=phys.org|language=id}}</ref> Genetically, ancient Banjar tribes have been formed thousands of years ago, which is a mixture of ancient Malays as the dominant element and Dayak Maanyan people.

The father of Raden Samudera was Raden Manteri Jaya, son of Raden Begawan, brother of Maharaja Sukarama. The will caused Raden Samudera to be threatened with safety because the sons of Maharaja Sukarama were ambitious as kings, namely Prince Bagalung, Prince Mangkubumi and Prince Tumenggung. Assisted by Arya Taranggana, Raden Samudra fled by boat to the lower [[Barito River|Barito]] river. After Sukarama's death, Prince Mangkubumi became the King of the [[Negara Daha]], then replaced by Prince Tumenggung who was also the son of Sukarama. RadenSamudra, disguised as a fisherman in the Balandean and Kuin areas, was accommodated by Patih Masih at his home.

After 1637 there was a massive migration from Java as a result of the victims of Sultan Agung's political aggression. The arrival of immigrants from Java had a huge influence so that the ports on the island of Borneo became the center of diffusion of [[Javanese culture]].\n\nBesides facing an invasion plan from Mataram, the Sultanate of Banjarmasin also had to face the increasing [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] presence in the region.

In the fractional areas, the king has the title Prince, only in the Sultanate of Banjar has the right to use the title Sultan. Other sultanates sent tribute to the Sultanate of Banjar, including the Paser Sultanate which was conquered in 1636 with the help of the Dutch.\n\nInitially, the capital of the Banjar Sultanate was in Banjarmasin, but then was moved to [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/londongeneralga00broogoog|quote=bendermassing.|title=The London general gazetteer; or, compendious geographical dictionary...|last=Brookes|first=Richard|publisher=T.

Prince Nata Dilaga who became the first king of the dynasty Tamjidullah I in his heyday of power, declared himself as ''Susuhunan Nata Alam'' in 1772. The son of Sultan Muhammad Aliuddin Aminullah named Prince Amir, or grandson of Sultan Hamidullah fled to the Paser Kingdom, and asked his uncle for help named Arung Tarawe (and Queen Goddess). Prince Amir then returned and invaded the Banjar Sultanate with a large [[Buginese people|Buginese]] army in 1757, and tried to reclaim his throne from Susuhunan Nata Alam. Fearing the loss of the throne and worries about the fall of the kingdom under the rule of the Bugis, Susuhunan Nata Alam requested assistance from the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).\n\nThe VOC accepted the request and sent Captain Hoffman with his forces and succeeded in defeating the Buginese forces. Prince Amir was forced to flee back to the Paser Kingdom. Some time later Prince Amir also tried to ask for help from the Banjar nobles in the [[Barito River|Barito]] area who were not happy with the Dutch presence. In this second battle, Prince Amir was captured and was exiled to [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]] in 1787. After that an agreement was made between the Sultanate of Banjar and the VOC, where the kings of the Banjar ruled the kingdom as borrowers of VOC land. In 1826 a re-agreement was held between the [[Dutch East Indies]] Government and Sultan Adam, based on the previous agreement VOC. According to this agreement, the Dutch are allowed to interfere with the regulation of issues regarding the appointment of the Crown Prince and the ''Mangkubumi'', which resulted in the destruction of royal customs in this field, which then made one of the causes of the outbreak of the [[Banjarmasin War]].\n[[File:1._ZM_Stoomschip_Celebes_in_gevecht_met_een_Kota_Mara_6_aug_1859_Poeloe_Kananat_opgenomen.jpg|thumb|The steamship ''Celebes'' fighting with armed Dayak vessels]]\nThe Banjarmasin War took place between 1859 and 1905 (1859\u20131863 according to Dutch sources).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aw44lFhJq6QC&lpg=PT48&dq=pangeran%20antasari&pg=PT48#v=onepage&q=pangeran%20antasari&f=false|title=Pengetahuan Sosial Sejarah 2|author=Drs.

The Dutch launched the \"Expedition to the Southern and Eastern region of Borneo\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Expeditie naar de Zuider- en Oosterafdeling van Borneo''), resulting in the destruction of the Banjar Sultanate. Resistance towards the Dutch continued until 1905, when Dutch forces under the leadership of Lieutenant Christofel who were experienced in the [[Aceh War]], with a large number of [[Korps Marechaussee te voet]] troops, attacked Manawing fortress in January 1905. The [[Korps Marechaussee te voet]] was a non-military corps established by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1890 to handle police duties help in military duties.

In 1938, the Residency of Western Borneo ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo'') and the Residency of South and Eastern Borneo were merged into the Government of Borneo ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Gouvernement of Borneo'') with [[Banjarmasin|Bandjermasin]] as its capital ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''stadsgemeente'').\n\n=== Japanese invasion and occupation ===\nDuring the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]] of [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded Borneo. Immediately after the capture of [[Balikpapan]] on January 26, 1942, the 56th Mixed Infantry Group was ordered to complete the occupation of Dutch Borneo by invading Bandjermasin, its capital. During the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1942)|Battle of Balikpapan]] and also after the occupation of the city, all efforts were made to gather information from Japanese residents, natives and prisoners of war. Reconnaissance flights in the area were carried out by naval air units. It was necessary to capture Bandjermasin, as soon as possible, to secure its airfield for combat aircraft scheduled to participate in the [[Battle of Java (1942)|Java Operation]].\n\nA Sea Drive Unit under command of Captain Yoshibumi Okamoto left Balikpapan on the evening of January 27, 1942, three days ahead of the main Land Drive Unit. The craft moved only at night and were carefully concealed in the river banks during the daylight hours and camouflaged with mangrove branches, while the troops were resting in the forest, so that they were completely hidden from aerial reconnaissance planes. Radio silence was maintained all the time. One naval officer was attached to the unit as a pilot. The surprise night attack was successfully carried out on the town of [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaroe]] on [[Laut Island|Laoet Island]], as planned. Very little resistance was encountered and a large quantity of military supplies and provisions was captured.\n\nApparently the local administrative governor wasn't very pleased with his territorial commander and he asked the main [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) HQ on [[Java]] for a replacement. The replacement commander was on his way by airplane, but returned as they saw Bandjarmasin was on fire and they thought, although wrongly, that it was already occupied by Japanese troops and perhaps it would be unwise to attempt a landing. The Okamoto's unit landed at a point approximately 80&nbsp;km southeast of Bandjarmasin on February 8, 1942 and advanced overland without opposition, to the airfield. As the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed the enemy, there was no fighting after the Sea Drive Unit reached the Martapoera airfield on February 10, 1942.\n\nAt 0900 on February 10, the [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapoera]] airfield was captured by the Advance Force together with the Engineer Company. By the evening of February 10, with the arrival of the main force and the Sea Land Unit, Bandjermasin was finally occupied. There was no fighting.\n\nLieutenant Colonel H. T. Halkema came by sea to the [[Barito River]], with his staff, accompanied by elements of units under his command. By now many KNIL native soldiers had already deserted with defeat of the colonial Dutch lingering in the air. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema received orders to proceed to Kotawarangin airfield. When he arrived there, with only 75 men left under his depleted command, he received an order to have part of his shrunken force, soldiers that were physically capable, to staunchly defend the airfield, while those remnants that are too weak and exhausted should to be sent to Java . Lieutenant Colonel Halkema was later even court-marshalled by the military court (''Hoog Militair Gerechtshof''). In the meantime a brave group of civilians, and military escapees, 180 persons, managed to evade the Japanese aboard a small coaster to [[Madura Island|Madoera Island]], among which also included 20 women.\n\nThe official Japanese casualties during the Bandjermasin operation numbered only 9 soldiers who were killed or died from various diseases, while at least 80% of the men were infected with malaria. The casualties and the number of POWs on the Dutch side are unknown. The distance travelled by land routes was approximately 400&nbsp;km and the distance through jungle approximately 100&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bandjermasin.html|title=The capture of Bandjermasin|last=L|first=Klemen|date=1999\u20132000|work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], Borneo and eastern Indonesia were controlled by the 2nd South Fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].

The Dutch then withdraw from the region, ending the three-century long Dutch presence in the region. The region was initially incorporated into the Indonesian province of Kalimantan, but in 1956 the province was dissolved and separated into two province, [[West Kalimantan]] and South Kalimantan. In 1957 South Kalimantan was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the [[Muslim]] population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on May 23, 1957 under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared [[Central Kalimantan]] the seventeenth province of Indonesia.\n\n==Geography==\nSouth Kalimantan is a province located on the island of Borneo, located between longitude 21 21 49 \"LS, 114 19\" 33 \"BT \u2013 116 33 '28 BT, and 21' 49\" LS 110 \"14\" LS on the map. South Kalimantan has a total area of 37,377.53 km2 and is divided into four regions. These reion are [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaru]] Region which is largest area in South Kalimantan with an area of 13,044.50 km2, Banjar Regionwith an area of 5,039.90 km2, Tabalong Region with an area of 3,039.90 km2, and the city of [[Banjarmasin]] as the narrowest area with an area of 72.00 km2.\n\nGeographically, South Kalimantan is in the southeastern part of the island of [[Borneo]], has a low-lying area in the west and east coast, and a plateau formed by the [[Meratus Mountains]] in the middle. South Kalimantan consists of two main geographic features, namely the lowlands and the highlands. Lowland areas are mostly in the form of peatlands to swamps, which are rich in biodiversity sources of freshwater animals. Some highland areas are still natural tropical forests and protected by the government.\n\nSouth Kalimantan has extensive forests namely Permanent Forests (139,315 ha), Production Forests (1,325,024 ha), Protected Forests (139,315 ha), Convention Forests (348,919 ha). Forestry consists of two types, namely wood and non-wood. The area of forest in South Kalimantan is 1,659,003 ha including; protected forests, natural forests, permanent production forests, limited production forests, conversion forests and mangrove forests. Some are tropical forests and protected by the government.\n\nSouth Kalimantan is known as \"the land of a thousand rivers\", it is due to the large number of rivers in South Kalimantan. From these rivers, one of the well-known rivers is the [[Barito River]], whose name is based on the Barito region (formerly ''Onder Afdeeling Barito'') which is upstream including [[Central Kalimantan]], but is often used to name all of the watershed to its mouth at the [[Java Sea]] in South Kalimantan is called Muara Banjar/Kuala Banjar. Barito River is commonly used for buying and selling floating markets. In addition, there is also the [[Martapura River]], a tributary of the Barito, which is located in the city of Banjarmasin and in the upper part is the city of [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]], the capital of [[Banjar Regency]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis region has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season.

The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.\n\n== Government ==\nThe Province of South Kalimantan is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.\n\nWhile the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.\n\n=== Administrative Divisions ===\n[[File:Kantor Gubernur Kalimantan Selatan.jpg|thumb|South

consisting of three groups, namely Banjar Kuala, Banjar Pahuluan and Banjar Batang Banyu. The second largest ethnic group is the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] (14.51%) who occupy the transmigration area. Other ethnic groups also exist in South Kalimantan.\n\nBased on the 2010 population census the Banjar people numbered 4.1&nbsp;million. About 2.7&nbsp;million Banjar people live in South Kalimantan and 1 million Banjar people live in other Kalimantan regions and 500 thousand other Banjars live outside Kalimantan. The Banjar people originated from the Banjar area, which is a mix of communities in several rivers, namely Bahan, Barito, Martapura and Tabanio. From this central cultural area, the Banjar tribe has since moved extensively for centrifugal migration or jumping of frogs to various regions in the archipelago to [[Madagascar]].\n\nThe Tionghoa Parit ([[Banjar language|Banjarese]]: ''Cina Parit'') is a sub-group of the [[Chinese Indonesians]]. They inhabit the Parit river area in Pelaihari, [[Tanah Laut Regency]], South Kalimantan. In the daily term, the Chinese are called ''Cina Parit'' by the Banjar people and it is quite difficult for the Banjar tongue to pronounce ''Tionghoa Parit'', and in fact the Chinese people in Banjarmasin live in the Chinatown area which consists of the Pacinan Laut Village (near the river) and Pacinan Darat Village (from the river). The Chinese community call themselves as ''Tionghoa Parit'' instead of ''Cina Parit.''\n\nThe [[Dayak people|Dayak]] is one of the original inhabitants of the province. They occupy the [[Meratus Mountains]] region and the [[Barito River]] flow to [[Central Kalimantan]].\n\n===Language===\nThe language used in everyday life by Banjarese as a mother tongue and as a lingua franca for the people of South Kalimantan generally is the [[Banjar language]] which has two major dialects, namely Banjar Kuala dialects and Banjar Hulu dialect.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://multitree.org/codes/bjn-kua |title = Kuala \u2013 MultiTree}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://multitree.org/codes/bjn-hul |title = Hulu \u2013 MultiTree}}</ref> [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes who inhabit the southern region of the Meratus mountains spoke the Dayak Meratus language.\n\nThe Dayak Dusmala (Dusun-Maanyan-Lawangan) that use Eastern Barito language inhabit the northern region of the Meratus Mountains uses the Dayak Maanyan Warukin language, Dayak Samihin language, Dayak Dusun Deyah language, Dayak Lawangan language, and Dayak Abal language . While the Dayak Biaju that uses the Western Barito language inhabits the streams of the [[Barito River]] uses numerous language among others Dayak Bakumpai language\u00a0 and Dayak Barangas language . The [[Ngaju language|Dayak Ngaju]] language, a language originating from Central Kalimantan is used as a liturgical language in the Borneo Evangelical Church headquartered in [[Banjarmasin]].\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as a second language and also for interethnic communication.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Islam]] is the majority religion adhered to around 96% of people in South Kalimantan. There was also Christian, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] communities as well as the [[Kaharingan]] belief embraced by the Dayak people who lived around the Meratus Mountains region.\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Religion South Kalimantan\">\nFile:Masjid Jami Banjarmasin (2).jpg| Banjarmasin Great Mosque\nFile:GPIB Banjarmasin.jpg|Protestant Church of Western Indonesia in Banjarmasin\nFile:Klenteng Soetji Nurani.jpg|Klenteng Soetji Nurani\nFile:GKE Eppata Banjarmasin.jpg|Evangelist Kalimantan Church of Eppata in Banjarmasin\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Traditional Music ===\n[[File:Tari Baksa Kembang.jpg|thumb|Banjarese women performing ''Tari Baksa Kembang'']]\nOne of the arts in the form of traditional music typical of the Banjar people is ''Panting''. This music is called ''Panting'' because it is dominated by musical instruments called panting, a type of stringed instrument that uses strings (important) so it is called important music. Initially, the music came from the [[Tapin Regency|Tapin]] area, South Kalimantan. ''Panting'' is a musical instrument that is picked which is shaped like an Arab cork but is smaller in size. In the past, ''panting'' music was only played individually or solo. The name of the important music comes from the name of the musical instrument itself, because in important music that is famous for its musical instruments and which plays a very important role. Until now, ''panting''\u00a0 is still famous as traditional music originating from South Kalimantan.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/sejarah-dan-peranan-musik-panting/ Musik Panting Banjar]</ref>\n\nBesides that, there is a traditional Banjar music art, namely ''Kentung''. This music comes from the [[Banjar Regency]] area, namely in the village of Sungai Alat, Astambul and the village of Bincau, [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]]. At present, this kentung music has begun to scarce. The past of this musical instrument was contested. In this match not only the sound, but also the things that are magical, such as if in the match this instrument can be broken or cannot be heard from the opponent's competition.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/musik-kentung/ Musik Kentung Banjar]</ref>\n\n=== Traditional Dance ===\n[[File:Nanang Galuh Banjar.jpg|thumb|Banjarese traditional clothes]]\nBroadly speaking, dance from South Kalimantan is from the indigenous ethnic culture of Banjar and ethnic Dayaks. Banjar dance evolved from the time of the Banjar Sultanate and was influenced by [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Malay culture]], such as ''Japin'' Dance and ''Baksa Kembang'' Dance.\n\nBanjar dance art is divided into two, namely dance developed in the palace (palace), and dance art developed by the people. Kraton dance is marked by the name \"Baksa\" which comes from the [[Javanese language]] (beksan) which signifies the smoothness of motion in the dance. These dances have been around for hundreds of years, since the Hindu era, but the movements and clothing have been adapted to the current situation and conditions. For example, certain movements that are considered incompatible with Islamic [[Adab (Islam)|adab]] change a little.\n\n=== Traditional House ===\n{{Main|Banjarese architecture}}\n[[File:Rumah Bubungan Tinggi Anjungan Kalsel TMII Jakarta.JPG|thumb|A ''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi'']]\n'''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi''' or '''Rumah Banjar''' or '''Rumah Ba-anjung''' is the most iconic type of house in South Kalimantan. In the old kingdom time, this house is the core building in a complex of a palace. This particular house is where the King and his family would reside. Since 1850, there are various building around it with their own respective functions. The name \"Bubungan Tinggi\" refers to its sharp roof (45 degrees steep). This type of house became so popular, that people out of the royalty also took interest in building it. Hence, there are houses with this type of architecture all over South Kalimantan, and even crossing the borders of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. This type of house, of course, took more money than the usual house, so it was naturally the house of the rich.\n\nNowadays most [[Banjar people]] have little interest in building Bubungan Tinggi. Beside the fact that it takes a lot of money to build, people nowadays prefer the \"modern\" type of house. Its cultural values, however, are still appreciated. It is the main figure in both South Kalimantan and [[Banjarmasin]]'s coat of arms. Many of the modern governmental buildings are built with its traits.\n\n=== Theater ===\n[[File:Wayang Banjar HST 151102007.jpg|thumb|Banjarese men performing the ''Wayang Banjar'']]\nThe only traditional theater art that developed on the island of Borneo was ''Mamanda''. Mamanda is theater art or traditional performances originating from South Kalimantan. Compared to other performing arts, ''Mamanda'' is more similar to ''[[Lenong]]'' in terms of the relationship between players and spectators. This interaction made the audience become active in conveying funny comments which allegedly could make the atmosphere more lively.<ref name=\"Mamanda\">[http://www.vivaborneo.com/mamanda-seni-pementasan-pulau-kalimantan.htm Viva Borneo \u2013 Mamanda, Seni Pementasan Pulau Kalimantan]</ref>\n\nThe difference is ''Lenong'' art is now more in line with the times than the monotonous Mamanda in the royal storyline, since in ''Mamanda'' art the characters played are standard figures such as Raja, Prime Minister, Mangkubumi, Wazir, Commander-in-Chief, First Hope, Second Hope, Khadam (Clown/aide), Empress and Sandut (Putri).<ref name=\"Mamanda\" />\n\nThese characters must be present in every performance. In order not to be left behind, ''Mamanda's'' figures were often added with other figures such as the King from another kingdom, pirates, genie, companies and other additional figures to enrich the story.\n\nIt was alleged that the term ''Mamanda'' was used because in the play, players such as the Vizier, Minister, and Mangkubumi were called the pamanda or mamanda by the King. ''Mamanda'' etymologically consists of the word ''mama'' (mamarina) which means uncle in Banjar language and ''nda'' which means honorable. So ''mamanda'' means honorable uncle. That is \"greeting\" to uncles who are respected in the kinship system or family.<ref name=\"Mamanda\" />\n\n=== Traditional Weapon ===\n''[[Kris]]'' is one of the traditional weapons in South Kalimantan. The size is at least 30&nbsp;cm long and the eyes are stuck in another. Weapons made of iron mixed with other metals.\n\n[[Mandau (knife)|''Mandau'']], also called Parang Ilang, is a short-stemmed machete. Mandau became the main identity and weapon of the Dayak community in addition to other machete types. In general, Dayak tribes inhabiting the island of Borneo have several types of machete sharp weapons which are divided into two types, namely inland Dayak and coastal Dayak.\n\n''Sungga'' is one of the weapons used in the [[Banjarmasin War|Banjar War]] in the Gunung Madang Fort area, Kandangan, [[South Hulu Sungai Regency|Hulu Sungai Selatan]]. This weapon was installed under a bridge that was made as a trap, so that when traversed by the enemy ([[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]]), then the bridge will collapse and the enemy that fell stuck on the ''sungga''.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2010, South Kalimantan's exports grew by 27%, the highest increase among all Indonesian provinces. The province's total exports rank seventh out of all provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/13/s-kalimantan-export-growth-best-ri.html|title=S.

Know Your Friend, p26.jpg|thumb|Diamond mining in Martapura]]\nThe agricultural sector is the sector that absorbs the most labor. In February 2012, 38.20 percent of the workforce was absorbed by the agricultural sector. The trade sector is the second largest sector in employment, which is 20.59 percent. The status of workers in South Kalimantan is still dominated by workers who work in the informal sector. In February 2012, 63.20 percent were workers in the informal sector. Most of the workers were self-employed (19.66 percent), tried to be assisted by temporary workers (18.92 percent) and free workers and unpaid workers (24.61 percent). Workers in the formal sector were recorded at 36.80 percent, consisting of workers with labor / employee status (33.35 percent) and working status assisted by permanent workers (3.45 percent).<ref>[http://kalsel.bps.go.id/file%20brs/BRS_naker_7_Mei_2012_kalsel.pdf Keadaan Ketenagakerjaan Kalimantan Selatan Februari 2012].

Diakses pada 5 Oktober 2012</ref>\n\n=== Finance and Banking ===\nJudging from its performance in 2009, banks in South Kalimantan recorded lower growth compared to the previous year as a result of the global financial crisis. However, some indicators still recorded positive growth. The volume of South Kalimantan's banking business (assets) grew 13.3% from the end of 2008 to reach Rp21.24&nbsp;trillion. This asset growth is mainly supported by credit growth and deposits.\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Schepen van de KPM langs de kade aan de Martapura-rivier Bandjermasin TMnr 60018680.jpg|thumb|Ships on the Martapura River during the Dutch colonial era]]\nPublic funds collected by South Kalimantan banking at the end of 2009 reached IDR 18.33&nbsp;trillion or grew by 13% (y-o-y). all types of accounts in the form of demand deposits, savings accounts, and time deposits show positive growth of 10.51% (y-o-y), 17% (y-o-y), and 5.86% (y-o-y), respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of lending, at the end of December 2009 the amount of loans disbursed reached Rp13.95&nbsp;trillion or grew by 16% (y-o-y). This credit growth was mainly supported by consumption credit and investment credit which grew quite high at 24.81% (y-o-y) and 30.42% (y-o-y).\n\nWith these developments, the banking intermediation function reflected by the LDR (Loan to Deposit Ratio) ratio in 2009 showed an increase, from 74% in 2008 to 75.7%. Meanwhile, thanks to the hard work of all the authorities, credit risk was maintained at a safe level in 2009 with an NPL ratio of 2.14% lower than the NPL ratio at the end of 2008 which reached 4.76%.<ref>[http://www.kalselprov.go.id/data-pokok/perbankan Perbankan]. www.kalselprov.go.id.

Comparison of the use of land and water transportation for the South Kalimantan region is quite balanced. This is due to the geographical factor of the South Kalimantan region which has many rivers and swamps, especially for the [[Banjarmasin]] area which is divided by rivers.\n\nA road highways connects [[Palangka Raya]] in [[Central Kalimantan]] and [[Banjarmasin]]. The distance from Palangka Raya to Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan, for example, can be taken from 3 to 4 hours with a distance of about 180&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-3563703/jalan-mulus-menuju-palangka-raya-yang-bebas-macet|title=Jalan Mulus Menuju Palangka Raya yang Bebas Macet|last=Simorangkir|first=Eduardo|website=detikfinance|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> Another highway also connects Banjarmasin to [[Balikpapan]] in [[East Kalimantan]]. The distance from Banjarmasin to Balikpapan can be taken around 11 to 12 hours with a distance about 470&nbsp;km. Most of the road in South Kalimantan has been asphalted, however, there are some roads in the interior part of the province that is in a very poor condition. As there are many rivers in South Kalimantan, many bridges have been built to accommodate cars. Currently, the provincial government has disbursed funds of Rp 200&nbsp;billion to continue the construction of a bridge that connects [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaru]] in [[Laut Island]] and [[Batulicin]] in the mainland. Construction is now still in the planning stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kalsel.antaranews.com/berita/73905/kalsel-kucurkan-rp200-miliar-jembatan-batulicin-kotabaru|title=Kalsel kucurkan Rp200 miliar jembatan Batulicin-Kotabaru \u2013 ANTARA News Kalimantan Selatan|last=Agency|first=ANTARA News|website=Antara News|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Syamsudin Noor International Airport]] is the main airport of Banjarmasin as well as the province in a whole.

However, the government is currently considering building a railway line between [[Batulicin]] and [[Banjarbaru]], which would be part of the Trans-Kalimantan railway system. This would cut the trip from the originally 5 hours by road to only 2 hours. Until now, the government still has not determined the cooperation scheme for railways in South Kalimantan, whether it is purely a collaboration between the government and other business entities. Is the city district with its assets its beneficiaries, while the business entity to carry out its operations is still awaiting its continuation. The first segment, will connect [[Kandangan]] in [[South Hulu Sungai Regency]] and Rantau in [[Tapin Regency]].

({{lang-id|Kalimantan Selatan}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]. It is located in [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian territory of [[Borneo]]. The provincial capital is [[Banjarmasin]]. The population of South Kalimantan was recorded at just over 3.625&nbsp;million people at the 2010 Census,<ref name=\"bps20102\">[http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf Central Bureau of Statistics: ''Census 2010''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113144717/http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf|date=November 13, 2010}}. Retrieved January 17, 2011 {{in lang|id}}</ref> and at nearly 4 million at the 2015 Census;<ref name=\"Badan Pusat Statistik 2018\">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018.</ref> the latest official estimate (for 2017) is 4,119,794. One of five Indonesian provinces in Kalimantan, it is bordered by the [[Makassar Strait]] in the east, [[Central Kalimantan]] in the west and north, the [[Java Sea]] in the south, and [[East Kalimantan]] in the north. The province also includes the island of [[Laut Island|Laut]], located off the eastern coast of Kalimantan. The province is divided into 11 regencies and 2 cities. South Kalimantan is the traditional homeland of the [[Banjar people]], although there are some part of [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]] that is also included in this criteria. Nevertheless, South Kalimantan, especially the capital city [[Banjarmasin]] has always\u00a0 be the cultural capital of Banjarese culture. Many Banjarese has migrated to other parts of Indonesia, as well as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and [[Malaysia]]. In addition, other ethnic groups also inhabit the province, such as several group of the [[Dayaks]], who mostly live in the interior part of the province, as well as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], who mostly migrated from [[Java]] due to the [[Transmigration program]] which dated from the Dutch colonial era.\n\nThe history of South Kalimantan was synonymous with the establishment of the Kingdom of Tanjung Puri around the 5th to 6th century AD. This kingdom is strategically located at the foot of the [[Meratus Mountains]] and on the banks of a large river so that later it becomes a fairly well-developed city. Soon after, the Kingdom of Negara Dipa was established by immigrants from Java. In the 15th century, an attack from Java nearly destroyed this Kingdom of Dipa. To save the kingdom, the new dynasty led by Maharaja Sari Kaburangi immediately ascended the throne and moved the center of government towards the downstream, namely towards the sea at Muhara Rampiau. The Kingdom of Dipa avoided total destruction, it renamed itself as the Kingdom of [[Negara Daha]]. The [[Negara Daha]] eventually suffered a setback with the emergence of a power struggle that took place since Raden Samudra took up arms from the direction of the estuary, in addition to also establishing settlement for the [[Vicegerent|''patih'']] who were in the estuary. This settlement would form the predecessor of the modern-city of [[Banjarmasin]]. With help from Mangkubumi Aria Taranggana, Raden Samudra converted to [[Islam]] on September 24, 1526, changing his name to Sultan Suriansyah, and changed the name of Negara Daha to the [[Sultanate of Banjar]]. Banjar at first paid tribute to the [[Sultanate of Demak]]. That state met its demise in the mid-16th century, however, and Banjar was not required to send tribute to new power in [[Java]], the [[Kingdom of Pajang|Sultanate of Pajang]]. Banjar rose in the first decades of the 17th century as a producer and trader of [[Cubeb|pepper]]. Soon, virtually all of the southwest, southeast, and eastern areas of Kalimantan island were paying tribute to the sultanate. [[Sultan Agung]] of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] (1613\u20131646), who ruled north Java coastal ports such as [[Jepara]], [[Gresik]], [[Tuban]], [[Madura]] and [[Surabaya]], planned to colonise the Banjar-dominated areas of Kalimantan in 1622, but the plan was cancelled due to inadequate resources. Europeans began arriving in the region in the 16th century. The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] initially built a trade post in the region, but was expelled by the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. After the war ended, the British returned the region to the Dutch. A new round of history in South Kalimantan began with the rise of the people against the Dutch. [[Prince Antasari]] led the resistance against the Dutch, whom eventually abolished the sultanate, while Sultan Muhammad Seman who became its leader died in battle. Since then South Kalimantan has been fully controlled by the Dutch. Japanese forces took control of the region in 1942, resulting in the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|three years of brutal occupation]] before [[Surrender of Japan|surrendering]] in 1945. The Dutch briefly return to assume control, but this resulted in a [[Indonesian National Revolution|nationwide resistance]]. In 1949, the Dutch left and control of the region was handed to the new [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]].\n\n==History==\n=== Etymology ===\nSouth Kalimantan is known as the Land of Lambung Mangkurat ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Bumi Lambung Mangkurat'').<ref name=\"De kroniek van Bandjarmasin\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ctwBAAAAMAAJ&q=Lamboeng+Mangkoerat&dq=De+kroniek+van+Bandjarmasin|title=De kroniek van Bandjarmasin|last=Cense|first=Anton Abraham|publisher=C.A.

The existence of the Maanyan mythology tells the golden age of the Nan Sarunai Kingdom, an ancient kingdom that used to unite the Maanyan people in this area and has made connections with the island of [[Madagascar]] off the coast of Africa. One of the archaeological remains from this era is the Great Temple located in the town of Amuntai.

Francois-Xavier Ricaut has shown that the [[Malagasy people]] in Madagascar genetic diversity is 68 percent of Africans and 32 percent of Asians. Based on their evidence, Banjar is the Asian population that is most likely to travel to Madagascar. Genetic dating supports the hypothesis that Austronesian migration occurred about 1,000 years ago, while the last significant [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migration to Madagascar began 300 years later, perhaps after climate change in Africa. Language shifts are thought to have occurred in Southeast Kalimantan after Banjar migration to Madagascar. It is estimated that the [[Banjar people]], who currently speak Malay, may speak a language closer to the language reconstructed for Proto-Malagasy. This linguistic change will follow the main cultural and genetic mix with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], driven by the trade post of the Malay Empire in Southeast Kalimantan.

Prince Nata Dilaga who became the first king of the dynasty Tamjidullah I in his heyday of power, declared himself as ''Susuhunan Nata Alam'' in 1772. The son of Sultan Muhammad Aliuddin Aminullah named Prince Amir, or grandson of Sultan Hamidullah fled to the Paser Kingdom, and asked his uncle for help named Arung Tarawe (and Queen Goddess). Prince Amir then returned and invaded the Banjar Sultanate with a large [[Buginese people|Buginese]] army in 1757, and tried to reclaim his throne from Susuhunan Nata Alam. Fearing the loss of the throne and worries about the fall of the kingdom under the rule of the Bugis, Susuhunan Nata Alam requested assistance from the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).\n\nThe VOC accepted the request and sent Captain Hoffman with his forces and succeeded in defeating the Buginese forces. Prince Amir was forced to flee back to the Paser Kingdom. Some time later Prince Amir also tried to ask for help from the Banjar nobles in the [[Barito River|Barito]] area who were not happy with the Dutch presence. In this second battle, Prince Amir was captured and was exiled to [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]] in 1787. After that an agreement was made between the Sultanate of Banjar and the VOC, where the kings of the Banjar ruled the kingdom as borrowers of VOC land. In 1826 a re-agreement was held between the [[Dutch East Indies]] Government and Sultan Adam, based on the previous agreement VOC. According to this agreement, the Dutch are allowed to interfere with the regulation of issues regarding the appointment of the Crown Prince and the ''Mangkubumi'', which resulted in the destruction of royal customs in this field, which then made one of the causes of the outbreak of the [[Banjarmasin War]].\n[[File:1._ZM_Stoomschip_Celebes_in_gevecht_met_een_Kota_Mara_6_aug_1859_Poeloe_Kananat_opgenomen.jpg|thumb|The steamship ''Celebes'' fighting with armed Dayak vessels]]\nThe Banjarmasin War took place between 1859 and 1905 (1859\u20131863 according to Dutch sources).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aw44lFhJq6QC&lpg=PT48&dq=pangeran%20antasari&pg=PT48#v=onepage&q=pangeran%20antasari&f=false|title=Pengetahuan Sosial Sejarah 2|author=Drs.

Immediately after the capture of [[Balikpapan]] on January 26, 1942, the 56th Mixed Infantry Group was ordered to complete the occupation of Dutch Borneo by invading Bandjermasin, its capital. During the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1942)|Battle of Balikpapan]] and also after the occupation of the city, all efforts were made to gather information from Japanese residents, natives and prisoners of war. Reconnaissance flights in the area were carried out by naval air units. It was necessary to capture Bandjermasin, as soon as possible, to secure its airfield for combat aircraft scheduled to participate in the [[Battle of Java (1942)|Java Operation]].\n\nA Sea Drive Unit under command of Captain Yoshibumi Okamoto left Balikpapan on the evening of January 27, 1942, three days ahead of the main Land Drive Unit. The craft moved only at night and were carefully concealed in the river banks during the daylight hours and camouflaged with mangrove branches, while the troops were resting in the forest, so that they were completely hidden from aerial reconnaissance planes. Radio silence was maintained all the time. One naval officer was attached to the unit as a pilot. The surprise night attack was successfully carried out on the town of [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaroe]] on [[Laut Island|Laoet Island]], as planned. Very little resistance was encountered and a large quantity of military supplies and provisions was captured.\n\nApparently the local administrative governor wasn't very pleased with his territorial commander and he asked the main [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) HQ on [[Java]] for a replacement. The replacement commander was on his way by airplane, but returned as they saw Bandjarmasin was on fire and they thought, although wrongly, that it was already occupied by Japanese troops and perhaps it would be unwise to attempt a landing. The Okamoto's unit landed at a point approximately 80&nbsp;km southeast of Bandjarmasin on February 8, 1942 and advanced overland without opposition, to the airfield. As the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed the enemy, there was no fighting after the Sea Drive Unit reached the Martapoera airfield on February 10, 1942.\n\nAt 0900 on February 10, the [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapoera]] airfield was captured by the Advance Force together with the Engineer Company. By the evening of February 10, with the arrival of the main force and the Sea Land Unit, Bandjermasin was finally occupied. There was no fighting.\n\nLieutenant Colonel H. T. Halkema came by sea to the [[Barito River]], with his staff, accompanied by elements of units under his command. By now many KNIL native soldiers had already deserted with defeat of the colonial Dutch lingering in the air. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema received orders to proceed to Kotawarangin airfield. When he arrived there, with only 75 men left under his depleted command, he received an order to have part of his shrunken force, soldiers that were physically capable, to staunchly defend the airfield, while those remnants that are too weak and exhausted should to be sent to Java . Lieutenant Colonel Halkema was later even court-marshalled by the military court (''Hoog Militair Gerechtshof''). In the meantime a brave group of civilians, and military escapees, 180 persons, managed to evade the Japanese aboard a small coaster to [[Madura Island|Madoera Island]], among which also included 20 women.\n\nThe official Japanese casualties during the Bandjermasin operation numbered only 9 soldiers who were killed or died from various diseases, while at least 80% of the men were infected with malaria. The casualties and the number of POWs on the Dutch side are unknown. The distance travelled by land routes was approximately 400&nbsp;km and the distance through jungle approximately 100&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bandjermasin.html|title=The capture of Bandjermasin|last=L|first=Klemen|date=1999\u20132000|work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], Borneo and eastern Indonesia were controlled by the 2nd South Fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].

The Dutch then withdraw from the region, ending the three-century long Dutch presence in the region. The region was initially incorporated into the Indonesian province of Kalimantan, but in 1956 the province was dissolved and separated into two province, [[West Kalimantan]] and South Kalimantan. In 1957 South Kalimantan was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the [[Muslim]] population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on May 23, 1957 under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared [[Central Kalimantan]] the seventeenth province of Indonesia.\n\n==Geography==\nSouth Kalimantan is a province located on the island of Borneo, located between longitude 21 21 49 \"LS, 114 19\" 33 \"BT \u2013 116 33 '28 BT, and 21' 49\" LS 110 \"14\" LS on the map. South Kalimantan has a total area of 37,377.53 km2 and is divided into four regions. These reion are [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaru]] Region which is largest area in South Kalimantan with an area of 13,044.50 km2, Banjar Regionwith an area of 5,039.90 km2, Tabalong Region with an area of 3,039.90 km2, and the city of [[Banjarmasin]] as the narrowest area with an area of 72.00 km2.\n\nGeographically, South Kalimantan is in the southeastern part of the island of [[Borneo]], has a low-lying area in the west and east coast, and a plateau formed by the [[Meratus Mountains]] in the middle. South Kalimantan consists of two main geographic features, namely the lowlands and the highlands. Lowland areas are mostly in the form of peatlands to swamps, which are rich in biodiversity sources of freshwater animals. Some highland areas are still natural tropical forests and protected by the government.\n\nSouth Kalimantan has extensive forests namely Permanent Forests (139,315 ha), Production Forests (1,325,024 ha), Protected Forests (139,315 ha), Convention Forests (348,919 ha). Forestry consists of two types, namely wood and non-wood. The area of forest in South Kalimantan is 1,659,003 ha including; protected forests, natural forests, permanent production forests, limited production forests, conversion forests and mangrove forests. Some are tropical forests and protected by the government.\n\nSouth Kalimantan is known as \"the land of a thousand rivers\", it is due to the large number of rivers in South Kalimantan. From these rivers, one of the well-known rivers is the [[Barito River]], whose name is based on the Barito region (formerly ''Onder Afdeeling Barito'') which is upstream including [[Central Kalimantan]], but is often used to name all of the watershed to its mouth at the [[Java Sea]] in South Kalimantan is called Muara Banjar/Kuala Banjar. Barito River is commonly used for buying and selling floating markets. In addition, there is also the [[Martapura River]], a tributary of the Barito, which is located in the city of Banjarmasin and in the upper part is the city of [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]], the capital of [[Banjar Regency]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis region has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from Australia and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Ocean<nowiki/>during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half-year after passing the transition period in between April \u2013 May and October \u2013 November.{{Weather box|location=Banjarmasin|metric first=Yes|single line=yes|Jan high F=85|Feb high F=85|Mar high F=86|Apr high F=87|May high F=88|Jun high F=87|Jul high F=87|Aug high F=88|Sep high F=88|Oct high F=88|Nov high F=87|Dec high F=85|year high F=87|Jan low F=77|Feb low F=77|Mar low F=76|Apr low F=78|May low F=78|Jun low F=77|Jul low F=75|Aug low F=75|Sep low F=75|Oct low F=77|Nov low F=77|Dec low F=76|year low F=76|Jan precipitation mm=350|Feb precipitation mm=300|Mar precipitation mm=310|Apr precipitation mm=210|May precipitation mm=200|Jun precipitation mm=120|Jul precipitation mm=120|Aug precipitation mm=110|Sep precipitation mm=130|Oct precipitation mm=120|Nov precipitation mm=230|Dec precipitation mm=290|year precipitation mm=2570|source 1=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=58669&refer=&units=metric|date=December 2010}}As in most other province of Indonesia, South Kalimantan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.\n\n== Government ==\nThe Province of South Kalimantan is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.\n\nWhile the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.\n\n=== Administrative Divisions ===\n[[File:Kantor Gubernur Kalimantan Selatan.jpg|thumb|South

consisting of three groups, namely Banjar Kuala, Banjar Pahuluan and Banjar Batang Banyu. The second largest ethnic group is the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] (14.51%) who occupy the transmigration area. Other ethnic groups also exist in South Kalimantan.\n\nBased on the 2010 population census the Banjar people numbered 4.1&nbsp;million. About 2.7&nbsp;million Banjar people live in South Kalimantan and 1 million Banjar people live in other Kalimantan regions and 500 thousand other Banjars live outside Kalimantan. The Banjar people originated from the Banjar area, which is a mix of communities in several rivers, namely Bahan, Barito, Martapura and Tabanio. From this central cultural area, the Banjar tribe has since moved extensively for centrifugal migration or jumping of frogs to various regions in the archipelago to [[Madagascar]].\n\nThe Tionghoa Parit ([[Banjar language|Banjarese]]: ''Cina Parit'') is a sub-group of the [[Chinese Indonesians]]. They inhabit the Parit river area in Pelaihari, [[Tanah Laut Regency]], South Kalimantan. In the daily term, the Chinese are called ''Cina Parit'' by the Banjar people and it is quite difficult for the Banjar tongue to pronounce ''Tionghoa Parit'', and in fact the Chinese people in Banjarmasin live in the Chinatown area which consists of the Pacinan Laut Village (near the river) and Pacinan Darat Village (from the river). The Chinese community call themselves as ''Tionghoa Parit'' instead of ''Cina Parit.''\n\nThe [[Dayak people|Dayak]] is one of the original inhabitants of the province. They occupy the [[Meratus Mountains]] region and the [[Barito River]] flow to [[Central Kalimantan]].\n\n===Language===\nThe language used in everyday life by Banjarese as a mother tongue and as a lingua franca for the people of South Kalimantan generally is the [[Banjar language]] which has two major dialects, namely Banjar Kuala dialects and Banjar Hulu dialect.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://multitree.org/codes/bjn-kua |title = Kuala \u2013 MultiTree}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://multitree.org/codes/bjn-hul |title = Hulu \u2013 MultiTree}}</ref> [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes who inhabit the southern region of the Meratus mountains spoke the Dayak Meratus language.\n\nThe Dayak Dusmala (Dusun-Maanyan-Lawangan) that use Eastern Barito language inhabit the northern region of the Meratus Mountains uses the Dayak Maanyan Warukin language, Dayak Samihin language, Dayak Dusun Deyah language, Dayak Lawangan language, and Dayak Abal language . While the Dayak Biaju that uses the Western Barito language inhabits the streams of the [[Barito River]] uses numerous language among others Dayak Bakumpai language\u00a0 and Dayak Barangas language . The [[Ngaju language|Dayak Ngaju]] language, a language originating from Central Kalimantan is used as a liturgical language in the Borneo Evangelical Church headquartered in [[Banjarmasin]].\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as a second language and also for interethnic communication.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Islam]] is the majority religion adhered to around 96% of people in South Kalimantan. There was also Christian, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] communities as well as the [[Kaharingan]] belief embraced by the Dayak people who lived around the Meratus Mountains region.\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Religion South Kalimantan\">\nFile:Masjid Jami Banjarmasin (2).jpg| Banjarmasin Great Mosque\nFile:GPIB Banjarmasin.jpg|Protestant Church of Western Indonesia in Banjarmasin\nFile:Klenteng Soetji Nurani.jpg|Klenteng Soetji Nurani\nFile:GKE Eppata Banjarmasin.jpg|Evangelist Kalimantan Church of Eppata in Banjarmasin\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Traditional Music ===\n[[File:Tari Baksa Kembang.jpg|thumb|Banjarese women performing ''Tari Baksa Kembang'']]\nOne of the arts in the form of traditional music typical of the Banjar people is ''Panting''. This music is called ''Panting'' because it is dominated by musical instruments called panting, a type of stringed instrument that uses strings (important) so it is called important music. Initially, the music came from the [[Tapin Regency|Tapin]] area, South Kalimantan. ''Panting'' is a musical instrument that is picked which is shaped like an Arab cork but is smaller in size. In the past, ''panting'' music was only played individually or solo. The name of the important music comes from the name of the musical instrument itself, because in important music that is famous for its musical instruments and which plays a very important role. Until now, ''panting''\u00a0 is still famous as traditional music originating from South Kalimantan.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/sejarah-dan-peranan-musik-panting/ Musik Panting Banjar]</ref>\n\nBesides that, there is a traditional Banjar music art, namely ''Kentung''. This music comes from the [[Banjar Regency]] area, namely in the village of Sungai Alat, Astambul and the village of Bincau, [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]]. At present, this kentung music has begun to scarce. The past of this musical instrument was contested. In this match not only the sound, but also the things that are magical, such as if in the match this instrument can be broken or cannot be heard from the opponent's competition.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/musik-kentung/ Musik Kentung Banjar]</ref>\n\n=== Traditional Dance ===\n[[File:Nanang Galuh Banjar.jpg|thumb|Banjarese traditional clothes]]\nBroadly speaking, dance from South Kalimantan is from the indigenous ethnic culture of Banjar and ethnic Dayaks. Banjar dance evolved from the time of the Banjar Sultanate and was influenced by [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Malay culture]], such as ''Japin'' Dance and ''Baksa Kembang'' Dance.\n\nBanjar dance art is divided into two, namely dance developed in the palace (palace), and dance art developed by the people. Kraton dance is marked by the name \"Baksa\" which comes from the [[Javanese language]] (beksan) which signifies the smoothness of motion in the dance. These dances have been around for hundreds of years, since the Hindu era, but the movements and clothing have been adapted to the current situation and conditions. For example, certain movements that are considered incompatible with Islamic [[Adab (Islam)|adab]] change a little.\n\n=== Traditional House ===\n{{Main|Banjarese architecture}}\n[[File:Rumah Bubungan Tinggi Anjungan Kalsel TMII Jakarta.JPG|thumb|A ''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi'']]\n'''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi''' or '''Rumah Banjar''' or '''Rumah Ba-anjung''' is the most iconic type of house in South Kalimantan. In the old kingdom time, this house is the core building in a complex of a palace. This particular house is where the King and his family would reside. Since 1850, there are various building around it with their own respective functions. The name \"Bubungan Tinggi\" refers to its sharp roof (45 degrees steep). This type of house became so popular, that people out of the royalty also took interest in building it. Hence, there are houses with this type of architecture all over South Kalimantan, and even crossing the borders of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. This type of house, of course, took more money than the usual house, so it was naturally the house of the rich.\n\nNowadays most [[Banjar people]] have little interest in building Bubungan Tinggi. Beside the fact that it takes a lot of money to build, people nowadays prefer the \"modern\" type of house. Its cultural values, however, are still appreciated. It is the main figure in both South Kalimantan and [[Banjarmasin]]'s coat of arms. Many of the modern governmental buildings are built with its traits.\n\n=== Theater ===\n[[File:Wayang Banjar HST 151102007.jpg|thumb|Banjarese men performing the ''Wayang Banjar'']]\nThe only traditional theater art that developed on the island of Borneo was ''Mamanda''. Mamanda is theater art or traditional performances originating from South Kalimantan. Compared to other performing arts, ''Mamanda'' is more similar to ''[[Lenong]]'' in terms of the relationship between players and spectators. This interaction made the audience become active in conveying funny comments which allegedly could make the atmosphere more lively.<ref name=\"Mamanda\">[http://www.vivaborneo.com/mamanda-seni-pementasan-pulau-kalimantan.htm Viva Borneo \u2013 Mamanda, Seni Pementasan Pulau Kalimantan]</ref>\n\nThe difference is ''Lenong'' art is now more in line with the times than the monotonous Mamanda in the royal storyline, since in ''Mamanda'' art the characters played are standard figures such as Raja, Prime Minister, Mangkubumi, Wazir, Commander-in-Chief, First Hope, Second Hope, Khadam (Clown/aide), Empress and Sandut (Putri).<ref name=\"Mamanda\" />\n\nThese characters must be present in every performance. In order not to be left behind, ''Mamanda's'' figures were often added with other figures such as the King from another kingdom, pirates, genie, companies and other additional figures to enrich the story.\n\nIt was alleged that the term ''Mamanda'' was used because in the play, players such as the Vizier, Minister, and Mangkubumi were called the pamanda or mamanda by the King. ''Mamanda'' etymologically consists of the word ''mama'' (mamarina) which means uncle in Banjar language and ''nda'' which means honorable. So ''mamanda'' means honorable uncle. That is \"greeting\" to uncles who are respected in the kinship system or family.<ref name=\"Mamanda\" />\n\n=== Traditional Weapon ===\n''[[Kris]]'' is one of the traditional weapons in South Kalimantan. The size is at least 30&nbsp;cm long and the eyes are stuck in another. Weapons made of iron mixed with other metals.\n\n[[Mandau (knife)|''Mandau'']], also called Parang Ilang, is a short-stemmed machete. Mandau became the main identity and weapon of the Dayak community in addition to other machete types. In general, Dayak tribes inhabiting the island of Borneo have several types of machete sharp weapons which are divided into two types, namely inland Dayak and coastal Dayak.\n\n''Sungga'' is one of the weapons used in the [[Banjarmasin War|Banjar War]] in the Gunung Madang Fort area, Kandangan, [[South Hulu Sungai Regency|Hulu Sungai Selatan]]. This weapon was installed under a bridge that was made as a trap, so that when traversed by the enemy ([[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]]), then the bridge will collapse and the enemy that fell stuck on the ''sungga''.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2010, South Kalimantan's exports grew by 27%, the highest increase among all Indonesian provinces. The province's total exports rank seventh out of all provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/13/s-kalimantan-export-growth-best-ri.html|title=S.

Later on he learns that Lali belongs to a nomadic community that is at present, inhabiting his region. Ashok meets Lali again and both confess that they are in love with each other. In the meantime Lali's father, who is the head of his community, sends a man named Phulwa to look for her. Phulwa discovers Lali with Prince Ashok. As he has always desired Lali as his better half, he gets jealous and enraged on seeing Lali close the prince. He attacks Ashok, but gets overpowered by him and runs away. Lali becomes upset and fears that Phulwa will take his revenge on them. Phulwa returns to Lali's father and lies to him that Lali has no guts to face her father anymore as she has lost her virginity to the prince, whom he has knocked down on the spot. Lali's father believes what Phulwa has said and orders his gang, along with Phulwa to rob the regal coffer to avenge this insult.\n\nIn the meantime, Ashok and Lali marry and go to meet Lali's father. Her father does not assent to this marriage, considering the fact that their class distinction will be an obstacle in the course of the relationship; besides, he is the one who has ordered the robbing of the coffer. He tells them that he has no objection to this marriage if the queens of the palace can accept Lali as their daughter-in-law, and the prince at first needs to go back to his palace to learn whether Lali will be accepted or not. After Ashok leaves, Lali's father instructs his tribe to pack up and resume their march, leaving Lali behind. Ashok resolves to leave his palace forever and spend the rest of his life with Lali and her community when he learns that she will not be accepted by the queens. He goes back to Lali who was waiting for him to return, and soon they join the march. During the trip, Phulwa replaces Ashok's water bottle with a bottle of poisoned water. Ashok gets thirsty, and Lali, unaware of the fact, gives him that bottle of poisoned water. Ashok falls sick and Lali cannot understand how it happened. The queens, along with cavalry, spot Kumar and Lali. They accuse Lali of having given him the poison. They take Kumar back with them leaving her behind. Kumar is saved ultimately. When he regains his consciousness, the queens misinterpret to him that Lali has given him the poison because all she wanted to have is his wealth, but not his love.\n\nAshok reluctantly marries Mangala, the beautiful princess of Thakur Amar Singh. Mangala comes to know that Ashok is already married to Lali. She feels as if she has been cheated and informs her father all about this. Her father comes to take her back with him and Ashok shoots an arrow in his back to counteract him. Hence Mangala is compelled to stay with Ashok.\n\nLali gives birth to a boy whose father is Ashok, actually. She names her son Ratan and tells him all about her past. One night Ratan meets his somnambulist father in the forest. He saves his father by killing a snake that was about to bite him. The King's men are there at once and they take Ratan to Queen Mangala. Mangala confesses her earnest gratitude towards him for saving her husband's life. She employs Ratan on his request. Ratan befriends Mangala's son. Eventually Mangala gets too fond of Ratan, and Ashok finds it irritating. Ratan meets with an accident while carrying the coffer upstairs. He falls down and has a severe injury to his head. Before his death, Ratan discloses that he is Ashok and Lali's son and his mother never gave the poison. Ashok is heartbroken again. He goes to Lali with the corpse of Ratan and they lament together on the death of their son. After the corpse of their son is cremated, Ashok returns to his palace with Lali on his side. At the door he meets an enraged Mangala with a sword in her hand. She argues that Ashok will have to leave Lali behind if he wants to stay in his palace, because Lali does not belong to the standard to stay there. Ashok counter-argues that as long as everything is his property he has the complete right to decide who will stay in his palace. Lali cannot stand this disquietude anymore. She leaves without uttering a single word and Ashok follows her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Suraiya]] as Laali\n*[[Sumitra Devi (actress)|Sumitra]] as Mangala\n*[[Suresh (Hindi films actor)|Suresh]] as Ashok\n*Sham Kumar\n*Ramesh\n*[[Madan Puri]] as Phulwa\n*Banerji\n*[[Amirbai Karnataki]]\t\t\n*[[Mumtaz Begum (actress)|Mumtazbai]]\n*Neelambai\n*Amir Bano\n*[[Daisy Irani|Roop Kumar]]\t\n*[[Ratan Kumar (actor)|Rattan Kumar]]\n*Amir Ali\n*Nawab\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Deewana\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Naushad]]\n| cover        = \n| released     = 1952\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = \n| label        = \n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]\n| prev_year    = 1952\n| year         = 1952\n| next_title   = [[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]\n| next_year    = 1954\n}}\nThe music for the film was composed by renowned musician [[Naushad]] with lyrics penned by [[Shakeel Badayuni]].\n#\"Mora Nazuk Badan\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Dil Mein Aa Gaya Koi\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Jeene Diya Na Chain Se\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Lagi Hai Manmandir\"  \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Mere Chand Mere Lal\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Tasveer Banata Hoon Teri\" \u2013 [[Mohammed Rafi]]\n#\"Teer Khate Jayenge\" \u2013 [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Yeh Duniya Kaisi Hai\" \u2013 [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Humein Jo Koi Dekhle\" \u2013 [[Shamshad Begum]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0126264|Diwana}}\n*''[http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/movies/cast-crew/diwana/10466/ Diwana]'' on [http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/ BollywoodMDB]\n*''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIh6Xlyq9A/ Diwana] on [https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]\n\n{{A.

Later on he learns that Lali belongs to a nomadic community that is at present, inhabiting his region. Ashok meets Lali again and both confess that they are in love with each other. In the meantime Lali's father, who is the head of his community, sends a man named Phulwa to look for her. Phulwa discovers Lali with Prince Ashok. As he has always desired Lali as his better half, he gets jealous and enraged on seeing Lali close the prince. He attacks Ashok, but gets overpowered by him and runs away. Lali becomes upset and fears that Phulwa will take his revenge on them. Phulwa returns to Lali's father and lies to him that Lali has no guts to face her father anymore as she has lost her virginity to the prince, whom he has knocked down on the spot. Lali's father believes what Phulwa has said and orders his gang, along with Phulwa to rob the regal coffer to avenge this insult.\n\nIn the meantime, Ashok and Lali marry and go to meet Lali's father. Her father does not assent to this marriage, considering the fact that their class distinction will be an obstacle in the course of the relationship; besides, he is the one who has ordered the robbing of the coffer. He tells them that he has no objection to this marriage if the queens of the palace can accept Lali as their daughter-in-law, and the prince at first needs to go back to his palace to learn whether Lali will be accepted or not. After Ashok leaves, Lali's father instructs his tribe to pack up and resume their march, leaving Lali behind. Ashok resolves to leave his palace forever and spend the rest of his life with Lali and her community when he learns that she will not be accepted by the queens. He goes back to Lali who was waiting for him to return, and soon they join the march. During the trip, Phulwa replaces Ashok's water bottle with a bottle of poisoned water. Ashok gets thirsty, and Lali, unaware of the fact, gives him that bottle of poisoned water. Ashok falls sick and Lali cannot understand how it happened. The queens, along with cavalry, spot Kumar and Lali. They accuse Lali of having given him the poison. They take Kumar back with them leaving her behind. Kumar is saved ultimately. When he regains his consciousness, the queens misinterpret to him that Lali has given him the poison because all she wanted to have is his wealth, but not his love.\n\nAshok reluctantly gets married to Mangala, the beautiful princess of Thakur Amar Singh. Mangala comes to know that Ashok is already married to Lali. She feels as if she has been cheated and informs her father all about this. Her father comes to take her back with him and Ashok shoots an arrow in his back to counteract him. Hence Mangala is compelled to stay with Ashok.\n\nLali gives birth to a boy whose father is Ashok, actually. She names her son Ratan and tells him all about her past. One night Ratan meets his somnambulist father in the forest. He saves his father by killing a snake that was about to bite him. The King's men are there at once and they take Ratan to Queen Mangala. Mangala confesses her earnest gratitude towards him for saving her husband's life. She employs Ratan on his request. Ratan befriends Mangala's son. Eventually Mangala gets too fond of Ratan, and Ashok finds it irritating. Ratan meets with an accident while carrying the coffer upstairs. He falls down and has a severe injury to his head. Before his death, Ratan discloses that he is Ashok and Lali's son and his mother never gave the poison. Ashok is heartbroken again. He goes to Lali with the corpse of Ratan and they lament together on the death of their son. After the corpse of their son is cremated, Ashok returns to his palace with Lali on his side. At the door he meets an enraged Mangala with a sword in her hand. She argues that Ashok will have to leave Lali behind if he wants to stay in his palace, because Lali does not belong to the standard to stay there. Ashok counter-argues that as long as everything is his property he has the complete right to decide who will stay in his palace. Lali cannot stand this disquietude anymore. She leaves without uttering a single word and Ashok follows her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Suraiya]] as Laali\n*[[Sumitra Devi (actress)|Sumitra]] as Mangala\n*[[Suresh (Hindi films actor)|Suresh]] as Ashok\n*Sham Kumar\n*Ramesh\n*[[Madan Puri]] as Phulwa\n*Banerji\n*[[Amirbai Karnataki]]\t\t\n*[[Mumtaz Begum (actress)|Mumtazbai]]\n*Neelambai\n*Amir Bano\n*[[Daisy Irani|Roop Kumar]]\t\n*[[Ratan Kumar (actor)|Rattan Kumar]]\n*Amir Ali\n*Nawab\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Deewana\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Naushad]]\n| cover        = \n| released     = 1952\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = \n| label        = \n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]\n| prev_year    = 1952\n| year         = 1952\n| next_title   = [[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]\n| next_year    = 1954\n}}\nThe music for the film was composed by renowned musician [[Naushad]] with lyrics penned by [[Shakeel Badayuni]].\n#\"Mora Nazuk Badan\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Dil Mein Aa Gaya Koi\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Jeene Diya Na Chain Se\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Lagi Hai Manmandir\"  \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Mere Chand Mere Lal\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Tasveer Banata Hoon Teri\" \u2013 [[Mohammed Rafi]]\n#\"Teer Khate Jayenge\" \u2013 [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Yeh Duniya Kaisi Hai\" \u2013 [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Humein Jo Koi Dekhle\" \u2013 [[Shamshad Begum]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0126264|Diwana}}\n*''[http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/movies/cast-crew/diwana/10466/ Diwana]'' on [http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/ BollywoodMDB]\n*''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIh6Xlyq9A/ Diwana] on [https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]\n\n{{A.
