It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L. Sullivan, \"Reaching Behind Bars: Library Outreach to Prisoners, 1798\u20132000\", ''The Prison Library Primer: A Program for the Twenty-first Century'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Since 1900===\n[[Image:Sing Sing (prison) with warden.jpg|thumb|left|Warden T. M. Osborne]]\n\n[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]'s tenure as warden of Sing Sing was brief but dramatic. Osborne arrived in 1914 with a reputation as a radical prison reformer. His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Prison]] indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=33255|name=Within Prison Walls: Being a Narrative of Personal Experience During a Week of Voluntary Confinement in the State Prison at Auburn, New York|author=[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]|year=1914|bullet=none}}</ref>\n\nPrisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne's regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne's reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration. After Osborne triumphed in court, his return to Sing Sing was a cause for wild celebration by the inmates.<ref>Denis Brian, ''Sing Sing: The Inside Story of a Notorious Prison'', 85-112.</ref><ref>''The New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902E6D9173BE633A25754C1A9619C946796D6CF \"Convicts' Carnival Welcomes Osborne\"], July 17, 1916.

He was offered the position of warden in 1919, accepted in January 1920, and remained for 21 years as Sing Sing's warden. While warden, Lawes brought about reforms and turned what was described as an \"old hellhole\" into a modern prison with sports teams, educational programs, new methods of discipline and more.

Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitation of incarcerated people, inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college degree-granting program.

The [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] teams, and the vaudeville presentations and concerts, were funded through revenue from paid attendance. [[Tim Mara]], the owner of the [[New York Giants]], sponsored the Sing Sing Black Sheep, Sing Sing's football team. Mara provided equipment and uniforms and players to tutor them in fundamentals. He helped coach them the first season. Known as the Black Sheep, they were also sometimes called the Zebras. All games were \"home\" games, played at Lawes Stadium, named for Warden [[Lewis E. Lawes]]. In 1935, the starting quarterback and two other starters escaped the morning before a game.\n\n[[Alabama Pitts]] was their starting QB and star for the first four seasons, but then finished his sentence. Upon release, Alabama Pitts played for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 1935. In 1932, \"graduate\" [[Jumbo Morano]] was signed by the Giants, and played for the [[Paterson Nighthawks]] of the [[Eastern Football League (United States)|Eastern Football League]]. In 1934, State Commissioner of Correction, [[Walter N. Thayer]] banned the advertising of activities at the prison, including football games. On November 19, 1936, a new rule banned ticket sales. No revenues would be derived from show and sports event ticketing. These funds had been paying for disbursements to prisoners' families, especially the kin of those executed, and for equipment and coaches' salaries. With this new edict, the season ended and prisoners were no longer allowed to play football outside Sing Sing.<ref>''Sing Sing Football Records'': [http://www.luckyshow.org/football/Sing%20Sing.htm \"Sing Sing\"].

It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L.

His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Prison]] indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=33255|name=Within Prison Walls: Being a Narrative of Personal Experience During a Week of Voluntary Confinement in the State Prison at Auburn, New York|author=[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]|year=1914|bullet=none}}</ref>\n\nPrisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne's regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne's reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration.
