The bridge was designed by [[Ernest de Burgh]] and built in 1901. The bridge is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1470>{{cite NSW SHR|5051372|Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|hr=01470|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nAllan trusses were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n===Paterson River bridge===\n\nThe bridge project to replace the existing steam ferry was initiated in 1898, when a contract of was let for its construction for [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]9,845. A further project of {{convert|110|chain|m|order=flip}} of road to connect the new bridge to the [[Morpeth Bridge]] was initiated in the same year. The contractor for the work was S. McGill, the same contractor as the Morpeth Bridge. The iron and steel work was provided by Messrs. Pope, Maher and Company, and the steel ropes for the lifting span manufactured by Messrs. Bullivant and Co.<ref name=md>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138469571 |title=MAITLAND DISTRICT |newspaper=[[Newcastle Morning Herald And Miners' Advocate]] |issue=8191 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=14 February 1901 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was designed by [[Ernest de Burgh]], Assistant Engineer for Bridges in the Public Works department, under the direction of Under-Secretary for Public Works and Commissioner for Roads Hickson.

It has two external timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|28|m|ft}} and one internal steel truss [[Vertical lift bridge|lift span]] of {{convert|17.8|m|ft}}. There are seven timber approach spans at one end and three at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|178.6|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nThe bridge is {{convert|14.3|m|ft|0}} above the high water line and the centre lift span previously rose another {{convert|7.9|m|ft|0}}. The lifting span was fixed in position in 1940 as the need for river steamers ceased.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nThe internal lift span is supported by twin cast iron cylinders. The timber truss spans are supported by timber trestles. The superstructure provides a carriageway with a minimum width of 5.1m. Guard rails are of post and rail construction over the approach and timber truss spans.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nIt was reported to be in good condition and to be intact as at 13 September 2005.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nCompleted in 1901, Hinton Bridge is an Allan timber truss road bridge, and has a lift span which in the past accommodated river steamers that travelled the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] system. Hinton is one of only three lift bridges in the Hunter region. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Hinton bridge is in the [[Hunter Region]], which has 15 historic road bridges each constructed before 1905. It gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. Hinton bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nThe Hinton Bridge over Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe bridge is highly valued by the nearby Hinton community. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is highly rare because of its lift span and age.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is representative of Allan timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019478}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|work=Roads and Traffic Authority|date=2007|title=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301090}}\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|dno=5051372|id=01470|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Paterson River bridge, Hinton}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n{{Hunter Region places and items of interest}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1901]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Allan truss bridges]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:City of Maitland]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: Hinton Bridge over Paterson River SHRNo:1470 DatabaseNo:5051372 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox bridge\n| name                = Hinton Bridge\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| image               = Hinton Bridge.jpg\n| image_upright       = 1.4\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| pushpin_map         = New South Wales\n| pushpin_relief      = 1\n| pushpin_map_size    = 270\n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in [[New South Wales]]\n| coordinates         = {{Coord|-32.7141|151.6478|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title|format=dms}}<!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| os_grid_reference   = \n| qid                 = \n| refs                = \n| carries             = Hinton-Morpeth Road\n| crosses             = [[Paterson River]]\n| locale              = [[Hinton, New South Wales|Hinton]], [[City of Maitland]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| starts              = \n| ends                = \n| official_name       = \n| other_name          = \n| named_for           = \n| owner               = [[Roads and Maritime Services]]\n| maint               = \n| heritage            = \n| id                  = \n| id_type             = \n| website             = \n| preceded            = \n| followed            = \n| design              = [[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan-type truss]]\n| material            = Timber\n| material1           = \n| material2           = \n| length              = \n| width               = \n| height              = \n| depth               = \n| traversable         = \n| towpath             = \n| mainspan            = \n| number_spans        = \n| piers_in_water      = \n| load                = \n| clearance_above     = \n| clearance_below     = \n| lanes               = \n| life                = \n| first_length        = \n| first_diameter      = \n| second_length       = \n| second_diameter     = \n| third_length        = \n| third_diameter      = \n| capacity            = \n| num_track           = \n| track_gauge         = \n| structure_gauge     = \n| electrification     = \n| architect           = [[Percy Allan]]\n| designer            = \n| contracted_designer = \n| winner              = \n| engineering         = [[Ernest de Burgh]]\n| builder             = S.

There are seven timber approach spans at one end and three at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|178.6|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nThe bridge is {{convert|14.3|m|ft|0}} above the high water line and the centre lift span previously rose another {{convert|7.9|m|ft|0}}. The lifting span was fixed in position in 1940 as the need for river steamers ceased.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nThe internal lift span is supported by twin cast iron cylinders. The timber truss spans are supported by timber trestles. The superstructure provides a carriageway with a minimum width of 5.1m. Guard rails are of post and rail construction over the approach and timber truss spans.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nIt was reported to be in good condition and to be intact as at 13 September 2005.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nCompleted in 1901, Hinton Bridge is an Allan timber truss road bridge, and has a lift span which in the past accommodated river steamers that travelled the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] system. Hinton is one of only three lift bridges in the Hunter region. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Hinton bridge is in the [[Hunter Region]], which has 15 historic road bridges each constructed before 1905. It gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. Hinton bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\nHinton Bridge over Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe bridge is highly valued by the nearby Hinton community. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is highly rare because of its lift span and age.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is representative of Allan timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1470/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019478}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|work=Roads and Traffic Authority|date=2007|title=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301090}}\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Hinton Bridge over Paterson River|dno=5051372|id=01470|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Paterson River bridge, Hinton}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n{{Hunter Region places and items of interest}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1901]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Allan truss bridges]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:City of Maitland]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "expand infobox bridge and general clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_River_bridge,_Hinton"}

According to Jethva and others, the post-monsoon custom is to prepare the crop fields by deliberately burning the residual stubble between October and November.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /><ref name=\"Singh2017\"/> As crop productivity per hectare has increased with mechanised harvesting, this has led to the practice becoming more widespread in the northern and northwestern regions of India in the months when Diwali is observed.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /> The smoke from the burning of the fields is carried by seasonal winds over the floodplain, where it is inverted by the colder winds and spread throughout the region for much of the winter. Other contributors to the poor air quality include daily vehicular and industrial activity along with the burning of other biomass.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\">{{cite journal | last=Jethva | first=Hiren | last2=Chand | first2=Duli | last3=Torres | title=Agricultural Burning and Air Quality over Northern India: A Synergistic Analysis using NASA's A-train Satellite Data and Ground Measurements | journal=Aerosol and Air Quality Research | volume=18 | issue=7 | year=2018 | doi=10.4209/aaqr.2017.12.0583 | pages=1756\u20131773}}</ref><ref name=\"Singh2017\">{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Jabrinder | last2=Singhal | first2=Naveen | last3=Singhal | first3=Shailey | last4=Sharma | title=Advances in Health and Environment Safety | chapter=Environmental Implications of Rice and Wheat Stubble Burning in North-Western States of India | publisher=Springer | year=2017 | isbn=978-981-10-7121-8 | doi=10.1007/978-981-10-7122-5_6 | pages=47\u201355}}</ref>\n\nA study of residential areas of Delhi in 2006-08, found that concentration of [[particulate matter]] as well as [[sulphur dioxide]] increased on the day of Diwali relative to other days of the month and that the increase could be exacerbated by prevailing meteorological conditions; there was also a correlated increase in [[noise pollution|ambient noise levels]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Papiya | first1 = M. | last2 = Mamta | first2 = P.  |title=Impact of Diwali celebrations on urban air and noise quality in Delhi City, India |journal=Environmental Monitoring & Assessment |volume=184 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013215 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10661-011-1960-7}}</ref> Another study of air pollution in Delhi found that the PM{{sub|2.5}} levels in 2015 and 2016 did rise over Diwali, but these higher levels were \"a result of contribution from fireworks on the Diwali night, trans-regional movement of pollutants due to crop residue burning, low wind speed, and high humidity\".

A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C.

In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions.

Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\nThe [[medieval]] standard was usually about eight feet long, but [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[herald]]s determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent \u2013 not to be borne in battle\" \u2013 was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies: ''The Art of Heraldry'' (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Livery colours===\nThe term [[livery]] is derived from the French ''livr\u00e9e'' from the [[Latin]] ''liberare'', meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions. It appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the [[Coat of arms of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |title=Coats of arms |publisher=royal.gov.uk |accessdate=25 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308050901/https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Standards of England==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%\" |Portrait\n! style=\"width:10%\" |Bearer \n! style=\"width:40%\" |Standard\n! style=\"width:40%\" |Notes\n|-\n![[File:King Edward III from NPG.jpg|80px]]\n![[Edward III of England|Edward III]]\n![[File:Royal Standard of Edward III of England.svg|500px]]\n| The [[St George's Cross]] in the hoist.
