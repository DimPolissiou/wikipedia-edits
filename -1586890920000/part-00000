This ratio determines the ''standard parallel'' of the projection, which is the parallel at which there is no distortion and along which distances match the stated scale.

That constant is {{radic|2}}.\n\nThe name \"Gall\u2013Peters projection\" seems to have been used first by [[Arthur H. Robinson]] in a pamphlet put out by the American Cartographic Association in 1986.<ref name=\"ACA1986\">American Cartographic Association's Committee on Map Projections, 1986. ''Which Map is Best'' p. 12. Falls Church: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping.</ref> Before 1973 it had been known, when referred to at all, as the \"Gall orthographic\" or \"Gall's orthographic.\" Most Peters supporters refer to it only as the \"Peters projection.\" During the years of [[#Controversy|controversy]] the cartographic literature tended to mention both attributions, settling on one or the other for the purposes of the article. In recent years \"Gall\u2013Peters\" seems to dominate.\n\n==Peters world map==\n[[File:Peters projection, date line in Bering strait.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The right and left borders of the Peters map are in the [[Bering Strait]], so all of Russia is displayed on the right side. \n{{legend|#00b400|Greenwich great circle}}\n{{legend|#c80000|Bering Strait great circle (traversing [[Florence]] in Italy, see [[Florence meridian]])}}]]\n{{Tissot_indicatrix_world_map_cyl_equal-area_proj_comparison.svg}}\nIn 1967, [[Arno Peters]], a German filmmaker, devised a map projection identical to Gall's orthographic projection and presented it in 1973 as a \"new invention\". He promoted it as a superior alternative to the [[Mercator projection]], which was suited to navigation but also used commonly in world maps. The Mercator projection increasingly inflates the sizes of regions according to their distance from the equator. This inflation results, for example, in a representation of [[Greenland]] that is larger than [[Africa]], which has a geographic area 14 times greater than Greenland's. Since much of the technologically underdeveloped world lies near the equator, these countries appear smaller on a Mercator and therefore, according to Peters, seem less significant.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/>{{rp|155}} On Peters's projection, by contrast, areas of equal size on the globe are also equally sized on the map.

The preceding century had already witnessed many campaigns for new projections with little visible result. Just twenty years earlier, for example, Trystan Edwards described and promoted his own eponymous projection, disparaging the Mercator, and recommending his projection as ''the'' solution.<ref name=\"Edwards\">Edwards, Trystan (1953). ''A New Map of the World''. London: B.T. Batsford LTD.</ref> Peters's projection differed from Edwards's only in height-to-width ratio. More problematic, Peters's projection was identical to one that was already over a century old, though he probably did not realize it.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/> That projection\u2014Gall's orthographic\u2014passed unnoticed when it was announced in 1855.\n\nBeyond the lack of novelty in the projection itself, the claims Peters made about the projection were also familiar to cartographers. Just as in the case of Peters, earlier projections generally were promoted as alternatives to the Mercator. Inappropriate use of the Mercator projection in world maps and the size disparities figuring prominently in Peters's arguments against the Mercator projection had been remarked upon for centuries and quite commonly in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Edwards\"/><ref name=\"Hinks\">Hinks, Arthur R.

He announced his map at a time when themes of social justice resonated strongly in academia and politics. Suggesting \"[[cartographic imperialism]]\", Peters found ready audiences. The campaign was bolstered by the claim that the Peters projection was the only \"area-correct\" map. Other claims included \"absolute angle conformality\", \"no extreme distortions of form\", and \"totally distance-factual\".<ref name=\"Bulletin\">(1977) ''The Bulletin'' 25 (17) pp. 126\u2013127.

In the ensuing years, however, it became clear that Peters and his map were no flash in the pan. By 1980 many cartographers had turned overtly hostile to his claims. In particular, Peters writes in ''The New Cartography'',\n\n{{quote|Philosophers, astronomers, historians, popes and mathematicians have all drawn global maps long before cartographers as such existed. Cartographers appeared in the \"Age of Discovery\", which developed into the Age of European Conquest and Exploitation and took over the task of making maps.\n\nBy the authority of their profession they have hindered its development. Since Mercator produced his global map over four hundred years ago for the age of Europeans world domination, cartographers have clung to it despite its having been long outdated by events. They have sought to render it topical by cosmetic corrections.\n\n... The European world concept, as the last expression of a subjective global view of primitive peoples, must give way to an objective global concept.\n\nThe cartographic profession is, by its retention of old precepts based on the Eurocentric global concept, incapable of developing this egalitarian world map which alone can demonstrate the parity of all peoples of the earth.<ref name=\"Peters\">Peters, Arno (1983). ''Die Neue Kartographie/The New Cartography'' (in German and English). Klagenfurt, Austria: Carinthia University; New York: Friendship Press.</ref>}}\n\nThis attack galled the cartographic community. Their most emphatic refutation of Peters's assertions was the long list of cartographers who, over the preceding century, had formally expressed frustration at publishers' overuse of the Mercator, as noted above.<ref name=\"Snyder157\"/> Many of those cartographers had already developed projections they explicitly promoted as alternatives to the Mercator, including the most influential American cartographers of the twentieth century: [[John Paul Goode]] ([[Goode homolosine projection]]), [[Erwin Raisz]] ([[Armadillo projection]]), and [[Arthur H. Robinson]] ([[Robinson projection]]). Hence the cartographic community viewed Peters's narrative as ahistorical and mean-spirited.\n\nThe two camps never made any real attempts toward reconciliation. The Peters camp largely ignored the protests of the cartographers. Peters maintained there should be \"one map for one world\"<ref name=\"ODT\">''Arno Peters: Radical Map, Remarkable Man''.

The 1980s saw a flurry of literature directed against the Peters phenomenon. Though Peters's map was not singled out, the controversy motivated the American Cartographic Association (now [[Cartography and Geographic Information Society]]) to produce a series of booklets (including ''Which Map Is Best''<ref name=\"ACA1986\"/>) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps.

He promoted it as a superior alternative to the [[Mercator projection]], which was suited to navigation but also used commonly in world maps. The Mercator projection increasingly inflates the sizes of regions according to their distance from the equator. This inflation results, for example, in a representation of [[Greenland]] that is larger than [[Africa]], which has a geographic area 14 times greater than Greenland's. Since much of the technologically underdeveloped world lies near the equator, these countries appear smaller on a Mercator and therefore, according to Peters, seem less significant.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/>{{rp|155}} On Peters's projection, by contrast, areas of equal size on the globe are also equally sized on the map. By using his \"new\" projection, Peters argued that poorer, less powerful nations could be restored to their rightful proportions.

The preceding century had already witnessed many campaigns for new projections with little visible result. Just twenty years earlier, for example, Trystan Edwards described and promoted his own eponymous projection, disparaging the Mercator, and recommending his projection as ''the'' solution.<ref name=\"Edwards\">Edwards, Trystan (1953). ''A New Map of the World''. London: B.T. Batsford LTD.</ref> Peters's projection differed from Edwards's only in height-to-width ratio. More problematic, Peters's projection was identical to one that was already over a century old, though he probably did not realize it.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/> That projection\u2014Gall's orthographic\u2014passed unnoticed when it was announced in 1855.\n\nBeyond the lack of novelty in the projection itself, the claims Peters made about the projection were also familiar to cartographers. Just as in the case of Peters, earlier projections generally were promoted as alternatives to the Mercator. Inappropriate use of the Mercator projection in world maps and the size disparities figuring prominently in Peters's arguments against the Mercator projection had been remarked upon for centuries and quite commonly in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Edwards\"/><ref name=\"Hinks\">Hinks, Arthur R.

He announced his map at a time when themes of social justice resonated strongly in academia and politics. Suggesting \"[[cartographic imperialism]]\", Peters found ready audiences. The campaign was bolstered by the claim that the Peters projection was the only \"area-correct\" map. Other claims included \"absolute angle conformality\", \"no extreme distortions of form\", and \"totally distance-factual\".<ref name=\"Bulletin\">(1977) ''The Bulletin'' 25 (17) pp. 126\u2013127.

In the ensuing years, however, it became clear that Peters and his map were no flash in the pan. By 1980 many cartographers had turned overtly hostile to his claims. In particular, Peters writes in ''The New Cartography'',\n\n{{quote|Philosophers, astronomers, historians, popes and mathematicians have all drawn global maps long before cartographers as such existed. Cartographers appeared in the \"Age of Discovery\", which developed into the Age of European Conquest and Exploitation and took over the task of making maps.\n\nBy the authority of their profession they have hindered its development. Since Mercator produced his global map over four hundred years ago for the age of Europeans world domination, cartographers have clung to it despite its having been long outdated by events. They have sought to render it topical by cosmetic corrections.\n\n... The European world concept, as the last expression of a subjective global view of primitive peoples, must give way to an objective global concept.\n\nThe cartographic profession is, by its retention of old precepts based on the Eurocentric global concept, incapable of developing this egalitarian world map which alone can demonstrate the parity of all peoples of the earth.<ref name=\"Peters\">Peters, Arno (1983). ''Die Neue Kartographie/The New Cartography'' (in German and English). Klagenfurt, Austria: Carinthia University; New York: Friendship Press.</ref>}}\n\nThis attack galled the cartographic community. Their most emphatic refutation of Peters's assertions was the long list of cartographers who, over the preceding century, had formally expressed frustration at publishers' overuse of the Mercator, as noted above.<ref name=\"Snyder157\"/> Many of those cartographers had already developed projections they explicitly promoted as alternatives to the Mercator, including the most influential American cartographers of the twentieth century: [[John Paul Goode]] ([[Goode homolosine projection]]), [[Erwin Raisz]] ([[Armadillo projection]]), and [[Arthur H. Robinson]] ([[Robinson projection]]). Hence the cartographic community viewed Peters's narrative as ahistorical and mean-spirited.\n\nThe two camps never made any real attempts toward reconciliation. The Peters camp largely ignored the protests of the cartographers. Peters maintained there should be \"one map for one world\"<ref name=\"ODT\">''Arno Peters: Radical Map, Remarkable Man''.

The 1980s saw a flurry of literature directed against the Peters phenomenon. Though Peters's map was not singled out, the controversy motivated the American Cartographic Association (now [[Cartography and Geographic Information Society]]) to produce a series of booklets (including ''Which Map Is Best''<ref name=\"ACA1986\"/>) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps. In 1989 and 1990, after some internal debate, seven North American geographic organizations adopted the following resolution,<ref name=\"Robinson1990\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0033-0124.1990.00101.x | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Arthur | year = 1990 | title = Rectangular World Maps\u2014No! | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 101\u2013104 }}</ref><ref name=\"AmericanCartographer\">''American Cartographer''. 1989. 16(3): 222\u2013223.</ref> which rejected all rectangular world maps, a category that includes both the Mercator and the Gall\u2013Peters projections:\n\n{{quote|WHEREAS, the earth is round with a coordinate system composed entirely of circles, and\n\nWHEREAS, flat world maps are more useful than globe maps, but flattening the globe surface necessarily greatly changes the appearance of Earth's features and coordinate systems, and\n\nWHEREAS, world maps have a powerful and lasting effect on people's impressions of the shapes and sizes of lands and seas, their arrangement, and the nature of the coordinate system, and\n\nWHEREAS, frequently seeing a greatly distorted map tends to make it \"look right\",\n\nTHEREFORE, we strongly urge book and map publishers, the media and government agencies to cease using rectangular world maps for general purposes or artistic displays.

It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become [[product brand]]s.\n\nWhereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves. Celebrities are found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The \"culture\" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The \"culture\" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P.

The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of [[television programs]] where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity-related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding.\n\n\"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics,\" wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, ''The Wish For Kings''. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between \"regular\" men and women, and those on a pedestal.\n\nThe famous religious books of the world's [[faith]]s are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the [[pharaohs]] of ancient [[Egypt]] set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come.\n\nCelebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the [[scilebrities]]). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. [[Mass media]] has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more [[social capital]] than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to [[globalization]] (see [[J-pop]] or [[K-pop]]).\n\n== Perpetuation of celebrity culture ==\nAccording to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity\u2019s social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the [[mass media]].<ref>Driessens, Olivier. \u201cThe Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.\u201d International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641\u2013657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140.

Another example of this was  [[Katy Perry]] campaigning and performing for [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential election]].\n\n=== Celebrities and political issues ===\nCelebrities have used their actions to highlight political issues. Jane Fonda has tried to promote awareness of climate change through being arrested for civil disobedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jane-fondas-climate-change-star-power|title=The Star Power of Jane Fonda's Climate-Change Arrests|last=Demick|first=Barbara|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> With the rise of social media, celebrities have been able to express their opinions on controversial topics to get immediate feedback from their fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/think-celebrities-get-punished-being-political-fact-they-get-retweeted/|title=Analysis {{!}} Think celebrities get punished for being political?

Celebrities are often displeased by their status. [[Paparazzi]] are a problem for celebrities. Another problem is [[celebrity marriage]]. There is research{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an \"A-list\" or \"B-list\" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. [[Bart Spring in 't Veld]], who came to loathe the [[reality TV]] celebrity culture which ''[[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|Big Brother]]'', of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated.\n\n===Celebrity gossip===\nCelebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P. David}}</ref> Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Vehicles===\nIn the USA, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'', and ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of \"micro-celebrities\" through the [[WWW]] ([[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]]).\n\n==Social media==\nCelebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Celebrity Culture and Public Connection|journal = International Journal of Cultural Studies|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 403\u2013421|last=Couldry|first=Nick|doi=10.1177/1367877907083077|year = 2007|url = http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/4813/1/4813.pdf}}</ref>\n \n===Twitter===\n[[Twitter]] allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture. Twitter users could now directly interact with celebrities with the expectation of a public response.\n\n===Instagram===\nThrough [[Instagram]]'s unique format another layer of celebrity culture was added, allowing celebrities to further their intimacy with followers by sharing selected photos and videos with their audience. With each additional platform a celebrity uses to promote themselves, a wider view is created thus enhancing the perception of culture. Instagram also recently changed the layout to try to help celebrities become more noticed.They use an algorithm that determines what pictures are at the top of a person's feed and what pictures are at the bottom and are harder to find.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/421169/most-followers-instagram/|title=Statista Instagram Facts}}</ref> Trends of celebrities found on Instagram have a massive cultural impact as the platform allows for people to see and imitate a celebrities via clothing, speech, or humor allowing them to indirectly engage with celebrity culture.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/> Today, Instagram can be used as a platform for marketing as celebrities can be paid huge sums of money for product placement or usage in their posts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Framing celebrity : new directions in celebrity culture|last1=Homes, Redmond|first1=Su, Sean|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415377102|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369 369]|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30032850|url=https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369}}</ref>\n\n===YouTube===\nRecently, [[YouTube]] has also become a large part of the growth of social media. On this site, there are YouTube influencers that have become to be a new group of celebrities. These influencers may post videos about their daily life in vlogs, beauty, playing videogames, and many other genres. They have become so popular in recent years because viewers see them as more relatable than movie stars or other groups of celebrities. Since they are exposed to very personal videos, fans are able to from a strong bond with these influencers.\n\n==Tantrums==\nSome celebrities are known for \"throwing tantrums\" to get their way. They are also known for getting in debates with their friends, who are also celebrities, in order to amp up the drama and let their names be seen. When an individual is in the public eye, it changes how they act and their behavior. Usually it encourages people to act in extremes, whether that be extremely good or extremely bad. Most of the time, publicity only goes to celebrities who are going against the social norm, and doing something different. People are more interested in reading about something crazy a celebrity did, rather than them going out and having a respectful lunch.\n\n==Complaints==\nA common complaint of modern celebrity culture is that the public, instead of seeking virtues or talents in celebrities, seek those who are the most willing to break ethical boundaries, or those who are most aggressive in self-promotion. In other words, [[infamy]] has replaced fame. The social role of the [[town drunk]], the [[court jester]], or the sexually indiscreet are not new, but arguably, the glorification of these individuals is. Society selects celebrities that provide the most entertainment and news stories as the most notorious.\n\n===Explanations===\nOne possible explanation of this trend is that an artificial importance has been created in order to promote a product or a service, rather than to record a purely biographical event. As more new products are launched in a world market that is constantly expanding, the need for more celebrities has become an [[industry]] in itself.\n\nAnother explanation, used by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], is that this exaggeration of modern celebrity culture is created out of a need for drama and spectacle. In the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'', he describes the pattern of creating a celebrity as a god-like figure, and once this image is created, the desire to destroy it and shame the individual in the most extreme ways possible. [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] magazines are the prototype example of this theory.\n\n==Posthumous fame==\nSome creators such as poets, artists, musicians, and inventors are little-known and little-appreciated during their lives but are feted as brilliant innovators after their deaths. In some cases, after historians uncover a creator's role in the development of some type of cultural or technical process, the contributions of these little-known individuals become more widely known. A desire to achieve this type of posthumous fame may have motivated [[Alan Abel]], [[Adam Rich]] and [[Pauly Shore Is Dead|Pauly Shore]] to stage their own deaths.\n\nSometimes a false death mention can cause a person to rethink their legacy. [[Alfred Nobel]] founded the [[Nobel Prize]]s after an erroneous obituary labelled him a \"merchant of death\" due to his invention and selling of [[dynamite]].\n\nPeople who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]; scientist [[Galileo Galilei]]; 1800s-era poet [[John Keats]]; painter [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]; poet and novelist [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; singer [[Eva Cassidy]]; comedian [[Bill Hicks]]; writer [[Emily Dickinson]]; artist [[Edith Holden]], whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer [[Franz Kafka]]; singer [[Jeff Buckley]]; diarist [[Anne Frank]]; philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]; writer [[John Kennedy Toole]] (who posthumously won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] 12 years after his death); author [[Stieg Larsson]] (who died with his ''[[Millennium series|Millennium]]'' novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet [[Rozz Williams]]; and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged inventor of [[Rugby football]].\n\n[[Herostratus]], a young Greek man [[arson]]ed the [[Temple of Artemis]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the [[death penalty]] for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Celebrity]]\n*[[Superstar]]\n*[[Popularity]]\n*[[Fifteen minutes of fame]]\n*[[Hollywood marriage]]s\n*[[Scientific celebrity]]\n*[[Starsuckers]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author=Gamson, Joshua|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWNLM_1u-r8C|title=Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1999|isbn= 9780520914155}}\n*Schickel, Richard.

It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become [[product brand]]s.\n\nWhereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves. Celebrities are found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The \"culture\" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The \"culture\" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P.

The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of [[television programs]] where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity-related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding.\n\n\"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics,\" wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, ''The Wish For Kings''. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between \"regular\" men and women, and those on a pedestal.\n\nThe famous religious books of the world's [[faith]]s are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the [[pharaohs]] of ancient [[Egypt]] set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come.\n\nCelebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the [[scilebrities]]). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. [[Mass media]] has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more [[social capital]] than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to [[globalization]] (see [[J-pop]] or [[K-pop]]).\n\n== Perpetuation of celebrity culture ==\nAccording to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity\u2019s social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the [[mass media]].<ref>Driessens, Olivier. \u201cThe Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.\u201d International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641\u2013657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140.

The first way is celebrity politicians, which crosses an elected office of government with celebritization. The second way is with political activism, a newly popular method which avoids directly participating in government itself.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=John|date=2004-2011|title=Celebrity Politicians: Popular Culture and Political Representation|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=4|pages=435\u2013452|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2004.00149.x|issn=1369-1481}}</ref>\n\n=== Celebrity politicians ===\nCelebrity politicians can be divided into two categories: celebrities that go over to government and hold an elected office and politicians that become celebrities.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[List of actor-politicians|Celebrities that have held a government office]] are not uncommon. Donald Trump is an example of one. A businessman and real estate dealer who has licensed his name to properties and other brands, Trump gained national fame when he starred in the television show ''The Apprentice'' in 2004, and again during the 2012 presidential election by implying that then presidential candidate Barack Obama was not a natural born United States citizen. He then successfully ran for the United States presidency in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Trump|title=Donald Trump {{!}} Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> Ronald Reagan is another example. He was a career actor that appeared in 53 films over two decades. He first became governor of California in 1966, and then became president of the United States in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan|website=The White House|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref>\n\nPoliticians have also become celebrities themselves, either naturally or by copying celebrity traits. The Democratic group \"The Squad\" is an example.

There is research{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an \"A-list\" or \"B-list\" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. [[Bart Spring in 't Veld]], who came to loathe the [[reality TV]] celebrity culture which ''[[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|Big Brother]]'', of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated.\n\n===Celebrity gossip===\nCelebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19392390903519057|title = The promotion and presentation of the self: Celebrity as marker of presentational media| journal=Celebrity Studies| volume=1| pages=35\u201348|year = 2010|last1 = Marshall|first1 = P. David}}</ref> Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Vehicles===\nIn the USA, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'', and ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of \"micro-celebrities\" through the [[WWW]] ([[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]]).\n\n==Social media==\nCelebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Celebrity Culture and Public Connection|journal = International Journal of Cultural Studies|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 403\u2013421|last=Couldry|first=Nick|doi=10.1177/1367877907083077|year = 2007|url = http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/4813/1/4813.pdf}}</ref>\n \n===Twitter===\n[[Twitter]] allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture. Twitter users could now directly interact with celebrities with the expectation of a public response.\n\n===Instagram===\nThrough [[Instagram]]'s unique format another layer of celebrity culture was added, allowing celebrities to further their intimacy with followers by sharing selected photos and videos with their audience. With each additional platform a celebrity uses to promote themselves, a wider view is created thus enhancing the perception of culture. Instagram also recently changed the layout to try to help celebrities become more noticed.They use an algorithm that determines what pictures are at the top of a person's feed and what pictures are at the bottom and are harder to find.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/421169/most-followers-instagram/|title=Statista Instagram Facts}}</ref> Trends of celebrities found on Instagram have a massive cultural impact as the platform allows for people to see and imitate a celebrities via clothing, speech, or humor allowing them to indirectly engage with celebrity culture.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/> Today, Instagram can be used as a platform for marketing as celebrities can be paid huge sums of money for product placement or usage in their posts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Framing celebrity : new directions in celebrity culture|last1=Homes, Redmond|first1=Su, Sean|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415377102|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369 369]|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30032850|url=https://archive.org/details/framingcelebrity0000unse/page/369}}</ref>\n\n===YouTube===\nRecently, [[YouTube]] has also become a large part of the growth of social media. On this site, there are YouTube influencers that have become to be a new group of celebrities. These influencers may post videos about their daily life in vlogs, beauty, playing videogames, and many other genres. They have become so popular in recent years because viewers see them as more relatable than movie stars or other groups of celebrities. Since they are exposed to very personal videos, fans are able to from a strong bond with these influencers.\n\n==Tantrums==\nSome celebrities are known for \"throwing tantrums\" to get their way. They are also known for getting in debates with their friends, who are also celebrities, in order to amp up the drama and let their names be seen. When an individual is in the public eye, it changes how they act and their behavior. Usually it encourages people to act in extremes, whether that be extremely good or extremely bad. Most of the time, publicity only goes to celebrities who are going against the social norm, and doing something different. People are more interested in reading about something crazy a celebrity did, rather than them going out and having a respectful lunch.\n\n==Complaints==\nA common complaint of modern celebrity culture is that the public, instead of seeking virtues or talents in celebrities, seek those who are the most willing to break ethical boundaries, or those who are most aggressive in self-promotion. In other words, [[infamy]] has replaced fame. The social role of the [[town drunk]], the [[court jester]], or the sexually indiscreet are not new, but arguably, the glorification of these individuals is. Society selects celebrities that provide the most entertainment and news stories as the most notorious.\n\n===Explanations===\nOne possible explanation of this trend is that an artificial importance has been created in order to promote a product or a service, rather than to record a purely biographical event. As more new products are launched in a world market that is constantly expanding, the need for more celebrities has become an [[industry]] in itself.\n\nAnother explanation, used by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], is that this exaggeration of modern celebrity culture is created out of a need for drama and spectacle. In the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'', he describes the pattern of creating a celebrity as a god-like figure, and once this image is created, the desire to destroy it and shame the individual in the most extreme ways possible. [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] magazines are the prototype example of this theory.\n\npeople\n\n==Posthumous fame==\nSome creators such as poets, artists, musicians, and inventors are little-known and little-appreciated during their lives but are feted as brilliant innovators after their deaths. In some cases, after historians uncover a creator's role in the development of some type of cultural or technical process, the contributions of these little-known individuals become more widely known. A desire to achieve this type of posthumous fame may have motivated [[Alan Abel]], [[Adam Rich]] and [[Pauly Shore Is Dead|Pauly Shore]] to stage their own deaths.\n\nSometimes a false death mention can cause a person to rethink their legacy. [[Alfred Nobel]] founded the [[Nobel Prize]]s after an erroneous obituary labelled him a \"merchant of death\" due to his invention and selling of [[dynamite]].\n\nPeople who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]; scientist [[Galileo Galilei]]; 1800s-era poet [[John Keats]]; painter [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]; poet and novelist [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; singer [[Eva Cassidy]]; comedian [[Bill Hicks]]; writer [[Emily Dickinson]]; artist [[Edith Holden]], whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer [[Franz Kafka]]; singer [[Jeff Buckley]]; diarist [[Anne Frank]]; philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]; writer [[John Kennedy Toole]] (who posthumously won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] 12 years after his death); author [[Stieg Larsson]] (who died with his ''[[Millennium series|Millennium]]'' novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet [[Rozz Williams]]; and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged inventor of [[Rugby football]].\n\n[[Herostratus]], a young Greek man [[arson]]ed the [[Temple of Artemis]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the [[death penalty]] for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Celebrity]]\n*[[Superstar]]\n*[[Popularity]]\n*[[Fifteen minutes of fame]]\n*[[Hollywood marriage]]s\n*[[Scientific celebrity]]\n*[[Starsuckers]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author=Gamson, Joshua|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWNLM_1u-r8C|title=Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1999|isbn= 9780520914155}}\n*Schickel, Richard.

'''Nonclassical molecules''' (MHC class IB) exhibit limited polymorphism, expression patterns, and presented antigens; this group is subdivided into a group encoded within MHC loci (e.g., HLA-E, -F, -G), as well as those not (e.g., [[induced-self antigen|stress ligands]] such as ULBPs, Rae1, and H60); the antigen/ligand for many of these molecules remain unknown, but they can interact with each of CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells.\n\n=== MHC Class II  ===\n{{Main|MHC class II}}\n\n[[MHC class II]] can be conditionally expressed by all cell types, but normally occurs only on \"professional\" [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs): [[macrophage]]s, [[B cell]]s, and especially [[dendritic cells]] (DCs). An APC takes up an [[antigenic]] protein, performs [[antigen processing]], and returns a molecular fraction of it\u2014a fraction termed the [[epitope]]\u2014and displays it on the APC's surface coupled within an MHC class II molecule ([[antigen presentation]]). On the cell's surface, the epitope can be recognized by immunologic structures like T cell receptors (TCRs). The molecular region which binds to the epitope is the [[paratope]].\n\nOn surfaces of helper T cells are CD4 receptors, as well as TCRs. When a naive helper T cell's CD4 molecule docks to an APC's MHC class II molecule, its TCR can meet and bind the epitope coupled within the MHC class II. This event primes the naive T cell.

Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the [[complement system]] (such as C2, C4, and B factor), cytokines (such as [[TNF-alpha|TNF-\u03b1]], LTA, and LTB), and [[heat shock protein]]s.\n\n=== Function ===\nMHC is the tissue-antigen that allows the immune system (more specifically T cells) to bind to, recognize, and tolerate itself (autorecognition). MHC is also the chaperone for intracellular peptides that are complexed with MHCs and presented to [[T cell receptor]]s (TCRs) as potential foreign antigens. MHC interacts with TCR and its co-receptors to optimize binding conditions for the TCR-antigen interaction, in terms of antigen binding affinity and specificity, and signal transduction effectiveness.\n\nEssentially, the MHC-peptide complex is a complex of auto-antigen/allo-antigen. Upon binding, T cells should in principle tolerate the auto-antigen, but activate when exposed to the allo-antigen. Disease states occur when this principle is disrupted.\n\n[[Antigen presentation]]: MHC molecules bind to both [[T cell receptor]] and [[CD4]]/[[CD8]] co-receptors on [[T lymphocytes]], and the antigen [[epitope]] held in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule interacts with the [[Immunoglobulin superfamily|variable Ig-Like domain]] of the TCR to trigger T-cell activation<ref name=\"KindtGoldsby20072\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas J.

[[HLA-B27]] is an example. It is unclear how exactly having the HLA-B27 tissue type increases the risk of [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and other associated inflammatory diseases, but mechanisms involving aberrant antigen presentation or T cell activation have been hypothesized.\n\nTissue [[allorecognition]]: MHC molecules in complex with peptide epitopes are essentially ligands for TCRs. T cells become activated by binding to the peptide-binding grooves of any MHC molecule that they were not trained to recognize during [[MHC restriction|positive selection]] in the [[thymus]].\n\n== Antigen processing and presentation ==\n[[File:MHC Class I processing.svg|left|350px|thumb|'''MHC class I pathway''': Proteins in the [[cytosol]] are degraded by the [[proteasome]], liberating peptides internalized by [[transporter associated with antigen processing|TAP]] channel in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], there associating with MHC-I molecules freshly synthesized.

Following selection, each T lymphocyte shows dual specificity: The TCR recognizes self MHC, but only non-self antigens.\n\nMHC restriction occurs during lymphocyte development in the thymus through a process known as [[positive selection]]. T cells that do not receive a positive survival signal \u2014 mediated mainly by thymic epithelial cells presenting self peptides bound to MHC molecules \u2014 to their TCR undergo apoptosis. Positive selection ensures that mature T cells can functionally recognize MHC molecules in the periphery (i.e. elsewhere in the body).\n\nThe TCRs of T lymphocytes recognise only [[sequential epitope]]s, also called [[linear epitope]]s, of only peptides and only if coupled within an MHC molecule. (Antibody molecules secreted by [[plasma cell|activated B cells]], though, recognize diverse epitopes\u2014[[peptide]], [[lipid]], [[carbohydrate]], and [[nucleic acid]]\u2014and recognize [[conformational epitope]]s, which have [[three-dimensional]] structure.)\n\n==In sexual mate selection==\n{{main|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection}}\n{{See also|Interpersonal compatibility}}\nMHC molecules enable immune system surveillance of the population of protein molecules in a host cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of [[antigen presentation]].

The T lymphocytes' recognition of the foreign MHC as self is [[allorecognition]].{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}\n\nTransplant rejection has various types known to be mediated by MHC (HLA):\n* '''Hyperacute rejection''' occurs when, before the transplantation, the recipient has preformed anti-HLA antibodies, perhaps by previous blood transfusions (donor tissue that includes lymphocytes expressing HLA molecules), by anti-HLA generated during pregnancy (directed at the father's HLA displayed by the fetus), or by previous transplantation;\n* '''Acute cellular rejection''' occurs when the recipient's T lymphocytes are activated by the donor tissue, causing damage via mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity from CD8 cells.\n* '''Acute humoral rejection and chronic disfunction''' occurs when the recipient's anti-HLA antibodies form directed at HLA molecules present on [[endothelial cells]] of the transplanted tissue.\n\nIn all of the above situations, immunity is directed at the transplanted organ, sustaining lesions. A cross-reaction test between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed. The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate. Global databases of donor information enhance the search for compatible donors.\n\n==HLA biology==\n[[File:MHC expression.svg|thumb|Right|300px|Codominant expression of HLA genes]]\n{{Main|Human leukocyte antigen}}\nHuman MHC class I and II are also called [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA). To clarify the usage, some of the biomedical literature uses HLA to refer specifically to the HLA protein molecules and reserves MHC for the region of the genome that encodes for this molecule, but this is not a consistent convention.\n\nThe most studied HLA genes are the nine classical MHC genes: ''[[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], [[HLA-C]], [[HLA-DPA1]], [[HLA-DPB1]], [[HLA-DQA1]], [[HLA-DQB1]], [[HLA-DRA]]'', and ''[[HLA-DRB1]]''. In humans, the MHC gene cluster is divided into three regions: classes I, II, and III. The A, B and C genes belong to MHC class I, whereas the six D genes belong to class II.\n\nMHC alleles are expressed in codominant fashion.<ref name=\"ABBAS\">{{cite book | last =Abbas | authorlink = |author2=Lichtman A.H. | editor = | title = Basic Immunology.

That means that one [[heterozygous]] individual can inherit six or eight functioning class-II alleles, three or more from each parent. The role of ''DQA2'' or ''DQB2'' is not verified. The ''DRB2, DRB6, DRB7, DRB8'' and ''DRB9'' are pseudogenes.\n\nThe set of alleles that is present in each chromosome is called the MHC [[haplotype]]. In humans, each HLA allele is named with a number. For instance, for a given individual, his haplotype might be HLA-A2, HLA-B5, HLA-DR3, etc... Each heterozygous individual will have two MHC haplotypes, one each from the paternal and maternal chromosomes.\n\nThe MHC genes are highly polymorphic; many different alleles exist in the different individuals inside a population. The polymorphism is so high, in a mixed population (non[[endogamy|endogamic]]), no two individuals have exactly the same set of MHC molecules, with the exception of [[twin|identical twins]].\n\nThe polymorphic regions in each allele are located in the region for peptide contact. Of all the peptides that could be displayed by MHC, only a subset will bind strongly enough to any given HLA allele, so by carrying two alleles for each gene, a much larger set of peptides can be presented.{{why|date=June 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, inside a population, the presence of many different alleles ensures there will always be an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism ensures that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to win over the pathogen. The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], as it is the case for the antigen [[Immune receptor|receptors]].\n\nBecause of the high levels of [[allele|allelic]] diversity found within its genes, MHC has also attracted the attention of many [[evolution]]ary biologists.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spurgin LG, Richardson DS | title = How pathogens drive genetic diversity: MHC, mechanisms and misunderstandings | journal = Proceedings.

'''Nonclassical molecules''' (MHC class IB) exhibit limited polymorphism, expression patterns, and presented antigens; this group is subdivided into a group encoded within MHC loci (e.g., HLA-E, -F, -G), as well as those not (e.g., [[induced-self antigen|stress ligands]] such as ULBPs, Rae1, and H60); the antigen/ligand for many of these molecules remain unknown, but they can interact with each of CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells.\n\n=== MHC Class II  ===\n{{Main|MHC class II}}\n\n[[MHC class II]] can be conditionally expressed by all cell types, but normally occurs only on \"professional\" [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs): [[macrophage]]s, [[B cell]]s, and especially [[dendritic cells]] (DCs). An APC takes up an [[antigenic]] protein, performs [[antigen processing]], and returns a molecular fraction of it\u2014a fraction termed the [[epitope]]\u2014and displays it on the APC's surface coupled within an MHC class II molecule ([[antigen presentation]]). On the cell's surface, the epitope can be recognized by immunologic structures like T cell receptors (TCRs). The molecular region which binds to the epitope is the [[paratope]].\n\nOn surfaces of helper T cells are CD4 receptors, as well as TCRs. When a naive helper T cell's CD4 molecule docks to an APC's MHC class II molecule, its TCR can meet and bind the epitope coupled within the MHC class II. This event primes the naive T cell. According to the local milieu, that is, the balance of [[cytokine]]s secreted by APCs in the microenvironment, the naive helper T cell (Th<sub>0</sub>) polarizes into either a memory Th cell or an effector Th cell of [[phenotype]] either type 1 (Th<sub>1</sub>), type 2 (Th<sub>2</sub>), type 17 (Th<sub>17</sub>), or regulatory/suppressor (T<sub>reg</sub>), as so far identified, the Th cell's terminal differentiation.\n\nMHC class II thus mediates immunization to\u2014or, if APCs polarize Th<sub>0</sub> cells principally to T<sub>reg</sub> cells, [[immune tolerance]] of\u2014an [[antigen]]. The polarization during primary exposure to an antigen is key in determining a number [[chronic disease]]s, such as [[inflammatory bowel diseases]] and [[asthma]], by skewing the immune response that memory Th cells coordinate when their memory recall is triggered upon secondary exposure to similar antigens. B cells express MHC class II to present antigens to Th<sub>0</sub>, but when their [[B cell receptor]]s bind matching epitopes, interactions which are not mediated by MHC, these [[Plasma cell|activated B cells]] secrete soluble immunoglobulins: [[antibody]] molecules mediating [[humoral immunity]].\n\nClass II MHC molecules are also heterodimers, genes for both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits are polymorphic and located  within MHC class II subregion. Peptide-binding groove of MHC-II molecules is forms by N-terminal domains of both subunits of the heterodimer, \u03b11 and \u03b21, unlike MHC-I molecules, where two domains of the same chain are involved.

Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the [[complement system]] (such as C2, C4, and B factor), cytokines (such as [[TNF-alpha|TNF-\u03b1]], LTA, and LTB), and [[heat shock protein]]s.\n\n=== Function ===\nMHC is the tissue-antigen that allows the immune system (more specifically T cells) to bind to, recognize, and tolerate itself (autorecognition). MHC is also the chaperone for intracellular peptides that are complexed with MHCs and presented to [[T cell receptor]]s (TCRs) as potential foreign antigens. MHC interacts with TCR and its co-receptors to optimize binding conditions for the TCR-antigen interaction, in terms of antigen binding affinity and specificity, and signal transduction effectiveness.\n\nEssentially, the MHC-peptide complex is a complex of auto-antigen/allo-antigen. Upon binding, T cells should in principle tolerate the auto-antigen, but activate when exposed to the allo-antigen. Disease states occur when this principle is disrupted.\n\n[[Antigen presentation]]: MHC molecules bind to both [[T cell receptor]] and [[CD4]]/[[CD8]] co-receptors on [[T lymphocytes]], and the antigen [[epitope]] held in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule interacts with the [[Immunoglobulin superfamily|variable Ig-Like domain]] of the TCR to trigger T-cell activation<ref name=\"KindtGoldsby20072\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas J.

[[HLA-B27]] is an example. It is unclear how exactly having the HLA-B27 tissue type increases the risk of [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and other associated inflammatory diseases, but mechanisms involving aberrant antigen presentation or T cell activation have been hypothesized.\n\nTissue [[allorecognition]]: MHC molecules in complex with peptide epitopes are essentially ligands for TCRs. T cells become activated by binding to the peptide-binding grooves of any MHC molecule that they were not trained to recognize during [[MHC restriction|positive selection]] in the [[thymus]].\n\n== Antigen processing and presentation ==\n[[File:MHC Class I processing.svg|left|350px|thumb|'''MHC class I pathway''': Proteins in the [[cytosol]] are degraded by the [[proteasome]], liberating peptides internalized by [[transporter associated with antigen processing|TAP]] channel in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], there associating with MHC-I molecules freshly synthesized.

Following selection, each T lymphocyte shows dual specificity: The TCR recognizes self MHC, but only non-self antigens.\n\nMHC restriction occurs during lymphocyte development in the thymus through a process known as [[positive selection]]. T cells that do not receive a positive survival signal \u2014 mediated mainly by thymic epithelial cells presenting self peptides bound to MHC molecules \u2014 to their TCR undergo apoptosis. Positive selection ensures that mature T cells can functionally recognize MHC molecules in the periphery (i.e. elsewhere in the body).\n\nThe TCRs of T lymphocytes recognise only [[sequential epitope]]s, also called [[linear epitope]]s, of only peptides and only if coupled within an MHC molecule. (Antibody molecules secreted by [[plasma cell|activated B cells]], though, recognize diverse epitopes\u2014[[peptide]], [[lipid]], [[carbohydrate]], and [[nucleic acid]]\u2014and recognize [[conformational epitope]]s, which have [[three-dimensional]] structure.)\n\n==In sexual mate selection==\n{{main|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection}}\n{{See also|Interpersonal compatibility}}\nMHC molecules enable immune system surveillance of the population of protein molecules in a host cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of [[antigen presentation]].

A cross-reaction test between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed. The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate.

The A, B and C genes belong to MHC class I, whereas the six D genes belong to class II.\n\nMHC alleles are expressed in codominant fashion.<ref name=\"ABBAS\">{{cite book | last =Abbas | authorlink = |author2=Lichtman A.H. | editor = | title = Basic Immunology.

That means that one [[heterozygous]] individual can inherit six or eight functioning class-II alleles, three or more from each parent. The role of ''DQA2'' or ''DQB2'' is not verified. The ''DRB2, DRB6, DRB7, DRB8'' and ''DRB9'' are pseudogenes.\n\nThe set of alleles that is present in each chromosome is called the MHC [[haplotype]]. In humans, each HLA allele is named with a number. For instance, for a given individual, his haplotype might be HLA-A2, HLA-B5, HLA-DR3, etc... Each heterozygous individual will have two MHC haplotypes, one each from the paternal and maternal chromosomes.\n\nThe MHC genes are highly polymorphic; many different alleles exist in the different individuals inside a population. The polymorphism is so high, in a mixed population (non[[endogamy|endogamic]]), no two individuals have exactly the same set of MHC molecules, with the exception of [[twin|identical twins]].\n\nThe polymorphic regions in each allele are located in the region for peptide contact. Of all the peptides that could be displayed by MHC, only a subset will bind strongly enough to any given HLA allele, so by carrying two alleles for each gene, a much larger set of peptides can be presented.{{why|date=June 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, inside a population, the presence of many different alleles ensures there will always be an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism ensures that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to win over the pathogen. The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], as it is the case for the antigen [[Immune receptor|receptors]].\n\nBecause of the high levels of [[allele|allelic]] diversity found within its genes, MHC has also attracted the attention of many [[evolution]]ary biologists.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spurgin LG, Richardson DS | title = How pathogens drive genetic diversity: MHC, mechanisms and misunderstandings | journal = Proceedings.

The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace all remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd.

The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \"Will not stop\" in red). However, the LCD displays on the R179s that show the route are slightly larger than those on the R160s. Additionally, if the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \"Route change: this map is not in use\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \"Listen to train crew for announcement.\"<ref name=\"Metro-NYCS-NTT-Dec2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/210993/new-york-city-bringing-rail-into-the-21st-century|title=New York City Bringing Rail Into the 21st Century|date=December 6, 2006|work=[[Metro Magazine]]|last1=Seaton|first1=Charles|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-CapitalOversight-Jan2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting January 2016|date=January 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071849/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|archivedate=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov20052\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information|last=Chan|first=Sewell|date=November 30, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149990|title=Showing Image 149990|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> In addition, the R179s utilize the older door closing chimes used on the R142s and R142As, as opposed to the newer door chimes used on the R143s, R160s and R188s.

The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace all remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd. This includes an [[LCD]] screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149991</ref> There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \"Will not stop\" in red). However, the LCD displays on the R179s that show the route are slightly larger than those on the R160s. Additionally, if the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \"Route change: this map is not in use\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \"Listen to train crew for announcement.\"<ref name=\"Metro-NYCS-NTT-Dec2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/210993/new-york-city-bringing-rail-into-the-21st-century|title=New York City Bringing Rail Into the 21st Century|date=December 6, 2006|work=[[Metro Magazine]]|last1=Seaton|first1=Charles|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-CapitalOversight-Jan2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting January 2016|date=January 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071849/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|archivedate=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov20052\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information|last=Chan|first=Sewell|date=November 30, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149990|title=Showing Image 149990|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> In addition, the R179s utilize the older door closing chimes used on the R142s and R142As, as opposed to the newer door chimes used on the R143s, R160s and R188s.
