Cycleways and footpaths, notably the Neustadt to Speyer cycleway, characterise the flat [[landscape]], through which the ''H\u00f6rstengraben'' stream flows, north of the village, before emptying into the [[Speyerbach]] near [[Hanhofen]].\n\nIts neighbouring communities are, clockwise from the north, across a short piece (several metres) of the Neustadt village of [[Lachen-Speyerdorf]], [[Ha\u00dfloch]] in the district of [[Landkreis Bad D\u00fcrkheim|Bad D\u00fcrkheim]], [[Hanhofen]] and [[Harthausen]] in the district of [[Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis]], [[Gommersheim]] and [[B\u00f6bingen (Pfalz)|B\u00f6bingen]] in the district of [[S\u00fcdliche Weinstra\u00dfe]] and [[Duttweiler (Neustadt)|Duttweiler]] another sub-district of Neustadt.\n\n== Sights ==\n[[File:Geinsheim 03.jpg|thumb|View of Geinsheim]]\n\n=== Heritage site ===\nThe heart of the village, which is up to 500 years old, is protected as a heritage site.\n\n=== Church buildings ===\nThe protected zone includes the landmark of the municipality, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish church]] of ''[[St. Peter and Paul's Church, Geinsheim|St. Peter und Paul]]'' with its [[Gothic (architecture)|Neogothic]] [[facade]] and its tower that, for some time, has once again been a [[nest]]ing place for the [[white stork]]. It is the largest church in the ''G\u00e4u'' and is therefore known by the locals as the ''G\u00e4u-Dom'' or \"G\u00e4u Cathedral\". The church was built around 1500 and the [[Steeple|tower]] and [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with its [[sacristy]] date to that period.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Geinsheimer-Schulhaus-01.JPG|School and community hall\nFile:Geinsheimer-Dom-04.JPG|Towers of the parish church\nFile:Geinsheimer-Dom-10.JPG|Storks' nest on the church tower\nFile:Geinsheimer-Dom-24.JPG|Interior of the parish church\n </gallery>\n\n=== Secular buildings ===\nThe oldest secular building in the conservation zone, with the address ''G\u00e4ustra\u00dfe 96'', dates to the year 1600 and is built in the [[Renaissance (architecture)|Renaissance]] style. The estate farm in ''G\u00e4ustra\u00dfe 79/81'', with its [[barn]] in which the [[donation]]s to [[Bishopric of Speyer|Speyer's]] [[cathedral chapter]] were stored, dates to the [[Baroque (architecture)|Baroque]] period. The old [[Classicist]] school building, in which the village council is now house, as well as several double and three-sided farmsteads, date to the 18th to 20th centuries and complete the conservation zone.\n\n== Economy and Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nIn addition to some [[German wine|wine]] the main crops are [[asparagus]], [[tobacco]], [[sugar beet]], [[grain]] and [[potatoes]]. Home-grown [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s are often sold by the growers immediately in front of their house on the road or in the farmyards.\n\n=== Transport ===\nGeinsheim is on the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 39|B 39]] federal highway from Neustadt to Speyer. After decades of planning and four years of construction work the 3.4 kilometre long [[ring road]] was opened on 30 August 2005. With the completion of this bypass to the north of the village, the last ring road on this 18-kilometre long stretch of the B&nbsp;39 between Neustadt and Speyer was finished. Over 10,000 vehicles pass Geinsheim daily.\n\nGeinsheim is also connected via the B 39 to the national road network. Six kilometres to the west is the [[Bundesautobahn 65|A 65 motorway]] from [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] to [[Karlsruhe]]; the nearest junction being Neustadt-S\u00fcd. 10&nbsp;kilometres to the east is the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 9|B&nbsp;9]] (Ludwigshafen\u2013[[W\u00f6rth am Rhein]], junction Speyer-Mitte), via which the  [[Bundesautobahn 61|A&nbsp;61]] ([[Koblenz]]\u2013[[Hockenheim]], junction Speyer-Nord), 4 kilometres beyond, can be reached.\n\n=== Clubs ===\nThe ''Chors\u00e4ngern 1791 Geinsheim'' claims to be Germany's oldest [[male voice choir]]. There is a football club, [[SV 1920 Geinsheim]] that once played in the [[Fu\u00dfball-Oberliga S\u00fcdwest|Oberliga-Verein]]. In 1973, an 18-hole golf course was opened by the ''Golf-Club Pfalz'' (\"Palatinate Golf Club\").\n\n=== Festivals ===\nOn the last weekend in August, Geinsheim celebrates the traditional wine festival known as the ''Wein- und Ludwigskerwe''. The 3rd weekend in June is the occasion of the two-day fire service festival run by the Geinsheim Fire Service (''L\u00f6schgruppe Geinsheim'').\n\n=== Population growth ===\nGeinsheim was originally a typical farming and wine-growing village; today it is increasingly a residential suburb of Neustadt.

Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' (''The Spark,'') which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the ''Iskra'' position and began writing for the paper.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1965) pg. 67.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'', pg. 55.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2018}} Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents.

After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Julius Martov]] and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and the \"new guard\" led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov|Martov]]. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\n{{Quote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.<ref>Quoted in chapter XII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm 'My Life'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121230553/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm |date=21 November 2005 }}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\n\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]] (1882 &ndash; 1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (24 February 1906 \u2013 16 February 1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (21 March 1908 \u2013 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\n{{Quote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.<ref>Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129055537/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html |date=29 November 2005 }}</ref>}}\n\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\n\n===Split with Lenin (1903\u20131904)===\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898, ''Iskra'' succeeded in convening the party's [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates.

Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Menshevik|Mensheviks]], argued for a more massive and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks.

In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.<ref name=\"lsrm\" />\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Territory lost under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<ref>The \"Brest-Litovsk\" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; accessed 1 June 2018.</ref>{{Quote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}\n\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories.

Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s, [[Nikolai Krestinsky]]'s and [[Adolph Joffe]]'s) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk.

At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nGermany resumed [[Operation Faustschlag|military operations]] on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7\u20134.

The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight.

Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\n\n=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky Armored Train 1920.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky speaks from the Armoured Train, Russian Civil War in 1920]]\n\nThe failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination.

The notion that the Soviet state could have a capable voluntary or [[militia]] type military was seriously undermined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nTrotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognize the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body.

They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the [[Military Opposition]] (Russian: [[:ru:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f|\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f]]), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918\u20131919.<ref name=\"Life XXXVI\">{{cite book|title=My Life|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|chapter=XXXVI|year=1930|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch36.htm|title-link=My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs \u2013 in place of Podvoisky \u2013 and chairman of the Supreme Military Council.

In May\u2013June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization|mobilisation]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution.

The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters \u2013 come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.}}\n\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Quote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us!

The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the [[Latvian Riflemen]], [[Ioakim Vatsetis|Loakim Vatsetis]] (a.k.a. [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]]), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\n\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled{{by whom|date=February 2014}} from the front.

It was about to cross the [[Ural Mountains]] and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces. But in the south, General [[Anton Denikin]]'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]], ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander [[Sergey Kamenev]] (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members [[Ivar Smilga]], [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front.

Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, V\u0101cietis was suddenly arrested by the [[Cheka]] on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and then supported during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<ref>Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226084149/http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt |date=26 February 2006 }} re: the Smilga episode.

He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned.

Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant \"The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.\"<ref>''Political Report of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) to the Ninth All-Russian Conference of the Communist Party'' delivered by Lenin on 20 September 1920, Document 59 in ''The Unknown Lenin'', ed.

Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\n\n===Trade union debate (1920\u20131921)===\n\nIn late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of [[trade unions in the Soviet Union]]. The discussion split the party into many \"platforms\" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the [[Workers' Opposition]] (headed by [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]) and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] were particularly active.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: <blockquote>\"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\"<ref>[[Tony Cliff]]; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html Trotsky: The Sword of the Revolution 1917-1923] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715195155/https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html |date=15 July 2018 }}; Chapter 11: War Communism at an impasse; paragraph \"The militarisation of all labour\"; Bookmarks, London 1990</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Lenin, Trotsky and Voroshilov with Delegates of the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Klim Voroshilov]] among soldiers in [[Petrograd]] in 1921.]]\n\nLenin sharply criticized Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks.\" His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\n\n[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]\n\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] and [[Leonid Serebryakov]]) supporting Trotsky.\n\nAt a meeting of his faction at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents. At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm \"More on the Suppression of Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref>\n\nYears later, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] and others criticised Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm \"Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073043/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | first=Emma | last=Goldman | title=Trotsky Protests too Much | date=1938 | publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation | location=Glasgow | via=UC Berkeley Library | accessdate=14 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118090914/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | archive-date=18 January 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some Trotskyists, most notably [[Abbie Bakan]], have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion.<ref>[[Abbie Bakan]].

He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919. He was replaced by [[Elena Stasova]], and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.\n\nAfter Krestinsky's ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky's authority, since he was not a full Politburo member.

Stalin's power of patronage{{efn|The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country's ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary's hands.}} in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\n\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).<ref>Document 103 (22 May 1922) in ''The Unknown Lenin''</ref> In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\".

If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????}}\n\nFrom then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in ''[[Lenin's Testament]].'' As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\".<ref>Document 109 in ''The Unknown Lenin''.</ref>\n\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy.<ref>Chapter XXXIX of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch39.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212213/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch39.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref> Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), further centralising state control.

The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIIth Party Congress]].\n\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.<ref>Chapter 11 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051005/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html |date=29 June 2007 }}</ref> Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the ''troika.''{{efn|Trotsky explained in Chapter 12 of his unfinished book [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] that he refused to deliver the report because \"it seemed to me equivalent to announcing my candidacy for the role of Lenin's successor at a time when Lenin was fighting a grave illness.}} Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.<ref>Chapter 12 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712104730/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html |date=12 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a [[standing ovation]].

When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Left opposition (1923\u20131924) ===\n{{main|Left Opposition}} \n[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Trotsky in a 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] \u2013 a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]\n\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"[[Workers' Truth]]\" and \"[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{Quote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization.

[...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.<ref>Leon Trotsky, \"The First Letter to the Central Committee\" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55\u201356.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>}}\n\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\n\n{{Quote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life.

[...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}\n\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''troika'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"<ref>Quoted in Max Shachtman.

Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"{{efn|The term \"Trotskyism\" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the ''troika'' was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's \"mistakes\" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===After Lenin's death (1924)===\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\n\nAt the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<ref>Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430065533/http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm |date=30 April 2006 }}<!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\n{{Quote|None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party.

It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program.\n\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the ''troika'' at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '[[Socialism in One Country]]'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\n\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''<ref>Leon Trotsky \"Lessons of October\" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'', pp. 199\u2013258.</ref> an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\n\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\n\n* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\n* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\n* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\n\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\n\n===A year in the wilderness (1925)===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] of the Soviet Union in May 1925]]\n\n1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts:  chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in ''My Life''<ref name=\":5\">Chapter 22 of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212234/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}</ref> that he \"was taking a rest from politics\" and \"naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\".<ref>Leon Trotsky, ''My Life'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1970) p. 520.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man.<ref>Nikolai Valentinov-Volsky's account of his work with Trotsky in 1925 in ''Novaia Ekonomicheskaia Politika i Krizis Partii Posle Smerti Lenina: Gody Raboty v VSNKh vo Vremia NEP'', Moscow, Sovremennik, 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist [[Max Eastman]] in his book ''Since Lenin Died'' (1925). The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used [[party discipline]] to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIV Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky addresses the meeting in the [[House of the Unions]] in March 1926]]\n\n=== United Opposition (1926\u20131927) ===\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition]].\n\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\n\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the \"History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n{{check quotation}}\nIn reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J.

Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.\n\n<br />\n\n===Defeat and exile (1927\u20131928)===\nIn October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XV Party Congress]], which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]], in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to [[Turkey]] in February 1929, accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and their eldest son, [[Lev Sedov|Lev]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Joshua |title=Leon Trotsky: a revolutionary's life |year=2011 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300137248 |pages=155\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929\u20131941)===\n[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: \"On the service of bourgeoisie\"]]\n\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the [[Soviet Union]], and was exiled to [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist [[Jean Van Heijenoort]], together with his fellow activist [[Pierre Frank]], unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul.<ref name=\"yedlin\">Tova Yedlin, ''Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography'', Praeger/Greenwood, [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], 1992, p.201-202. {{ISBN|978-0-275-96605-8}}</ref> According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.<ref name=\"yedlin\"/> Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" (his letter to ''[[Pravda]]'', titled ''There Should Be No Mercy'', depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German [[Gestapo]]\").<ref>Medvedev, p.169</ref> Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">Feofanov & Barry, p. 22</ref> However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of [[Sergey Kirov]], and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the [[Great Purge]].<ref name=\"faganoppexile\">Fagan, Gus; Biographical Introduction to Christian Rakovsky; chapter ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm Opposition and Exile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715212757/https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm |date=15 July 2018 }}''</ref>\n\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the [[Great Purge]]s of 1936\u20131938, although Rakovsky survived until the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]] of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]].

However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating [[political revolution]], and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.<ref>Erik Van Ree, \"Socialism in One Country: A Reassessment\" ''Studies in East European Thought'' 50#2 (1998) pp 77-117.</ref>\n\n=== Permanent Revolution ===\n{{Main|Permanent revolution}}\n[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural depicts Trotsky with [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] as a true champion of the workers' struggle]]\n\nPermanent Revolution is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:\n\n{{Quote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far \u2013 not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world \u2013 that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: '''The Permanent Revolution'''.}}\n\nTrotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904\u20131905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905''and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"[[Results and Prospects]].\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the [[Third World]] shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editorial Board|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529173202/http://wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|archive-date=29 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===The United Front===\n{{Main|United Front}}\nTrotsky was a central figure in the [[Comintern]] during its first four congresses.

Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' (''The Spark,'') which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the ''Iskra'' position and began writing for the paper.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1965) pg. 67.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'', pg. 55.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2018}} Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents.

After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Julius Martov]] and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and the \"new guard\" led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov|Martov]]. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\n{{Quote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.<ref>Quoted in chapter XII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm 'My Life'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121230553/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm |date=21 November 2005 }}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\n\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]] (1882 &ndash; 1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (24 February 1906 \u2013 16 February 1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (21 March 1908 \u2013 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\n{{Quote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.<ref>Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129055537/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html |date=29 November 2005 }}</ref>}}\n\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\n\n===Split with Lenin (1903\u20131904)===\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898, ''Iskra'' succeeded in convening the party's [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], which had co-founded the [[RSDLP]] in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.<ref name=\":3\">Trotsky, Leon.&nbsp;''My life: an attempt at an autobiography''. Courier Corporation, 2007.</ref>\n\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Menshevik|Mensheviks]], argued for a more massive and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|year=2003|title=The Bolshevik\u2013Menshevik Split|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|journal=History Today|volume=53|number=11|accessdate=22 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175007/http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|archive-date=22 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917, trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of [[permanent revolution]] and developed a close working relationship with [[Alexander Parvus]] in 1904\u201307.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%253Aofi%252Fenc%253AUTF-8&rfr_id=info%253Asid%252Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Parvus%252C+Luxemburg+and+Kautsky+on+the+1905+Russian+Revolution%253A+The+Relationship+with+Trotsky&rft.jtitle=The+Australian+Journal+of+Politics+and+History&rft.au=Weber%252C+Nicholas+S&rft.date=1975-12-01&rft.pub=University+of+Queensland+Press&rft.issn=0004-9522&rft.eissn=1467-8497&rft.volume=21&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=39&paramdict=en-AU|title=Parvus, Luxemburg and Kautsky on the 1905 Russian Revolution: The Relationship with Trotsky|last=Weber|first=Nicholas|date=1975|journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History}}</ref>\n\nDuring their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as a \"[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]\",<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/jan/02.htm Lenin: \"Judas Trotsky's Blush of Shame\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703011452/http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/jan/02.htm |date=3 July 2013 }}, Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved 26 July 2013.</ref> a \"scoundrel\"<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/britain/periodicals/communist_review/1950/01/x01.htm CPGB: Stalin: \"Slander and Truth\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625022442/http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/britain/periodicals/communist_review/1950/01/x01.htm |date=25 June 2013 }}, Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved 26 July 2013.</ref> and a \"swine\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/feb/17ak.htm Lenin: 123.

The attempt was generally unsuccessful.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn [[Vienna]], Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as ''Kievskaya Mysl,'' under a variety of pseudonyms, often using \"Antid Oto.\" In September 1912, ''Kievskaya Mysl''sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two [[Balkan Wars]] for the next year.

Trotsky temporarily joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]], a regional social democratic organization in [[Saint Petersburg]], and became one of its leaders.

Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other socialist parties. By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading.

Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism.

He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<ref>The \"Brest-Litovsk\" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; accessed 1 June 2018.</ref>{{Quote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}\n\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories.

The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight.

They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side.

In May\u2013June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization|mobilisation]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution.

The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters \u2013 come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.}}\n\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Quote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us!

The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the [[Latvian Riflemen]], [[Ioakim Vatsetis|Loakim Vatsetis]] (a.k.a. [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]]), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\n\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled{{by whom|date=February 2014}} from the front. Lenin and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\n\n==== 1919 ====\n[[File:\u041b. \u0414 . \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0435. 1919.jpg|right|thumb|Trotsky at a rally dedicated to the funeral of the victims of the explosion in Leontievsky lane (1919).]]\n[[File:Trotsky con la guardia roja.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Trotsky addressing soldiers of the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War.]]\n[[File:Trotsky on a Polish poster of 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|A Polish poster depicts Trotsky on a pile of skulls and holding a bloody knife, during the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1920]]\n\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIIIth Party Congress]] in March 1919.

It was about to cross the [[Ural Mountains]] and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces. But in the south, General [[Anton Denikin]]'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]], ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander [[Sergey Kamenev]] (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members [[Ivar Smilga]], [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front.

Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, V\u0101cietis was suddenly arrested by the [[Cheka]] on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and then supported during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<ref>Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226084149/http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt |date=26 February 2006 }} re: the Smilga episode.

Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned.

In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his actions in Petrograd.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n====1920====\n[[File:B\u00e9la Kun, Jacques Sadoul, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze, Sergey Gusev 1920.jpg|left|thumb|[[B\u00e9la Kun]], [[Jacques Sadoul (politician)|Jacques Sadoul]], Leon Trotsky, [[Mikhail Frunze]] and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergey Gusev]].

Trotsky spent the winter of 1919\u201320 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of [[War Communism]],<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXVIII)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210202136/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm |date=10 December 2005 }}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref> which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal. He put Trotsky in charge of the country's railroads (while retaining overall control of the Red Army), which he directed should be militarized in the spirit of War Communism. It was not until early 1921, due to economic collapse and social uprisings, that Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership abandoned War Communism in favor of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Kalinin Trotsky Polish\u2013Soviet War.jpg|riht|thumb|[[Mikhail Kalinin]] and Leon Trotsky greet [[Red Army]] troops.

In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued<ref name=\"My Life\" /> that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper.

Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\n\n===Trade union debate (1920\u20131921)===\n\nIn late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of [[trade unions in the Soviet Union]]. The discussion split the party into many \"platforms\" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the [[Workers' Opposition]] (headed by [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]) and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] were particularly active.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: <blockquote>\"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime.

He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\n\n[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]\n\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] and [[Leonid Serebryakov]]) supporting Trotsky.\n\nAt a meeting of his faction at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents.

He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919.

Stalin's power of patronage{{efn|The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones.

New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary's hands.}} in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\n\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).<ref>Document 103 (22 May 1922) in ''The Unknown Lenin''</ref> In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\".

As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom).

Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\n\nIn mid-1923 the ''troika'' had Trotsky's friend and supporter [[Christian Rakovsky]] removed from his post as head of the Ukrainian government ([[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|USSR ''Radnarkom'']]) and sent to London as ambassador. When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Left opposition (1923\u20131924) ===\n{{main|Left Opposition}} \n[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Trotsky in a 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] \u2013 a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]\n\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"[[Workers' Truth]]\" and \"[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{Quote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.<ref>Leon Trotsky, \"The First Letter to the Central Committee\" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55\u201356.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>}}\n\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\n\n{{Quote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}\n\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''troika'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"<ref>Quoted in Max Shachtman.

The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16\u201318 January 1924.

Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"{{efn|The term \"Trotskyism\" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the ''troika'' was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's \"mistakes\" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===After Lenin's death (1924)===\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\n\nAt the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<ref>Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430065533/http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm |date=30 April 2006 }}<!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\n{{Quote|None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party.

It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program.\n\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the ''troika'' at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '[[Socialism in One Country]]'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\n\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''<ref>Leon Trotsky \"Lessons of October\" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'', pp. 199\u2013258.</ref> an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\n\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\n\n* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\n* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\n* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\n\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\n\n===A year in the wilderness (1925)===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] of the Soviet Union in May 1925]]\n\n1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts:  chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry.

The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used [[party discipline]] to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIV Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky addresses the meeting in the [[House of the Unions]] in March 1926]]\n\n=== United Opposition (1926\u20131927) ===\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition]].\n\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\n\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A.

Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J.

Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.\n\n<br />\n\n===Defeat and exile (1927\u20131928)===\nIn October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XV Party Congress]], which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]], in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to [[Turkey]] in February 1929, accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and their eldest son, [[Lev Sedov|Lev]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Joshua |title=Leon Trotsky: a revolutionary's life |year=2011 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300137248 |pages=155\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929\u20131941)===\n[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: \"On the service of bourgeoisie\"]]\n\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year.

Trotsky's grave is located on its grounds. The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.\n\nTrotsky was never formally [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the [[Glasnost]]-era rehabilitation of most other [[Old Bolshevik|Old Bolsheviks]] killed during the Great Purges. His son, [[Sergei Sedov]], who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\n\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|General Prosecutor's Office]] (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").<ref>[http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html \u0412. \u0412. \u0418\u043e\u0444\u0435. \u041e\u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821184248/http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html |date=21 August 2011 }} \u041d\u0418\u0426 \u00ab\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u00bb</ref>\n\nIn the allegorical novel [[Animal Farm]] by [[George Orwell]] based on the [[Russian Revolution]], Trotsky is portrayed by the character Snowball, a pig.\n\n==Contributions to theory==\n{{Main|Trotskyism}}\n\nTrotsky considered himself a \"Bolshevik-Leninist,\" arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]]. He viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox Marxism.<ref>Michael Cox, \"Trotsky and his interpreters; or, will the real Leon Trotsky please stand up?\" ''Russian Review''  51#1 (1992) pp 84+.</ref>\n\nHis politics differed in some respects from those of Stalin or [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in his rejection of the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] and his declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]].\" Numerous [[Fourth International|Fourth Internationalist]] groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition. However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating [[political revolution]], and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.<ref>Erik Van Ree, \"Socialism in One Country: A Reassessment\" ''Studies in East European Thought'' 50#2 (1998) pp 77-117.</ref>\n\n=== Permanent Revolution ===\n{{Main|Permanent revolution}}\n[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural depicts Trotsky with [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] as a true champion of the workers' struggle]]\n\nPermanent Revolution is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:\n\n{{Quote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far \u2013 not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world \u2013 that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: '''The Permanent Revolution'''.}}\n\nTrotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904\u20131905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905''and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"[[Results and Prospects]].\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the [[Third World]] shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editorial Board|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529173202/http://wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|archive-date=29 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===The United Front===\n{{Main|United Front}}\nTrotsky was a central figure in the [[Comintern]] during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the [[united front]], a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\n\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party in]] [[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]], his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.<ref>Joseph Choonara, [http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 \"The United Front\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107230355/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 |date=7 January 2008 }}, ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'', 117</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal||Politics|Philosophy|History|Russia|Ukraine|Soviet Union|Mexico|Communism|Socialism|Religion}}\n* [[Fourth International]]\n* [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Group of Democratic Centralism]]\n* [[Labor army]]\n* [[List of books by Leon Trotsky]]\n* [[List of Trotskyist internationals]]\n* [[List of Trotskyist organizations by country]]\n* ''[[Frida]]'', 2002 film\n* ''[[Variations on the Death of Trotsky]]'', 1991 play\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Blackledge|date=2006|title=Leon Trotsky's Contribution to the Marxist Theory of History|journal=Studies in East European Thought|volume=58|issue= 1|pages=1\u201331|doi=10.1007/s11212-005-3677-z|ref=1\u201331}}\n* {{cite book|first=Tony|last=Cliff|date=1989\u201393|title=Trotsky|volume=4 Vols.|place=London|publisher= Bookmarks|ref=harv}}\n* Cox, Michael. \"Trotsky and His Interpreters; or, Will the Real Leon Trotsky Please Stand up?\" ''Russian Review'' 51#1, (1992), pp.&nbsp;84\u2013102 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/131248 online]\n* {{cite book|author=Isaac Deutscher|title=Trotsky: The Prophet Armed|date=1954|ref=harv|author-link=Isaac Deutscher}} [https://archive.org/details/prophetarmedtrot00deut online free to borrow]\n* Isaac Deutscher:\n** (1959) ''Trotsky: The Prophet Unarmed''\n** (1963) ''Trotsky: The Prophet Outcast''\n* Isaac Deutscher (1966) ''Ironies of History''.\n* Daniels, Robert V (1991) ''Trotsky, Stalin & Socialism''.
