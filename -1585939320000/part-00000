Throughout the season, Rivera formed an important relationship with the legendary manager and [[catenaccio]] mastermind; he played a key role in the club's successes under Rocco, who subsequently built a hard-working, winning team around Rivera that complemented the midfielder's creative playing style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/it/archive/show_player/Gianni-Rivera|title=AC Milan Hall of Fame: Gianni Rivera|publisher=A.C.Milan.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt started with the grand success at home against Juventus (5-1), and then created an unstoppable winning streak for Milan, that would see them only lose once in twenty-one matches. It would also be a defeat for Juventus back in their own home town that year, as Milan delivered a 4\u20132 win.\n\nIt would seem Rocco's only regret of the 1961\u201362 season would be in the Milano Derby as Inter won with the result 2\u20130.  In spite of those who accused the father and pioneer of the real catenaccio, Milan gave way to dominate the field with eighty-three goals scored in thirty-four games (an average of 2.4 goals per match) and with thirty-four goals conceded. While Juventus was nowhere near the top contention that year, Inter, Fiorentina, and Bologna were the only true runner-ups for the scudetto race.\n\nThat same year, Milan played in the Fourth Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (this was the predecessor of the UEFA Europa League Cup), however, Milan did not go far and lost in the first round against the Yugoslavian team Novi Sud.\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Luciano Alfieri]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giorgio Ghezzi]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Liberalato]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Cesare Maldini]]|pos=DF}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Pasinato]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Luigi Radice]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Sandro Salvadore]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giovanni Trapattoni]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Trebbi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Francesco Zagatti]]|pos=DF}}<ref>Captain in 1961</ref>\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario David]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giovanni Lodetti]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Ambrogio Pelagalli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianni Rivera]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=BRA|name=[[Dino Sani]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Tenente]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=BRA|name=[[Jos\u00e9 Altafini]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Paolo Barison]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Bruno Beretti]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Oliviero Conti]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giancarlo Danova]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Del Vecchio]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=URU|name=[[Alcides Ghiggia]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Gino Pivatelli]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Orlando Rozzoni]]<ref>Loaned in from [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] to play [[Coppa dell'Amicizia (calcio)|Coppa dell'Amicizia italo-franco-svizzera]].</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n====Loan out====\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Paolo Ferrario]]|pos=FW|other=to [[Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Lazio|Lazio]] from november 1961}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|name=[[Jimmy Greaves]]|pos=FW|other=to [[Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|Tottenham]] from november 1961}}\n{{fs end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | In\n|-\n! width=3% | Pos.\n! width=32% | Name\n! width=30% | from\n! width=35% | Type\n|-\n| FW || [[Oliviero Conti]] || [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]]||}} || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Giancarlo Danova]] || [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Emanuele Del Vecchio]] || [[Padova Calcio]] || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Paolo Ferrario]] || [[S.S.

Throughout the season, Rivera formed an important relationship with the legendary manager and [[catenaccio]] mastermind; he played a key role in the club's successes under Rocco, who subsequently built a hard-working, winning team around Rivera that complemented the midfielder's creative playing style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/it/archive/show_player/Gianni-Rivera|title=AC Milan Hall of Fame: Gianni Rivera|publisher=A.C.Milan.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt started with the grand success at home against Juventus (5-1), and then created an unstoppable winning streak for Milan, that would see them only lose once in twenty-one matches. It would also be a defeat for Juventus back in their own home town that year, as Milan delivered a 4\u20132 win.\n\nIt would seem Rocco's only regret of the 1961\u201362 season would be in the Milano Derby as Inter won with the result 2\u20130.  In spite of those who accused the father and pioneer of the real catenaccio, Milan gave way to dominate the field with eighty-three goals scored in thirty-four games (an average of 2.4 goals per match) and with thirty-four goals conceded. While Juventus was nowhere near the top contention that year, Inter, Fiorentina, and Bologna were the only true runner-ups for the scudetto race.\n\nThat same year, Milan played in the Fourth Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (this was the predecessor of the UEFA Europa League Cup), however, Milan did not go far and lost in the first round against the Yugoslavian team Novi Sud.\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Luciano Alfieri]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giorgio Ghezzi]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Liberalato]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Cesare Maldini]]|pos=DF}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Pasinato]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Luigi Radice]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Sandro Salvadore]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giovanni Trapattoni]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Trebbi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Francesco Zagatti]]|pos=DF}}<ref>Captain in 1961</ref>\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario David]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giovanni Lodetti]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Ambrogio Pelagalli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianni Rivera]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=BRA|name=[[Dino Sani]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Tenente]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=BRA|name=[[Jos\u00e9 Altafini]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Paolo Barison]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Bruno Beretti]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Oliviero Conti]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Giancarlo Danova]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Del Vecchio]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=URU|name=[[Alcides Ghiggia]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Gino Pivatelli]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Orlando Rozzoni]]<ref>Loaned in from [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] to play [[Coppa dell'Amicizia (calcio)|Coppa dell'Amicizia italo-franco-svizzera]].</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n====Loan out====\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ITA|name=[[Paolo Ferrario]]|pos=FW|other=to [[Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Lazio|Lazio]] from november 1961}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|name=[[Jimmy Greaves]]|pos=FW|other=to [[Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|Tottenham]] from november 1961}}\n{{fs end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | In\n|-\n! width=3% | Pos.\n! width=32% | Name\n! width=30% | from\n! width=35% | Type\n|-\n| FW || [[Oliviero Conti]] || [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]]||}} || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Giancarlo Danova]] || [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Emanuele Del Vecchio]] || [[Padova Calcio]] || -\n|-\n| FW || [[Paolo Ferrario]] || [[S.S.

Each [[city]], [[Monarchy|kingdom]] and trade [[guild]] had its own standards until the formation of the [[Akkadian Empire]] when [[Sargon of Akkad]] issued a common standard.  This standard was improved by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], but fell into disuse after the Akkadian Empire dissolved.  The standard of Naram-Sin was readopted in the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III period]] by the [[Nan\u0161e Hymn]] which reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings.  Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.\n\nThe Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.<ref>Conder 1908, p. 87.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.\n\nIn 1916, during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in the middle of [[World War I]], the German [[Assyriology|assyriologist]] [[Eckhard Unger]] found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from c. 2650 BC and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard.

In the [[Tosefta]] (''Kelim Baba-Metsia'' 6:12\u201313), however, it brings down a second opinion, namely, that of [[Rabbi Meir]], who distinguishes between a medium-sized cubit of 5 handbreadths, used principally for rabbinic measurements in measuring the bare and untilled ground near a vineyard and where there is a prohibition to grow therein seed plants under the laws of [[Diverse kinds|Diverse Kinds]], and a larger cubit of 6 handbreadths used to measure therewith the altar.

Each [[city]], [[Monarchy|kingdom]] and trade [[guild]] had its own standards until the formation of the [[Akkadian Empire]] when [[Sargon of Akkad]] issued a common standard.  This standard was improved by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], but fell into disuse after the Akkadian Empire dissolved.  The standard of Naram-Sin was readopted in the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III period]] by the [[Nan\u0161e Hymn]] which reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings.  Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.\n\nThe Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.<ref>Conder 1908, p. 87.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.\n\nIn 1916, during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in the middle of [[World War I]], the German [[Assyriology|assyriologist]] [[Eckhard Unger]] found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from c. 2650 BC and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard. This irregularly formed and irregularly marked graduated rule supposedly defined the Sumerian cubit as about {{convert|518.6|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=acta/>\n\n==Biblical cubit==\n{{Main|Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement}}\nThe standard of the cubit in different countries and in different ages has varied.

In the [[Tosefta]] (''Kelim Baba-Metsia'' 6:12\u201313), however, it brings down a second opinion, namely, that of [[Rabbi Meir]], who distinguishes between a medium-sized cubit of 5 handbreadths, used principally for rabbinic measurements in measuring the bare and untilled ground near a vineyard and where there is a prohibition to grow therein seed plants under the laws of [[Diverse kinds|Diverse Kinds]], and a larger cubit of 6 handbreadths used to measure therewith the altar.

This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tom\u00e1s Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|journal=RT\u00c9 News|access-date=21 August 2016|date=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Tom\u00e1s Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister \u2013 Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tom\u00e1s Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

However he also criticised the new 12-month deferral policy on MSM and called on Ireland's Health Minister to initiate a review of the IBTS and replace the 12-month deferral period for MSM with no deferral or a 3-month deferral on all donors following sexual intercourse.<ref>http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blood-transfusion-service-finally-lifts-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood-439426.html|title=Blood Transfusion Service finally lifts ban on gay men donating blood|date=17 January 2017|work=Irish Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gay-donor-tooth-and-nail-battle-to-give-blood-at-an-end-1.2939185|title=Gay donor: 'Tooth and nail' battle to give blood at an end|work=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/231273/i-abstained-from-sex-for-23-months-gay-ul-student-wins-fight-over-blood-donations.html|title='I abstained from sex for 23 months': Gay UL student wins fight over blood donations}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 May 2019, Heneghan (27) initiated a fresh legal challenge in the High Court against the blanket deferral on men who have had oral or anal sex with another man in the previous 12-month period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/policy-on-gay-men-donating-blood-challenged-in-high-court-1.3898662/|title=Policy on gay men donating blood challenged in High Court|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|website=Irishtimes.com|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/high-court-challenge-gay-men-sex-blood-donation-4644270-May2019/|title=Man brings High Court challenge over IBTS policy on gay men donating blood|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/gay-man-challenges-blood-donor-sex-policy-lq3rfpgsz|title=Gay man challenges blood donor sex policy|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=25 May 2019|date=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/man-brings-court-challenge-against-blood-transfusion-service-after-they-prevented-him-from-donating-38129815.html|title=Man brings court challenge against blood transfusion service after they prevented him from donating|website=independent.ie|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nHeneghan claims he cannot understand the reasoning behind the IBTS policy and argues that the questionnaire does not enable the IBTS to make a full evaluation of the level of risk presented by an individual donor due to their sexual behaviour. He also states that according to the IBTS's own website, there is a window period following infection during which HIV and hepatitis may not be detected in the blood and that this window is seven days for HIV and 16 days for hepatitis. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case is due to return to the court in July 2019.\n\nIn July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews.

Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. If a woman has had sexual contact with a man who has had sex with a man in the last year, she must wait three months from last sexual contact \u202fbefore donating blood.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/blood/am-i-eligible/men-who-have-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Activism regarding reform of MSM donor policies==\n\n===Student and faculty activism on campuses===\n'''In Canada'''\n* The students association at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/07/10/ottawa-carleton-university-students-ban-blood-clinics-gay-man-policy.html |title=Blood clinic ban on campus upheld due to policy on gay men|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=10 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''In the United States'''<ref name=\"FDA\" />\n\n*In 2005, a student activist at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) filed a complaint with the university's Office of Affirmative Action, contending that American Red Cross blood drives on campus violated UVM's non-discrimination policy.

This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tom\u00e1s Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|journal=RT\u00c9 News|access-date=21 August 2016|date=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Tom\u00e1s Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister \u2013 Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tom\u00e1s Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

He also states that according to the IBTS's own website, there is a window period following infection during which HIV and hepatitis may not be detected in the blood and that this window is seven days for HIV and 16 days for hepatitis. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case is due to return to the court in July 2019.\n\nIn July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission has informed the man his complaints will now be considered in light of EU law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcn.ie/irish-man-files-formal-complaint-with-european-commission-over-gay-blood-ban/|title=Irish man files formal complaint with European Commission over gay blood ban|first=Peter|last=Dunne|website=GCN.ie|accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to \"high risk sexual contact.\"  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive \"Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood\", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. H\u00e9lder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.<ref name=tvi24-29April2015a>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais s\u00f3 podem dar sangue em abstin\u00eancia sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that \"sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor\" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que \"contacto sexual de homens com outros homens \u00e9 definido como fator de risco\")}}</ref>\n\nIn Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on \"appropriately reasoned epidemiological information\" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.\n\nSince 10 July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nAt the formation of the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) in 1998, the deferral period had been 10 years, but was reduced to 5 years in 2009.

This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat hemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on hemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.<ref name=\"NZBS-criteriareview\" /> Screening out those at high risk of blood borne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.\n\n==Criticism of the restrictions==\n===Need for blood===\nObjections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=Policies on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & Queer (LGBTQ) Issues \u2013 AMA|website=www.ama-assn.org}}</ref> and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level.

In 2018, approximately 10,000 donations were still urgently needed by 10 March to continue to meet patients' needs.

Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely.

{"title_page": "Health Level 7", "text_new": "{{short description|Set of standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data}}\n{{About|the family of standards|the organization that created them|Health Level Seven International}}\n\n\n'''Health Level Seven''' or '''HL7''' refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is \"layer 7\" in the [[OSI model]]. The HL7 standards are produced by [[Health Level Seven International]], an international [[standards organization]], and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as [[ANSI|American National Standards Institute]] and [[ISO|International Organization for Standardization]].\n\nHospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking.  All of these systems should communicate with each other (or \"interface\") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so.\n\n[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joel Rodrigues|title=Health Information Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnBJsRtfVbYC&pg=PR39|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-988-5|year=2010|page=xxxix}}</ref>\n\n[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] considers the following standards to be its primary standards \u2013 those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:<ref name=\"HL7 Primary Standards\">{{cite web|title=HL7 Primary Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=1|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}</ref>\n* Version 2.x Messaging Standard \u2013 an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions\n* Version 3 Messaging Standard \u2013 an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions\n* [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) \u2013 an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3\n* [[Continuity of Care Document]] (CCD) \u2013 a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.\n* [[Structured Product Labeling]] (SPL) \u2013 the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3\n* [[Clinical Context Object Workgroup]] (CCOW) \u2013 an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications\n \nOther HL7 standards/methodologies include:<ref>{{cite web|title=HL7 Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}</ref>\n* [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] (FHIR) \u2013 a standard for the exchange of resources  \n* [[Arden Syntax]] \u2013 a grammar for representing medical conditions and recommendations as a [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Module]] (MLM)\n* Claims Attachments \u2013 a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction\n* Functional Specification of [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) / [[Personal health record|Personal Health Record]] (PHR) systems \u2013 a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications\n* [[Gello Expression Language|GELLO]] \u2013 a standard expression language used for clinical decision support\n\n==Primary standards==\nHL7's primary standards are those standards that [[Health Level Seven International]] considers to be most commonly used and implemented.<ref name=\"HL7 Primary Standards\"/>\n\n===Version 2 messaging===\nThe HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows.

Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. The v2.x standards are [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] (e.g., a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6).\n\nHL7 v2.x messages use a non-[[XML]] encoding syntax based on segments ([[Line (text file)|line]]s) and one-character [[delimiter]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding HL7 Messages|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/understanding_hl7_messages.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}</ref> Segments have composites ([[Field (computer science)|field]]s) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are [[carriage return]] for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (<code>|</code>) for the field separator, caret (<code>^</code>) for the component separator, ampersand (<code>&</code>) for the subcomponent separator, and number sign (#) for the default truncation separator.

These standards focus on the application layer, which is \"layer 7\" in the [[OSI model]]. The HL7 standards are produced by [[Health Level Seven International]], an international [[standards organization]], and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as [[ANSI|American National Standards Institute]] and [[ISO|International Organization for Standardization]].\n\nHospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking.  All of these systems should communicate with each other (or \"interface\") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so.\n\n[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joel Rodrigues|title=Health Information Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnBJsRtfVbYC&pg=PR39|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-988-5|year=2010|page=xxxix}}</ref>\n\n[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] considers the following standards to be its primary standards \u2013 those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:<ref name=\"HL7 Primary Standards\">{{cite web|title=HL7 Primary Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=1|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}</ref>\n* Version 2.x Messaging Standard \u2013 an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions\n* Version 3 Messaging Standard \u2013 an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions\n* [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) \u2013 an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3\n* [[Continuity of Care Document]] (CCD) \u2013 a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.\n* [[Structured Product Labeling]] (SPL) \u2013 the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3\n* [[Clinical Context Object Workgroup]] (CCOW) \u2013 an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications\n \nOther HL7 standards/methodologies include:<ref>{{cite web|title=HL7 Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}</ref>\n* [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] (FHIR) \u2013 a standard for the exchange of resources  \n* [[Arden Syntax]] \u2013 a grammar for representing medical conditions and recommendations as a [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Module]] (MLM)\n* Claims Attachments \u2013 a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction\n* Functional Specification of [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) / [[Personal health record|Personal Health Record]] (PHR) systems \u2013 a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications\n* [[Gello Expression Language|GELLO]] \u2013 a standard expression language used for clinical decision support\n\n==Primary standards==\nHL7's primary standards are those standards that [[Health Level Seven International]] considers to be most commonly used and implemented.<ref name=\"HL7 Primary Standards\"/>\n\n===Version 2 messaging===\nThe HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows.

The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using.\n\n'''V3 Messaging'''\n\nThe HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages (called ''interactions'') to support all healthcare workflows.\n\nHL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:<ref>{{cite web|editor-last=Spronk|editor-first=Ren\u00e9|title=HL7 Message examples: version 2 and version 3|url=http://www.ringholm.de/docs/04300_en.htm|work=Ringholm|publisher=Ringholm bv|date=16 November 2007|ref=harv}}</ref>{{rp|2.2.1}}\n\n<!--Sample code from Spronk 2007, CC BY-SA 3.0-->\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"xml\"><POLB_IN224200 ITSVersion=\"XML_1.0\" xmlns=\"urn:hl7-org:v3\"\n xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n  <id root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.19.1122.7\" extension=\"CNTRL-3456\"/>\n  <creationTime value=\"200202150930-0400\"/>\n  <!-- The version of the datatypes/RIM/vocabulary used is that of May 2006 -->\n  <versionCode code=\"2006-05\"/>\n  <!-- interaction id= Observation Event Complete, w/o Receiver Responsibilities -->\n  <interactionId root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.1.6\" extension=\"POLB_IN224200\"/>\n  <processingCode code=\"P\"/>\n  <processingModeCode nullFlavor=\"OTH\"/>\n  <acceptAckCode code=\"ER\"/>\n  <receiver typeCode=\"RCV\">\n    <device classCode=\"DEV\" determinerCode=\"INSTANCE\">\n      <id extension=\"GHH LAB\" root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.19.1122.1\"/>\n      <asLocatedEntity classCode=\"LOCE\">\n        <location classCode=\"PLC\" determinerCode=\"INSTANCE\">\n          <id root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.19.1122.2\" extension=\"ELAB-3\"/>\n        </location>\n      </asLocatedEntity>\n    </device>\n  </receiver>\n  <sender typeCode=\"SND\">\n    <device classCode=\"DEV\" determinerCode=\"INSTANCE\">\n      <id root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.19.1122.1\" extension=\"GHH OE\"/>\n      <asLocatedEntity classCode=\"LOCE\">\n        <location classCode=\"PLC\" determinerCode=\"INSTANCE\">\n          <id root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.19.1122.2\" extension=\"BLDG24\"/>\n        </location>\n      </asLocatedEntity>\n    </device>\n  </sender>\n  <!-- Trigger Event Control Act & Domain Content -->\n</POLB_IN224200></syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)===\n{{main|Clinical Document Architecture}}\n\nThe HL7 [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange.<ref>{{cite book|title=The CDA Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwa6DDB4jY8C}}</ref> The standard was jointly published with ISO as ISO/HL7 27932.\n\n===Continuity of Care Document (CCD)===\n{{main|Continuity of Care Document}}\nCCD is a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.\n\n===Structured Product Labeling (SPL)===\n{{main|Structured Product Labeling}}\n\nSPL describes the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3.\n\n===CCOW===\n{{main|CCOW}}\n[[CCOW]], or \"Clinical Context Object Workgroup,\" is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level.  CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications.\n\n==Other standards and methods==\n\n===Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)===\n{{main|Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources}}\nFast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a draft standard from [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] designed to be easier to implement, more open and more extensible than version 2.x or version 3.  It leverages a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a [[HTTP]]-based [[RESTful]]  protocol, [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for user interface integration, a choice of [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for data representation, [[OAuth]] for authorization and [[ATOM]] for query results.<ref name=forbes>{{cite news\n | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/03/30/setting-healthcare-interop-on-fire/\n | title=Setting Healthcare Interop On Fire\n | work=[[Forbes]]\n | author=Dan Munro\n | date=2014-03-30\n | accessdate=2014-11-22 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Services Aware Interoperability Framework===\n{{main|HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework}}\n\nThe HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.\n\nSAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.\n\nSAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.\n\n=== Arden syntax ===\n{{main|Arden syntax}}\nThe [[Arden syntax]] is a language for encoding medical knowledge. [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Modules]] ([[Medical logic module|MLM]]s) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support.  An [[Medical logic module|MLM]] must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed.  Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed.\n\n===MLLP===\nA large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP).<ref>{{cite web|title=LLP - Lower Layer Protocol|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/llp.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}</ref> For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft,<ref>{{cite web|title=MLLP Receive and Send Components|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee409260%28BTS.10%29.aspx|publisher=[[MSDN]]}}</ref> Oracle<ref>{{cite web|title=Oracle Application Server Integration B2B User's Guide, Supported Protocols|url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14099_19/integrate.1012/b19370/supp_protos.htm#BACIFDJG|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]}}</ref> and [[Cleo (company)|Cleo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Which Secure Managed File Transfer Protocol is Right for You?|url=https://www.cleo.com/solutions/compare-protocols/|publisher=[[Cleo (company)|Cleo]]|access-date=2015-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607155326/http://www.cleo.com/solutions/compare-protocols/|archive-date=2015-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Functional EHR and PHR specifications===\nFunctional specifications for an [[electronic health record]].\n\n== Message details ==\n\n===The OBR segment===\nAn OBR Segment carries information about an exam, diagnostic study/observation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The HL7 OBR segment|url=https://corepointhealth.com/resource-center/hl7-resources/hl7-obr-segment/|publisher=Corepoint Health | accessdate=2018-11-13}}</ref> It is a required segment in an ORM (order message)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/calendarofevents/FirstTime/Glossary%20of%20terms.pdf|title=HL7 Glossary of Terms|website=www.hl7.org|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> or an ORU (Observation Result) message<ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthstandards.com/blog/2006/10/05/what-is-an-oru-message/|title=What Is an ORU Message?|publisher=Health Standards|accessdate=2018-11-13}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium|CDISC]]\n* [[DICOM]]\n* [[DVTk]]\n* [[Electronic medical record]]\n* [[eHealth]]\n* [[EHRcom]]\n* [[European Institute for Health Records]] ([[European Union]])\n* [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]]\n* [[Health Informatics]]\n* [[Health Informatics Service Architecture]] (HISA)\n* [[Healthcare Services Specification Project]] (HSSP)\n* [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise(IHE)]]\n* [[ISO TC 215]]\n* [[LOINC]]\n* [[NextGen Connect]]\n* [[openEHR|openEHR Foundation]]\n* [[Public Health Information Network]]\n* [[SNOMED]], [[SNOMED CT]]\n* [[NPU terminology|Nomenclature for Properties and Units terminology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Open-source attribution|license=Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license|{{harvnb|Spronk|2007}}.}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.HL7.org/ HL7.org site]\n* [http://www.ehealthtraining.com.au/ What does HL7 education mean?]\n* [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] is a member of the [http://www.jointinitiativecouncil.org/ Joint Initiative on SDO Global Health Informatics Standardization]\n* [http://www.eHealthTraining.com.au/HL7-Tools.htm HL7 Tools Page]\n* [http://www.AHML.com.au/ Australian Healthcare Messaging Laboratory (AHML) - Online HL7 Message Testing and Certification]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722053000/http://aurora.regenstrief.org/javasig Comprehensive Implementation of HL7 v3 Specifications in Java]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024051/http://www.cs.duke.edu/~jgm/files/nist.2006.ppt NIST HL7 Conformance Testing Framework]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100413213254/http://www.globalsubmit.com/home/LearningCenter/HL7RegulatedProductSubmissions/tabid/252/Default.aspx ICH-HL7 Regulated Product Submissions]\n* [http://www.hl7soup.com/hl7tutorials.html HL7 Tutorial Directory]\n* [https://saravanansubramanian.com/hl7tutorials/ HL7 Programming Tutorials], Short Tutorials on many HL7 concepts for Programmers.\n\n===Critical reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100612005842/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/HL7/doublestandards.pdf HL7 RIM: An Incoherent Standard]  \n*[http://amisha.pragmaticdata.com/~schadow/Schadow-MIE06-r3.pdf HL7 RIM Under Scrutiny] (attempted rebuttal)(publication date?)\n* [http://hl7-watch.blogspot.com/ HL7 WATCH]\n* Update 2013: [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/HL7/RIM-2013.pdf Human Action in the Healthcare Domain: A Critical Analysis of HL7\u2019s Reference Information Model]\n \n{{Health informatics}}\n{{health software}}\n\n[[Category:International standards]]\n[[Category:Multi-agent systems]]\n[[Category:ANSI standards]]\n[[Category:Standards for electronic health records]]\n[[Category:Data coding framework]]\n", "name_user": "NitrusIX", "label": "safe", "comment": "add ref to MLP as an Also Known As. point out lack of security and reference other protocols used outside hospitals.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7"}
