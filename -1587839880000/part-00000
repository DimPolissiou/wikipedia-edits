Ing\u00f3lfur is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional Norse method: he cast his [[high seat pillars]] (\u00d6ndvegiss\u00falur) into the ocean when he saw the coastline, then settled where the pillars came to shore. This story is widely regarded as a legend; it appears likely that he settled near the hot springs to keep warm in the winter and would not have decided the location by happenstance. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the pillars drifted to that location from where they were said to have been thrown from the boat. Nevertheless, that is what the ''Landnamabok'' says, and it says furthermore that Ing\u00f3lfur's pillars are still to be found in a house in the town.\n\nSteam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjav\u00edk's name, which loosely translates to Smoke Cove (the city is sometimes referred to as ''Bay of Smoke'' or ''Smoky Bay'' in English language travel guides).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1 |title=Google.com |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014024/http://www.google.com/search?q=reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 |archive-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1&gws_rd=cr#tbm=bks&q=Reykjavik+%22smoky+bay%22 |title=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> In the modern language, as in English, the word for 'smoke' and the word for fog or steamy vapour are not commonly confused, but this is believed to have been the case in the old language.\nThe original name was Reykja'''r'''v\u00edk (with an additional \"r\" representing the usual genitive ending of strong nouns) but this had vanished around 1800.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 Er eitthvert \u00f6rnefni \u00e1 h\u00f6fu\u00f0borgarsv\u00e6\u00f0inu e\u00f0a v\u00edk e\u00f0a vogur, sem heitir Reykjav\u00edk?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112309/https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 |date=2017-11-07 }}.

In 1752, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederik V of Denmark]] donated the estate of Reykjav\u00edk to the [[Innr\u00e9ttingar Corporation]]; the name comes from the [[Danish language|Danish-language]] word ''indretninger'', meaning institution. The leader of this movement was {{Interlanguage link multi|Sk\u00fali Magn\u00fasson|is}}. In the 1750s, several houses were built to house the [[wool]] industry, which was Reykjav\u00edk's most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence. Other industries were undertaken by the Innr\u00e9ttingar, such as [[fishing|fisheries]], [[sulfur|sulphur mining]], agriculture, and shipbuilding.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 Hva\u00f0an kemur nafni\u00f0 \"Innr\u00e9ttingarnar\" \u00e1 fyrirt\u00e6kinu sem starfa\u00f0i h\u00e9r \u00e1 \u00e1 18. \u00f6ld?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910092150/http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 |date=2016-09-10 }}. V\u00edsindavefur. (in Icelandic)</ref>\n\nThe Danish Crown abolished monopoly trading in 1786 and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter. Reykjav\u00edk was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently. 1786 is thus regarded as the date of the city's founding. Trading rights were limited to subjects of the Danish Crown, and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland. Over the following decades, their business in Iceland expanded. After 1880, [[free trade]] was expanded to all nationalities, and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow.\n\n===Rise of nationalism===\n[[File:Pg107 Main street of Reykjavik and Governors house.jpg|thumb|Reykjav\u00edk in 1881]]\n\n[[Icelandic nationalism|Icelandic nationalist]] sentiment gained influence in the 19th century, and the idea of Icelandic independence became widespread. Reykjav\u00edk, as Iceland's only city, was central to such ideas. Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjav\u00edk was fundamental to that objective. All the important events in the history of the independence struggle were important to Reykjav\u00edk as well. In 1845 [[Althing|Al\u00feingi]], the general assembly formed in 930 AD, was re-established in Reykjav\u00edk; it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at [[\u00deingvellir]]. At the time it functioned only as an advisory assembly, advising the king about Icelandic affairs. The location of Al\u00feingi in Reykjav\u00edk effectively established the city as the capital of Iceland.\n\nIn 1874, Iceland was given a constitution; with it, Al\u00feingi gained some limited legislative powers and in essence became the institution that it is today. The next step was to move most of the executive power to Iceland: [[Home rule|Home Rule]] was granted in 1904 when the office of [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Minister For Iceland]] was established in Reykjav\u00edk. The biggest step towards an independent Iceland was taken on 1 December 1918 when Iceland became a sovereign country under the [[List of Danish monarchs|Crown of Denmark]], the [[Kingdom of Iceland]].\n\nBy the 1920s and 1930s most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjav\u00edk; [[cod]] production was its main industry, but the [[Great Depression]] hit Reykjav\u00edk hard with unemployment, and labour union struggles sometimes became violent.\n\n===World War II===\nOn the morning of 10 May 1940, following the German occupation of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] on 9 April 1940, four British warships approached Reykjav\u00edk and anchored in the harbour. In a few hours, the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Invasion of Iceland|occupation of Reykjav\u00edk]] was complete. There was no armed resistance, and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force, which initially had no motor vehicles. The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government to consent to the occupation, but it always declined on the basis of the [[Neutral country|Neutrality Policy]]. For the remaining years of [[World War II]], British and later American soldiers occupied camps in Reykjav\u00edk, and the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjav\u00edk became about the same as the local population of the city. [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] formed part of the garrison in Iceland during the early part of the war.\n\nThe economic effects of the occupation were positive for Reykjav\u00edk: the unemployment of the Depression years vanished, and construction work began. The British built [[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]], which is still in service today, mostly for short haul flights (to domestic destinations and Greenland). The Americans, meanwhile, built [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport|Keflav\u00edk Airport]], situated {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Reykjav\u00edk, which became Iceland's primary international airport. In 1944, the Republic of Iceland was founded and a [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]], elected by the people, replaced the king; the office of the president was placed in Reykjav\u00edk.\n\n===Post-war development===\nIn the post-war years, the growth of Reykjav\u00edk accelerated. An exodus from the rural countryside began, largely because improved technology in agriculture reduced the need for manpower, and because of a population boom resulting from better living conditions in the country. A once-primitive village was rapidly transformed into a modern city. Private cars became common, and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs.\n\nIn 1972, Reykjav\u00edk hosted the [[World Chess Championship 1972|world chess championship]] between [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]]. The 1986 [[Reykjav\u00edk Summit]] between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underlined Reykjav\u00edk's international status. [[Deregulation]] in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s again transformed Reykjav\u00edk. The financial and IT sectors are now significant employers in the city. The city has fostered some world-famous talents in recent decades, such as [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[\u00d3lafur Arnalds]] and bands [[M\u00fam]], [[Sigur R\u00f3s]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], poet [[Sj\u00f3n]] and visual artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Reykjavikfromabove.jpg|thumb|Reykjav\u00edk seen from above]]\n[[File:Reykjavik Esja.jpg|thumb|[[Esjan|Esja]], the mountain range to the north of Reykjav\u00edk]]\n\nReykjav\u00edk is located in the southwest of [[Iceland]]. The Reykjav\u00edk area coastline is characterized by peninsulas, coves, straits, and islands.\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]] (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered parts of the city area, reaching as far out as [[\u00c1lftanes]]. Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water. In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age, some hills like \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0 were islands. The former sea level is indicated by sediments (with clams) reaching (at \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0, for example) as far as {{convert|43|m|0|abbr=on}} above the current sea level. The hills of \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0 and Sk\u00f3lav\u00f6r\u00f0uholt appear to be the remains of former [[shield volcanoes]] which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away, and began to look as it does today.\n\nThe capital city area continued to be shaped by earthquakes and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], like the one 4,500 years ago in the mountain range Bl\u00e1fj\u00f6ll, when the lava coming down the Elli\u00f0a\u00e1 valley reached the sea at the bay of Elli\u00f0avogur.\n\nThe largest river to run through Reykjav\u00edk is the [[Elli\u00f0a\u00e1r|Elli\u00f0a\u00e1]] River, which is non-navigable. It is one of the best [[salmon]] fishing rivers in the country. Mount [[Esja]], at {{convert|914|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nThe city of Reykjav\u00edk is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east. Reykjav\u00edk is a spread-out city: most of its urban area consists of low-density suburbs, and houses are usually widely spaced. The outer residential neighbourhoods are also widely spaced from each other; in between them are the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty space. The city's latitude is 64\u00b008' N, making it the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost capital]] of a sovereign state ([[Nuuk]], the capital of [[Greenland]], is slightly further north at 64\u00b010', but Greenland is a [[Denmark#Greenland and the Faroe Islands|constituent country]], not an independent state).\n\n{{wide image|Reykjavik_Perlan.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Reykjav\u00edk seen from [[Perlan]] with the mountains Akrafjall (middle) and [[Esjan|Esja]] (right) in the background}}\n{{wide image|Vista de Reikiavik desde Perlan, Distrito de la Capital, Islandia, 2014-08-13, DD 134-145 HDR PAN.JPG|1200px|Panorama of Reykjav\u00edk seen from [[Perlan]] at sunset in summer.

From 20 May to 24 July, daylight is essentially permanent as the sun never gets more than 5\u00b0 below the horizon. Day length drops to less than five hours between 2 December and 10 January. The sun climbs just 3\u00b0 above the horizon during this time. However, day length begins increasing rapidly during January and by month's end there are seven hours of daylight.\n\nDespite its northern latitude, temperatures very rarely drop below {{convert|-15|C|0}} in the winter.

The council has 23 members who are elected using the [[open list]] method for four-year terms.\n\nThe council selects members of boards, and each board controls a different field under the city council's authority. The most important board is the City Board that wields the executive rights along with the City Mayor. The City Mayor is the senior public official and also the director of city operations. Other public officials control city institutions under the mayor's authority. Thus, the administration consists of two different parts:\n*The political power of City Council cascading down to other boards\n*Public officials under the authority of the city mayor who administer and manage implementation of policy.\n\n===Political control===\nThe [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] was historically the city's ruling party; it had an overall majority from its establishment in 1929 until 1978, when it narrowly lost. From 1978 until 1982, there was a three-party coalition composed of the [[People's Alliance (Iceland)|People's Alliance]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. In 1982, the Independence Party regained an overall majority, which it held for three consecutive terms. The 1994 election was won by [[Reykjav\u00edkurlistinn]] (the R-list), an alliance of Icelandic socialist parties, led by [[Ingibj\u00f6rg S\u00f3lr\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir]]. This alliance won a majority in three consecutive elections, but was dissolved for the 2006 election when five different parties were on the ballot. The Independence Party won seven seats, and together with the one Progressive Party they were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006.\n\nIn October 2007 a new majority was formed on the council, consisting of members of the Progressive Party, the [[Social Democratic Alliance]], the [[Left-Green Movement|Left-Greens]] and the F-list (liberals and independents), after controversy regarding REI, a subsidiary of OR, the city's energy company. However, three months later the F-list formed a new majority together with the Independence Party. [[\u00d3lafur Fri\u00f0rik Magn\u00fasson|\u00d3lafur F. Magn\u00fasson]], the leader of the F-list, was elected mayor on 24 January 2008, and in March 2009 the Independence Party was due to appoint a new mayor. This changed once again on 14 August 2008 when the fourth coalition of the term was formed, by the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance, with [[Hanna Birna Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir]] becoming mayor.\n\nThe [[2010 Icelandic municipal elections|City Council election in May 2010]] saw a new political party, [[Besti flokkurinn|The Best Party]], win six of 15 seats, and they formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance; comedian [[J\u00f3n Gnarr]] became mayor.<ref name=best>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10194757.stm | title = Best Party wins polls in Iceland's Reykjav\u00edk | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | date = 2010-05-30 | work = [[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> At the 2014 election, the Social Democratic Alliance had its best showing yet, gaining five seats in the council, while [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]] (successor to the Best Party) received two seats and the two parties formed a coalition with the [[Left-Green movement]] and the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], which won one seat each. The Independence Party had its worst election ever, with only four seats.\n\n===Mayor===\n{{Main|Mayor of Reykjav\u00edk City}}\n\nThe mayor is appointed by the city council; usually one of the council members is chosen, but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council.\n\nThe post was created in 1907 and advertised in 1908. Two applications were received, from [[P\u00e1ll Einarsson]], sheriff and town mayor of [[Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]] and from [[Knud Zimsen]], town councillor in Reykjav\u00edk. P\u00e1ll was appointed on 7 May and was mayor for six years. At that time the city mayor received a salary of 4,500 ISK per year and 1,500 ISK for office expenses. The current mayor is [[Dagur B. Eggertsson]].<ref>[http://grapevine.is/news/2014/06/17/jon-gnarr-is-no-longer-mayor-of-reykjavik/ J\u00f3n Glarr is no longer mayor of Reykjav\u00edk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182538/http://grapevine.is/news/2014/06/17/jon-gnarr-is-no-longer-mayor-of-reykjavik/ |date=2016-03-23 }}.

Several multi-lane highways (mainly [[dual carriageway]]s) run between the most heavily populated areas and most frequently driven routes. Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas. Public transportation consists of a bus system called [[Str\u00e6t\u00f3 bs]]. [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the Ring Road) runs through the city outskirts and connects the city to the rest of Iceland.\n\n===Airports and seaports===\n[[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]], the second largest airport in the country (after [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]]), is positioned inside the city, just south of the city centre. It is mainly used for domestic flights, as well as flights to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Since 1962, there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport, since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nReykjav\u00edk has two [[seaport]]s, the old harbour near the city centre which is mainly used by [[fisheries|fishermen]] and [[cruise ship]]s, and ''Sundah\u00f6fn'' in the east city which is the largest [[cargo]] port in the country.\n[[File:Reykjav\u00edk Old Harbor.jpg|thumb|Old Harbour]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:RHR-Minor.JPG|thumb|right|Two steam locomotives were used to build the harbour [[Rail transport in Iceland|Reykjav\u00edk Docks railway]]; both are now on display in Reykjav\u00edk]]\n\nThere are no public railways in Iceland, because of its sparse population, but the locomotives used to build the docks are on display.

Until the 19th century, there was no [[urban development]] in the city location.

Ing\u00f3lfur is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional Norse method: he cast his [[high seat pillars]] (\u00d6ndvegiss\u00falur) into the ocean when he saw the coastline, then settled where the pillars came to shore. This story is widely regarded as a legend; it appears likely that he settled near the hot springs to keep warm in the winter and would not have decided the location by happenstance. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the pillars drifted to that location from where they were said to have been thrown from the boat. Nevertheless, that is what the ''Landnamabok'' says, and it says furthermore that Ing\u00f3lfur's pillars are still to be found in a house in the town.\n\nSteam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjav\u00edk's name, which loosely translates to Smoke Cove (the city is sometimes referred to as ''Bay of Smoke'' or ''Smoky Bay'' in English language travel guides).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1 |title=Google.com |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014024/http://www.google.com/search?q=reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 |archive-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1&gws_rd=cr#tbm=bks&q=Reykjavik+%22smoky+bay%22 |title=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> In the modern language, as in English, the word for 'smoke' and the word for fog or steamy vapour are not commonly confused, but this is believed to have been the case in the old language.\nThe original name was Reykja'''r'''v\u00edk (with an additional \"r\" representing the usual genitive ending of strong nouns) but this had vanished around 1800.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 Er eitthvert \u00f6rnefni \u00e1 h\u00f6fu\u00f0borgarsv\u00e6\u00f0inu e\u00f0a v\u00edk e\u00f0a vogur, sem heitir Reykjav\u00edk?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112309/https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 |date=2017-11-07 }}.

In 1752, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederik V of Denmark]] donated the estate of Reykjav\u00edk to the [[Innr\u00e9ttingar Corporation]]; the name comes from the [[Danish language|Danish-language]] word ''indretninger'', meaning institution. The leader of this movement was {{Interlanguage link multi|Sk\u00fali Magn\u00fasson|is}}. In the 1750s, several houses were built to house the [[wool]] industry, which was Reykjav\u00edk's most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence. Other industries were undertaken by the Innr\u00e9ttingar, such as [[fishing|fisheries]], [[sulfur|sulphur mining]], agriculture, and shipbuilding.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 Hva\u00f0an kemur nafni\u00f0 \"Innr\u00e9ttingarnar\" \u00e1 fyrirt\u00e6kinu sem starfa\u00f0i h\u00e9r \u00e1 \u00e1 18. \u00f6ld?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910092150/http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 |date=2016-09-10 }}. V\u00edsindavefur. (in Icelandic)</ref>\n\nThe Danish Crown abolished monopoly trading in 1786 and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter. Reykjav\u00edk was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently. 1786 is thus regarded as the date of the city's founding. Trading rights were limited to subjects of the Danish Crown, and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland. Over the following decades, their business in Iceland expanded. After 1880, [[free trade]] was expanded to all nationalities, and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow.\n\n===Rise of nationalism===\n[[File:Pg107 Main street of Reykjavik and Governors house.jpg|thumb|Reykjav\u00edk in 1881]]\n\n[[Icelandic nationalism|Icelandic nationalist]] sentiment gained influence in the 19th century, and the idea of Icelandic independence became widespread. Reykjav\u00edk, as Iceland's only city, was central to such ideas. Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjav\u00edk was fundamental to that objective. All the important events in the history of the independence struggle were important to Reykjav\u00edk as well. In 1845 [[Althing|Al\u00feingi]], the general assembly formed in 930 AD, was re-established in Reykjav\u00edk; it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at [[\u00deingvellir]]. At the time it functioned only as an advisory assembly, advising the king about Icelandic affairs. The location of Al\u00feingi in Reykjav\u00edk effectively established the city as the capital of Iceland.\n\nIn 1874, Iceland was given a constitution; with it, Al\u00feingi gained some limited legislative powers and in essence became the institution that it is today. The next step was to move most of the executive power to Iceland: [[Home rule|Home Rule]] was granted in 1904 when the office of [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Minister For Iceland]] was established in Reykjav\u00edk. The biggest step towards an independent Iceland was taken on 1 December 1918 when Iceland became a sovereign country under the [[List of Danish monarchs|Crown of Denmark]], the [[Kingdom of Iceland]].\n\nBy the 1920s and 1930s most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjav\u00edk; [[cod]] production was its main industry, but the [[Great Depression]] hit Reykjav\u00edk hard with unemployment, and labour union struggles sometimes became violent.\n\n===World War II===\nOn the morning of 10 May 1940, following the German occupation of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] on 9 April 1940, four British warships approached Reykjav\u00edk and anchored in the harbour. In a few hours, the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Invasion of Iceland|occupation of Reykjav\u00edk]] was complete. There was no armed resistance, and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force, which initially had no motor vehicles. The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government to consent to the occupation, but it always declined on the basis of the [[Neutral country|Neutrality Policy]]. For the remaining years of [[World War II]], British and later American soldiers occupied camps in Reykjav\u00edk, and the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjav\u00edk became about the same as the local population of the city. [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] formed part of the garrison in Iceland during the early part of the war.\n\nThe economic effects of the occupation were positive for Reykjav\u00edk: the unemployment of the Depression years vanished, and construction work began. The British built [[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]], which is still in service today, mostly for short haul flights (to domestic destinations and Greenland). The Americans, meanwhile, built [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport|Keflav\u00edk Airport]], situated {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Reykjav\u00edk, which became Iceland's primary international airport. In 1944, the Republic of Iceland was founded and a [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]], elected by the people, replaced the king; the office of the president was placed in Reykjav\u00edk.\n\n===Post-war development===\nIn the post-war years, the growth of Reykjav\u00edk accelerated. An exodus from the rural countryside began, largely because improved technology in agriculture reduced the need for manpower, and because of a population boom resulting from better living conditions in the country. A once-primitive village was rapidly transformed into a modern city. Private cars became common, and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs.\n\nIn 1972, Reykjav\u00edk hosted the [[World Chess Championship 1972|world chess championship]] between [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]]. The 1986 [[Reykjav\u00edk Summit]] between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underlined Reykjav\u00edk's international status. [[Deregulation]] in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s again transformed Reykjav\u00edk. The financial and IT sectors are now significant employers in the city. The city has fostered some world-famous talents in recent decades, such as [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[\u00d3lafur Arnalds]] and bands [[M\u00fam]], [[Sigur R\u00f3s]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], poet [[Sj\u00f3n]] and visual artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Reykjavikfromabove.jpg|thumb|Reykjav\u00edk seen from above]]\n[[File:Reykjavik Esja.jpg|thumb|[[Esjan|Esja]], the mountain range to the north of Reykjav\u00edk]]\n\nReykjav\u00edk is located in the southwest of [[Iceland]]. The Reykjav\u00edk area coastline is characterized by peninsulas, coves, straits, and islands.\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]] (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered parts of the city area, reaching as far out as [[\u00c1lftanes]]. Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water. In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age, some hills like \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0 were islands. The former sea level is indicated by sediments (with clams) reaching (at \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0, for example) as far as {{convert|43|m|0|abbr=on}} above the current sea level. The hills of \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0 and Sk\u00f3lav\u00f6r\u00f0uholt appear to be the remains of former [[shield volcanoes]] which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away, and began to look as it does today.\n\nThe capital city area continued to be shaped by earthquakes and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], like the one 4,500 years ago in the mountain range Bl\u00e1fj\u00f6ll, when the lava coming down the Elli\u00f0a\u00e1 valley reached the sea at the bay of Elli\u00f0avogur.\n\nThe largest river to run through Reykjav\u00edk is the [[Elli\u00f0a\u00e1r|Elli\u00f0a\u00e1]] River, which is non-navigable. It is one of the best [[salmon]] fishing rivers in the country. Mount [[Esja]], at {{convert|914|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nThe city of Reykjav\u00edk is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east. Reykjav\u00edk is a spread-out city: most of its urban area consists of low-density suburbs, and houses are usually widely spaced. The outer residential neighbourhoods are also widely spaced from each other; in between them are the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty space. The city's latitude is 64\u00b008' N, making it the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost capital]] of a sovereign state ([[Nuuk]], the capital of [[Greenland]], is slightly further north at 64\u00b010', but Greenland is a [[Denmark#Greenland and the Faroe Islands|constituent country]], not an independent state).\n\n{{wide image|Reykjavik_Perlan.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Reykjav\u00edk seen from [[Perlan]] with the mountains Akrafjall (middle) and [[Esjan|Esja]] (right) in the background}}\n{{wide image|Vista de Reikiavik desde Perlan, Distrito de la Capital, Islandia, 2014-08-13, DD 134-145 HDR PAN.JPG|1200px|Panorama of Reykjav\u00edk seen from [[Perlan]] at sunset in summer.

From 20 May to 24 July, daylight is essentially permanent as the sun never gets more than 5\u00b0 below the horizon. Day length drops to less than five hours between 2 December and 10 January. The sun climbs just 3\u00b0 above the horizon during this time. However, day length begins increasing rapidly during January and by month's end there are seven hours of daylight.\n\nDespite its northern latitude, temperatures very rarely drop below {{convert|-15|C|0}} in the winter. The proximity to the [[Arctic Circle]] and the strong moderation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the [[Iceland]]ic coast (influence of [[North Atlantic Current]], an extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]) shape a relatively mild winter and cool summer. The city's coastal location does make it prone to wind, however, and [[gale]]s are common in winter.&nbsp;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Summers are cool, with temperatures fluctuating between {{convert|10|and|15|C}}, rarely exceeding {{convert|20|C|0}}.

The council has 23 members who are elected using the [[open list]] method for four-year terms.\n\nThe council selects members of boards, and each board controls a different field under the city council's authority. The most important board is the City Board that wields the executive rights along with the City Mayor. The City Mayor is the senior public official and also the director of city operations. Other public officials control city institutions under the mayor's authority. Thus, the administration consists of two different parts:\n*The political power of City Council cascading down to other boards\n*Public officials under the authority of the city mayor who administer and manage implementation of policy.\n\n===Political control===\nThe [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] was historically the city's ruling party; it had an overall majority from its establishment in 1929 until 1978, when it narrowly lost. From 1978 until 1982, there was a three-party coalition composed of the [[People's Alliance (Iceland)|People's Alliance]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. In 1982, the Independence Party regained an overall majority, which it held for three consecutive terms. The 1994 election was won by [[Reykjav\u00edkurlistinn]] (the R-list), an alliance of Icelandic socialist parties, led by [[Ingibj\u00f6rg S\u00f3lr\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir]]. This alliance won a majority in three consecutive elections, but was dissolved for the 2006 election when five different parties were on the ballot. The Independence Party won seven seats, and together with the one Progressive Party they were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006.\n\nIn October 2007 a new majority was formed on the council, consisting of members of the Progressive Party, the [[Social Democratic Alliance]], the [[Left-Green Movement|Left-Greens]] and the F-list (liberals and independents), after controversy regarding REI, a subsidiary of OR, the city's energy company. However, three months later the F-list formed a new majority together with the Independence Party. [[\u00d3lafur Fri\u00f0rik Magn\u00fasson|\u00d3lafur F. Magn\u00fasson]], the leader of the F-list, was elected mayor on 24 January 2008, and in March 2009 the Independence Party was due to appoint a new mayor. This changed once again on 14 August 2008 when the fourth coalition of the term was formed, by the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance, with [[Hanna Birna Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir]] becoming mayor.\n\nThe [[2010 Icelandic municipal elections|City Council election in May 2010]] saw a new political party, [[Besti flokkurinn|The Best Party]], win six of 15 seats, and they formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance; comedian [[J\u00f3n Gnarr]] became mayor.<ref name=best>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10194757.stm | title = Best Party wins polls in Iceland's Reykjav\u00edk | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | date = 2010-05-30 | work = [[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> At the 2014 election, the Social Democratic Alliance had its best showing yet, gaining five seats in the council, while [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]] (successor to the Best Party) received two seats and the two parties formed a coalition with the [[Left-Green movement]] and the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], which won one seat each. The Independence Party had its worst election ever, with only four seats.\n\n===Mayor===\n{{Main|Mayor of Reykjav\u00edk City}}\n\nThe mayor is appointed by the city council; usually one of the council members is chosen, but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council.\n\nThe post was created in 1907 and advertised in 1908. Two applications were received, from [[P\u00e1ll Einarsson]], sheriff and town mayor of [[Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]] and from [[Knud Zimsen]], town councillor in Reykjav\u00edk. P\u00e1ll was appointed on 7 May and was mayor for six years. At that time the city mayor received a salary of 4,500 ISK per year and 1,500 ISK for office expenses. The current mayor is [[Dagur B.

Many of these projects came to a screeching halt in the following [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|economic crash of 2008]].\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Roads===\nPer capita [[Automobile|car]] ownership in Iceland is among the highest in the world at roughly 522 vehicles per 1,000 residents,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| publisher=nationmaster.com| work=United Nations World Statistics Pocketbook| title=Motor vehicles (most recent) by country| accessdate=2010-03-29| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327112758/http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| archive-date=2010-03-27| url-status=live}}</ref> though Reykjav\u00edk is not severely affected by [[Traffic congestion|congestion]]. Several multi-lane highways (mainly [[dual carriageway]]s) run between the most heavily populated areas and most frequently driven routes. Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas. Public transportation consists of a bus system called [[Str\u00e6t\u00f3 bs]]. [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the Ring Road) runs through the city outskirts and connects the city to the rest of Iceland.\n\n===Airports and seaports===\n[[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]], the second largest airport in the country (after [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]]), is positioned inside the city, just south of the city centre. It is mainly used for domestic flights, as well as flights to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Since 1962, there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport, since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nReykjav\u00edk has two [[seaport]]s, the old harbour near the city centre which is mainly used by [[fisheries|fishermen]] and [[cruise ship]]s, and ''Sundah\u00f6fn'' in the east city which is the largest [[cargo]] port in the country.\n[[File:Reykjav\u00edk Old Harbor.jpg|thumb|Old Harbour]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:RHR-Minor.JPG|thumb|right|Two steam locomotives were used to build the harbour [[Rail transport in Iceland|Reykjav\u00edk Docks railway]]; both are now on display in Reykjav\u00edk]]\n\nThere are no public railways in Iceland, because of its sparse population, but the locomotives used to build the docks are on display.

This festival takes place all over the city, and the concert venue [[Harpa (concert hall)|Harpa]] is one of the main locations.

His work is a unique and fearless marriage of politics and art. I take my hat off to him.\"\n\n==Early life==\nFreed was born May 13, 1932 in Chicago, Illinois, the only son of Jeanne Greene and David J. Freed, an attorney; the couple later divorced. Freed maintained a relationship with his biological father throughout his life. His mother remarried Arthur Malson, a merchant by trade.  At age 4, Freed moved with his mother and stepfather to Eagle River, Wisconsin. Three years later, Freed\u2019s mother and stepfather moved again, to [[Alexandria, Louisiana]],<ref>(Johnson, Mikulan)</ref> The family expanded; Freed is the eldest of his four half-siblings Lynnel Hope, Anne, Paulette, and Byron.

Special Studies included Aesthetics with Professor Leon Katz, and Psychoanalytic Studies in Literature with Lawrence J. Friedman, M.D. and Milton Lester, M.D.\n\nIn 1952, at 20, he married Patricia McGowan and the couple moved to Los Angeles, California three years later. They divorced in 1960. In 1965, Freed married actress Barboura Morris. In 1975, the couple adopted Hugh Morris Freed, but Barboura died later that year.

According to Freed's friend and colleague, the late Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter, \"(Freed) is a writer of blazing imagination, courage and insight. His work is a unique and fearless marriage of politics and art. I take my hat off to him.\"\n\n==Early life==\nFreed was born May 13, 1932 in Chicago, Illinois, the only son of Jeanne Greene and David J. Freed, an attorney; the couple later divorced. Freed maintained a relationship with his biological father throughout his life. His mother remarried Arthur Malson, a merchant by trade.  At age 4, Freed moved with his mother and stepfather to Eagle River, Wisconsin. Three years later, Freed\u2019s mother and stepfather moved again, to [[Alexandria, Louisiana]],<ref>(Johnson, Mikulan)</ref> The family expanded; Freed is the eldest of his four half-siblings Lynnel Hope, Anne, Paulette, and Byron. From 1939-1949, he was educated at West End Grammar School, Bolton High School, St. John\u2019s Military Academy in Delafield, WI, and Louisiana College.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/countermythologist/|title=Countermythologist|last=Mikulan|first=Steven|date=May 30, 2001|website=LA Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMalson, Freed's stepfather, was \"a successful merchant selling clothing for a time, then military gear, and later soft drinks. After World War II, when the wartime boom deflated and prices soared, his stepfather\u2019s business collapsed and he committed suicide\".<ref name=\"Johnson\">(Johnson)</ref> \"&nbsp;'We\u2019ve all known a [[Willy Loman]] in our life,' Freed said, referring to [[Arthur Miller]]'s classic play, '[[Death of a Salesman]],' [emended] in which the protagonist Willy Loman commits suicide hoping that in death he may provide for his family. Freed's mother, who sold insurance 'in the back roads of Louisiana,' supported the family until she died of cancer at 42\".<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nFreed\u2019s higher education began in 1949 at the University of Illinois; in 1950 continued at the Goodman school of theater in Chicago. Upon moving to Los Angeles, he attended California State University at Northridge and University of California Los Angeles. Special Studies included Aesthetics with Professor Leon Katz, and Psychoanalytic Studies in Literature with Lawrence J. Friedman, M.D. and Milton Lester, M.D.\n\nIn 1952, at 20, he married Patricia McGowan and the couple moved to Los Angeles, California three years later. They divorced in 1960. In 1965, Freed married actress Barboura Morris. In 1975, the couple adopted Hugh Morris Freed, but Barboura died later that year. In 1980, he married Patricia Rae Ezor, and after 40 years they remain so.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe and his wife Patricia Rae Freed, a former teacher who represents him, live in Los Angeles.<ref>(Johnson, Mikulan, ''Another America'')</ref> After his visiting appointment in Leeds and York, they returned to [[University of Southern California|USC]], where he has taught in the United States' first multidisciplinary master's program in creative writing for 22 years\".<ref>(\"Author Biography\")</ref>\n\n== Work for the Peoples Temple and Jonestown Tragedy ==\nFreed visited [[Jonestown]] before the [[mass suicide]] of over 900 members of the [[Peoples Temple]].

Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.\n\nThe earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the ''[[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]]; [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Vritra|V\u1e5btra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]''; the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; [[Big Ghoul|Grand'Goule]] in the Poitou region in [[France]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]]; [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], [[N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]]; and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.\n\nThe popular western image of a dragon is based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].\n\nThe word \"dragon\" has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional \u9f8d, simplified \u9f99, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.\n\nCommonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of avian, feline, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating [[crocodile]]s bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-did-dragons-come-from-23969126/|title=Where Did Dragons Come From?|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|date=January 23, 2012|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/english/200004/29/eng20000429_40001.html|title=Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon|date=April 29, 2000|website=People's Daily}}</ref> This also fits with the ancient words 'Draco' and 'Drakon', meaning 'large serpent' or 'sea serpent.'\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T.

Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166\u2013168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in \"dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests\", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}\n\nIn her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman

animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii\u2013xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by \"observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as \"dragon bones\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long \"been considered barren of large fossils.\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that \"Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations

entertainment.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} During the [[Dragon Boat Festival|Duanwu]] festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a [[Dragon boat|dragon boat race]], in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet [[Qu Yuan]] committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]] and people raced out in boats hoping to save him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] gradually became closely identified with dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnation of a divine dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the

Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (\uc5ec\uc758\uc8fc), the Korean name for the mythical [[Cintamani]], in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9\u00d79) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (\uc6a9\uc655), are common in Korean folklore.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hayward | first = Philip| title= Scaled for Success: The Internationalisation of the Mermaid | year = 2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0861967322|url= |page= }}</ref>\n\nIn Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. [[Lady Aryeong]], who was the first queen of [[Silla]] is said to have been born from a [[cockatrice]],<ref>[[Samguk yusa]]</ref> while the grandmother of [[Taejo of Goryeo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea.<ref>The book of the genealogy of [[Taejo of Goryeo]] - ''Pyeonnyeon-Tong-Long'' (\ud3b8\ub144\ud1b5\ub85d)</ref> And [[Munmu of Silla|King Munmu]] of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (\uc6a9\ud3ec). In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.<ref>{{cite book| title=\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc637 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 | year = 2004|publisher=Sungshin Women's University Press|isbn=978-8986092639|url= |pages=25\u201326 }}</ref>\n\nKorean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally [[:ko:\uc774\ubb34\uae30|Imugis]] (\uc774\ubb34\uae30), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, ''yong'' or ''mireu'', if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a ''proto-dragon'' which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, [[Pythonidae|python]]-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.<ref>{{cite book| last= Seo | first = Yeong Dae| title= \uc6a9, \uadf8 \uc2e0\ud654\uc640 \ubb38\ud654 | year = 2002|publisher=Min sokwon|isbn=978-8956380223|url= |page= 85}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese dragon====\n[[File:Hokusai Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting of a Japanese dragon by [[Hokusai]] ({{circa}} 1730 \u2013 1849)]]\n{{Main|Japanese dragon}}\nJapanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India.

cockatrice's mortal enemy.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} A [[basilisk]] is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a [[midden]] by a nine-year-old cockatrice.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}}\n\n===Post-classical Eastern

dragon|Kulshedra}}\n\nIn [[Albanian mythology|Albanian mythology and folklore]], ''[[stihi]]'', ''[[ljubi]]'', ''[[Kulshedra|bolla, bollar, errshaja and kulshedra]]'' are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons. It is believed that ''bolla'', a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes [[metamorphosis]] passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human. The ''bollar'' and ''errshaja'' are the intermediate stages, while the ''kulshedra'' is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind. She is usually fought and defeated by a [[drangue]], a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.{{sfnp|Doja|2005|p=449\u2013462}}{{Sfn|Elsie|2001|pp=46-47, 74-76, 153-156}}\n\nIn [[Slavic mythology]], the words ''\"zmey\"'', ''\"zmiy\"'' or ''\"zmaj\"'' are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for \"snake\", which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043a'', ''\u0446\u043c\u043e\u043a'', or ''smok''. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called ''lamya'' (\u043b\u0430\u043c\u044f, \u043b\u0430\u043cj\u0430, lamja). Although quite similar to other [[European dragon]]s, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.\n\nIn [[Folklore of Russia|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian folklore]], [[Zmey Gorynych]] is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of [[sulfur]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} It was believed that [[eclipse]]s were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the [[tsar]] and imprisoned her in his castle in the [[Ural Mountains]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Then a palace guard in [[Moscow]] named [[Ivan Tsarevich]] overheard two crows talking about the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=147\u2013148}} He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}}\n\nA popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the [[Wawel Dragon]],{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} which is first recorded in the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Chronica Polonorum]]'' of [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], written between 1190 and 1208.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} According to Kad\u0142ubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of [[Krakus|King Krakus]]{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Since they could not slay it by hand,{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself,{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} In the fifteenth century, [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon.{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} Another version of the story told by [[Marcin Bielski]] instead has the clever shoemaker Skub\u0119 come up with the idea for slaying the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Ro\u017cek|1988|page=27}} Bielski's version is now the most popular.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}\n\n==Modern depictions==\n{{see also|List of dragons in popular culture#Dragons in fiction|label 1=List of dragons in fiction}}\n\n[[File:Smaug par David Demaret.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern [[Fan art|fan illustration]] by David Demaret of the dragon [[Smaug]] from [[J.

Sandra Martina Schwab writes, \"With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles.

Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.\n\nThe earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the ''[[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]]; [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Vritra|V\u1e5btra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]''; the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; [[Big Ghoul|Grand'Goule]] in the Poitou region in [[France]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]]; [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], [[N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]]; and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.\n\nThe popular western image of a dragon is based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].\n\nThe word \"dragon\" has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional \u9f8d, simplified \u9f99, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.\n\nCommonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of avian, feline, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating [[crocodile]]s bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-did-dragons-come-from-23969126/|title=Where Did Dragons Come From?|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|date=January 23, 2012|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/english/200004/29/eng20000429_40001.html|title=Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon|date=April 29, 2000|website=People's Daily}}</ref> This also fits with the ancient words 'Draco' and 'Drakon', meaning 'large serpent' or 'sea serpent.'\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T.

Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166\u2013168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in \"dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests\", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}\n\nIn her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times'' (2000), [[Adrienne Mayor]] argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii\u2013xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by \"observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as \"dragon bones\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long \"been considered barren of large fossils.\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that \"Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as [[Komodo dragon]]s, [[Gila monster]]s, [[iguana]]s, [[alligator]]s, or, in California, [[Elgaria|alligator lizards]].\"{{sfn|Mayor|2005|page=149}}\n\n==Africa==\n====Egypt====\n[[File:Set speared Apep.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from an ancient Egyptian papyrus manuscript showing the god [[Set

[[flint]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep's roar{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} and [[solar eclipse]]s were thought to be the result of Apep

guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the [[Pyramid Texts]] whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the

[[ouroboros]] was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The precursor to the ouroboros was the \"Many-Faced\",{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} a serpent with five heads, who, according to the [[Amduat]], the oldest surviving [[Book of the Dead|Book of the Afterlife]], was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The earliest surviving depiction of a \"true\" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in [[KV62|the tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]].{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christians{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} and chapter 136 of the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', an early Gnostic text, describes \"a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth\".{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century [[Codex Marcianus CCXXVIII (406)|Codex Marcianus]] was copied in numerous works on

dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} Although stories of the [[Dragon King]]s are among the most popular dragon stories in China today, these stories did not begin to emerge until the [[Eastern Han]], when Buddhist stories of the serpent rain-god [[N\u0101ga]] became popular.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} [[Taoism|Taoists]] began to invent their own dragon kings and eventually such stories developed in every major Chinese religion.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} According to these stories, every body of water is ruled by a dragon king, each with a different power, rank, and ability,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=108}} so people began establishing temples across the countryside dedicated to these

dance]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but now it is done mostly only for entertainment.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} During the [[Dragon Boat Festival|Duanwu]] festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a [[Dragon boat|dragon boat race]], in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet [[Qu Yuan]] committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]] and people raced out in boats hoping to save him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] gradually became closely identified with dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnation of a divine dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon were ordered to be executed.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} After the

It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (\uc5ec\uc758\uc8fc), the Korean name for the mythical [[Cintamani]], in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9\u00d79) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (\uc6a9\uc655), are common in Korean folklore.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hayward | first = Philip| title= Scaled for Success: The Internationalisation of the Mermaid | year = 2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0861967322|url= |page= }}</ref>\n\nIn Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. [[Lady Aryeong]], who was the first queen of [[Silla]] is said to have been born from a [[cockatrice]],<ref>[[Samguk yusa]]</ref> while the grandmother of [[Taejo of Goryeo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea.<ref>The book of the genealogy of [[Taejo of Goryeo]] - ''Pyeonnyeon-Tong-Long'' (\ud3b8\ub144\ud1b5\ub85d)</ref> And [[Munmu of Silla|King Munmu]] of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (\uc6a9\ud3ec). In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.<ref>{{cite book| title=\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc637 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 | year = 2004|publisher=Sungshin Women's University Press|isbn=978-8986092639|url= |pages=25\u201326 }}</ref>\n\nKorean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally [[:ko:\uc774\ubb34\uae30|Imugis]] (\uc774\ubb34\uae30), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, ''yong'' or ''mireu'', if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a ''proto-dragon'' which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, [[Pythonidae|python]]-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.<ref>{{cite book| last= Seo | first = Yeong Dae| title= \uc6a9, \uadf8 \uc2e0\ud654\uc640 \ubb38\ud654 | year = 2002|publisher=Min sokwon|isbn=978-8956380223|url= |page= 85}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese dragon====\n[[File:Hokusai Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting of a Japanese dragon by [[Hokusai]] ({{circa}} 1730 \u2013 1849)]]\n{{Main|Japanese dragon}}\nJapanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India.

As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon. Rakhsh bites the serpent, while Rostam decapitates it.

In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the \"Orient\" (either India or China depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades. The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the ''babr-e bay\u0101n''. In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed [[Rakhsh]]. On reviving, he washes himself in a spring. In the [[Mandaeism|Mandean]] tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon and kills it from inside its belly.

The ''bollar'' and ''errshaja'' are the intermediate stages, while the ''kulshedra'' is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind. She is usually fought and defeated by a [[drangue]], a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans.

These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for \"snake\", which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043a'', ''\u0446\u043c\u043e\u043a'', or ''smok''.

Sandra Martina Schwab writes, \"With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction.

[[John T.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department, pages 411\u2013424]</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.
