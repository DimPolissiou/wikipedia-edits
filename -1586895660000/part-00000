In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March&nbsp;22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May&nbsp;30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March&nbsp;11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nTo ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2 each. Dealers were unable to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} leading them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G.

Harding]] charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion. She recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design,{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} and said that \"his models were 'unsatisfactory' and 'lack artistic merit'.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/ |title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar |website=earlycommemorativecoins.com |url-status=live |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced [[medalist]].{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia's and Clemson's talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, saying she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965.

It was instead used for some kerosene lamps and stoves. He later improved upon the pump by adding safety measures, and also by adding a hose to directly dispense fuel into automobiles. For a while, the term ''bowser'' was used to refer to a vertical gasoline pump.  Although the term is not used anymore in the [[United States]], except as a term for trucks that carry and dispense fuel to large aircraft at airports, it still is used sometimes in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe first fuel dispenser was patented by Norwegian John J. Tokheim in 1901. The Tokheim pump was named for him. Fuel retail industry giant OPW (a Dover company) acquired Tokheim in 2016.\n\nMany early gasoline pumps had a calibrated glass cylinder on top.  The desired quantity of fuel was pumped up into the cylinder as indicated by the calibration. Then the pumping was stopped and the gasoline was let out into the customer's tank by gravity.  When metering pumps came into use, a small glass globe with a turbine inside replaced the measuring cylinder, but assured the customer that gasoline really was flowing into the tank.\n\nIn the United States, federal requirements to upgrade pumps resulted in some stations improving the pumping experience for customers by adding news, weather, entertainment and commercials on TV screens in the pumps. Advertising on the pumps might include the station where the pump is located, and even the capability to print out coupons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/don-t-touch-that-dial-watch-tv-while-you-re/article_935c2714-84be-5184-bf7a-a45786fe7e9d.html|title=Don't touch that dial: Watch TV while you're pumping gas|last=Tighe|first=Mike|work=[[La Crosse Tribune]]|date=2015-02-25|accessdate=2019-11-11}}</ref> As of 2014, the company Gas Station TV had increased its number of stations from five in Texas eight years earlier to 2,600, reaching an estimated 50 million people.

In general, submersible solutions in Europe are installed in hotter countries, where suction pumps may have problems overcoming [[cavitation]] with warm fuels or when the distance from tank to pump is longer than a suction pump can manage.\n\nIn modern pumps, the major variations are in the number of hoses or grades they can dispense, the physical shape, and the addition of extra devices such as [[pay at the pump]] devices and attendant \"tag\" readers.\n\nLight passenger vehicle pump flow rate ranges up to about {{convert|50|l|USgal|abbr=off|lk=on}} per minute<ref name=ukcert>{{cite web |title=Certificate Pursuant to section 12 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296219/UK-2780-revision-3.pdf}}</ref> (the [[United States]] limits this to {{convert|10|USgal|l|abbr=off}} per minute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oms/regs/ld-hwy/evap/spitback.txt |title=The EPA 10 gallon per minute fuel dispensing limit |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=1997-09-24 |accessdate=2016-04-20}}</ref>); pumps serving trucks and other large vehicles have a higher flow rate, up to {{convert|130|l|USgal|abbr=off}} per minute in the UK,<ref name=ukcert/> and airline refueling can reach {{convert|1000|USgal|l|abbr=off}} per minute.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Large Aircraft Fuel Up |last=Austerman |first=Gary |date=May 1997 |publisher=Petroleum Equipment & Technology Archive |url=http://www.petrolplaza.com/technology/articles/MiZlbiYxMDIxMyYmMSYyJiY%3D}}</ref> Higher flow rates may overload the vapor recovery system in vehicles equipped with enhanced evaporative emissions controls<ref>{{cite web |title=California Refueling Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1998 Through 2000 Model Motor Vehicles |date=August 5, 1999 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/evap/orvr00.pdf}}</ref> (required since 1996 in the US), causing excess vapor emissions, and may present a safety hazard.\n\nHistorically, fuel dispensers had a very wide range of designs to solve the mechanical problems of mechanical pumping, reliable measurement, safety, and aesthetics. This has led to some popularity in collecting antique dispensers, especially in the USA.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/automobiles/collectibles/05PETRO.html?fta=y | work=The New York Times | title=Filling Up the Backyard With a Gas Station | first=Dave | last=Caldwell | date=October 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Fuel nozzles ===\nNozzles are attached to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's filling inlet. The hoses are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler.\n\nThe nozzles are usually color-coded to indicate which grade of fuel they dispense, however, the color-coding differs between countries or even retailers. For example, a black hose and handle in the UK indicate that the fuel dispensed is diesel, and a green dispenser indicates unleaded fuel; the reverse is common in the US.\n\nSome different types of fuel have specially sized nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps is supposed to be larger so that it cannot fit into the filler pipe on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles.  Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [[wikt:misfueling|misfueling]]. Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.\n\n=== Blending ===\nIn some countries, pumps are able to mix two fuel products together before dispensing; this is referred to as blending or mixing. Typical usages are in a \"mix\" pump to add oil to petrol for [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] [[motorcycle]]s, to produce an intermediate [[octane rating]] from separate high and low octane fuels, or to blend [[hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] ([[HCNG]]).  The benefit of blending for retailers is that it allows them to offer 3 grades of fuel while only having to maintain inventory of two grades.  This frees up both working capital and tank capacity and improves fuel turnover.\n\n[[File:Gas pump display, Jacksonville, FL.jpg|thumbnail|right|A pump display in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]]]\n\n=== Flow measurement ===\nOne of the most important functions for the pump is to accurately measure the amount of fuel pumped. [[Flow measurement]] is almost always done by a 4 stroke piston meter connected to an electronic encoder.<ref name=ukcert/> In older gas pumps, the meter is physically coupled to reeled numerical displays (moving wheels or cylinders with numbers on the side), while newer pumps turn the meter's movement into electrical pulses using a [[rotary encoder]].  In the U.S. flow speed is limited to 10 gallons per minute for cars and 40 gallons per minute for trucks.  This flow rate is based on the diameter of the vehicle's fuel filling pipe, which limits flow to these amounts.\n\n=== The metrology of gasoline ===\nGasoline is difficult to sell in a fair and consistent manner by volumetric units. It expands and contracts significantly as its temperature changes. A comparison of the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] for gasoline and liquid water at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C indicates that the volume of gasoline changes at about 4.5 times the rate of water.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) specifies the accuracy of the measurements in Handbook 44,<ref name=hb44>{{cite web |title=Handbook 44 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/hb44.cfm}}</ref> though states set their own legal standards. The standard accuracy is 0.3%, meaning that a {{convert|10|usgal|L|1|adj=on}} purchase may actually deliver {{convert|9.97|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10.03|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe reference temperature for gasoline volume measurement is 60&nbsp;\u00b0F or 15&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=sta/> Ten gallons of gasoline at that temperature expands to about {{convert|10.15|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|85|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and contracts to about {{convert|9.83|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|30|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Each of the three volumes represents the same theoretical amount of energy. In one sense, ten gallons of gasoline purchased at 30&nbsp;\u00b0F is about 3.2% more potential energy than ten gallons purchased at 85&nbsp;\u00b0F. Most gasoline is stored in tanks underneath the [[filling station]]. Modern tanks are non-metallic and sealed to stop leaks. Some have double walls or other structures that provide inadvertent thermal insulation while pursuing the main goal of keeping gasoline out of the soil around the tank. The net result is that while the air temperature can easily vary between {{convert|30|and|85|\u00b0F|}}, the gasoline in the insulated tank changes temperature much more slowly, especially in underground tanks, as deep soil temperature tends to remain in a narrow range throughout the year, regardless of air temperature.\n\nTemperature compensation is common at the wholesale transaction level in the United States and most other countries. At the retail consumer level, Canada has converted to automatic temperature compensation, and the UK is undergoing conversion, but the United States has not. Automatic temperature compensation, known as Standard Temperature Accounting in the UK, may add a tiny amount of additional uncertainty to the measurement, about 0.1%.<ref name=sta>{{cite web |title=STA Guidance |date=Feb 2016 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504706/STA_Guidance_Feb_2016_version_11.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere are far fewer retail outlets for gasoline in the United States today than there were in 1980. Larger outlets sell gasoline rapidly, as much as {{convert|30000|usgal|L|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in a single day, even in remote places. Most finished product gasoline is delivered in 8,000- to 16,000-gallon [[tank trucks]], so two deliveries in a 24-hour period is common. The belief is that the gasoline spends so little time in the retail sales system that its temperature at the point of sale does not vary significantly from winter to summer or by region. Canada has lower overall population densities and geographically larger gasoline distribution systems, compared with the United States. Temperature compensation at the retail level improves the fairness under those conditions.\n\nIn the United States, each of the 50 states has a Department of Weights and Measure, with the authority to perform all testing and certification, issuing fines for non-compliance. For example, in 2007 Arizona found that 9% of all pumps were at off by at least 2.5% (the threshold for fines), evenly split between overcounting and undercounting fuel.<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/07/01/20080701biz-gaspumps0630.html?nclick_check=1</ref>\n[[File:Florida Department of Agriculture Petroleum Inspection (cropped).jpg|thumb|A state petroleum inspector visiting a [[Mobil]] station in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]]]]\n\nIn some regions, regular required inspections are conducted to ensure the accuracy of fuel dispensers. For example, in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] conducts regular tests of calibration and fuel quality at individual dispensers. The department also conducts random undercover inspections using specially designed vehicles that can check the accuracy of the dispensers. The department issues correction required notices to stations with pumps found to be inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/standard/petro/index.html|title=Bureau of Petroleum Inspection|accessdate=2011-12-10|publisher=Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202102912/http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/standard/petro/index.html|archive-date=2010-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most other US states conduct similar inspections. In Canada, inspections are regularly conducted by the federal government agency [[Measurement Canada]]. Inspection dates and test results are required, by law, to be displayed on a sticker on fuel dispensers for consumers to see. Under a recently proposed legislation by the House of Commons (C-14: Fairness at the Pumps Act), fines for a vendor with a modified fuel dispenser or poorly maintained dispenser would be up to $50,000. However, virtually all pumps that fail inspection in Canada do so for general calibration errors caused by use over time. Intentional modification for the purpose of deceiving consumers is extremely rare.\n\n=== The metrology of hydrogen ===\nThe [[hydrogen fuel]] dispensers<ref>[http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&PAGE=showRelease&RELEASE_ID=2620 SAE International publishes new standard, SAE J2601, to establish worldwide basis for H2 fueling of fuel cell electric vehicles]</ref> in use on [[hydrogen stations]] dispense the fuel by the kilogram.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25413866 LA gas station gets hydrogen fuel pump]</ref> In the United States, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) specifies the accuracy of the measurements in Handbook 44.

Traditionally these variations gave pump manufacturers a natural tie-in for their own point-of-sale systems, since only they understood the protocols.<ref>[http://www.ifsf.org/Software/IFSF%20Management%20Intro%20-%20V3.01.pdf IFSF Management Intro, sec 1.1 Background history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824121152/http://www.ifsf.org/Software/IFSF%20Management%20Intro%20-%20V3.01.pdf |date=August 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nAn effort to standardize this in the 1990s resulted in the [[International Forecourt Standards Forum]], which has had considerable success in Europe, but has less presence elsewhere.  (\"[[Forecourt]]\" refers to the land area on which the fuel dispensers are located.)\n\nBy October 2017, all United States gas pumps had to use [[EMV]] technology for payment. A year before this change was required, a third of 750,000 pumps needed upgrading at a cost of $17,000 plus the cost of hardware and software. With some software not expected to be ready, some [[Fuel card|fleet cards]] not having [[Smart card|chip technology]] available in time, not enough technicians for the installations, and many businesses having a difficult time affording the upgrade, it was predicted the conversion would take until 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-gas-station-chip-card-upgrade-20161031-story.html|title=For gas-station operators, chip card upgrade is a pain in the pump|last=Kharif|first=Olga|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|via=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Automatic cut-off in fuel dispenser ===\nThe shut-off valve was invented in [[Olean, New York]] in 1939 by Richard C. Corson. At a loading dock at the [[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]], Corson observed a worker filling a barrel with gasoline and thought it inefficient. The sound of a toilet flushing later gave him the idea for a \"butterfly float.\" After developing a prototype with his assistant, Paul Wenke, Corson gave the suggestion to the company who later filed for a patent in his name. The initial intent of the device was to \"allow a person to fill more than one barrel [of gasoline] at the same time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents?id=N5VFAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Patent US2316934 - Barrel Filler|publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> This mechanism eventually developed into the modern gasoline pump cut-off valve.<ref>{{cite news| last=Sampson|first=Julia |title=Did you know? Gas Pump shut-off valve was invented in Olean |newspaper=Olean Times Herald |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMost modern pumps have an auto cut-off feature that stops the flow when the tank is full.

It was instead used for some kerosene lamps and stoves. He later improved upon the pump by adding safety measures, and also by adding a hose to directly dispense fuel into automobiles. For a while, the term ''bowser'' was used to refer to a vertical gasoline pump.  Although the term is not used anymore in the [[United States]], except as a term for trucks that carry and dispense fuel to large aircraft at airports, it still is used sometimes in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe first fuel dispenser was patented by Norwegian John J. Tokheim in 1901. The Tokheim pump was named for him. Fuel retail industry giant OPW (a Dover company) acquired Tokheim in 2016.\n\nMany early gasoline pumps had a calibrated glass cylinder on top.  The desired quantity of fuel was pumped up into the cylinder as indicated by the calibration. Then the pumping was stopped and the gasoline was let out into the customer's tank by gravity.  When metering pumps came into use, a small glass globe with a turbine inside replaced the measuring cylinder, but assured the customer that gasoline really was flowing into the tank.\n\nIn the United States, federal requirements to upgrade pumps resulted in some stations improving the pumping experience for customers by adding news, weather, entertainment and commercials on TV screens in the pumps. Advertising on the pumps might include the station where the pump is located, and even the capability to print out coupons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/don-t-touch-that-dial-watch-tv-while-you-re/article_935c2714-84be-5184-bf7a-a45786fe7e9d.html|title=Don't touch that dial: Watch TV while you're pumping gas|last=Tighe|first=Mike|work=[[La Crosse Tribune]]|date=2015-02-25|accessdate=2019-11-11}}</ref> As of 2014, the company Gas Station TV had increased its number of stations from five in Texas eight years earlier to 2,600, reaching an estimated 50 million people.

In general, submersible solutions in Europe are installed in hotter countries, where suction pumps may have problems overcoming [[cavitation]] with warm fuels or when the distance from tank to pump is longer than a suction pump can manage.\n\nIn modern pumps, the major variations are in the number of hoses or grades they can dispense, the physical shape, and the addition of extra devices such as [[pay at the pump]] devices and attendant \"tag\" readers.\n\nLight passenger vehicle pump flow rate ranges up to about {{convert|50|l|USgal|abbr=off|lk=on}} per minute<ref name=ukcert>{{cite web |title=Certificate Pursuant to section 12 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296219/UK-2780-revision-3.pdf}}</ref> (the [[United States]] limits this to {{convert|10|USgal|l|abbr=off}} per minute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oms/regs/ld-hwy/evap/spitback.txt |title=The EPA 10 gallon per minute fuel dispensing limit |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=1997-09-24 |accessdate=2016-04-20}}</ref>); pumps serving trucks and other large vehicles have a higher flow rate, up to {{convert|130|l|USgal|abbr=off}} per minute in the UK,<ref name=ukcert/> and airline refueling can reach {{convert|1000|USgal|l|abbr=off}} per minute.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Large Aircraft Fuel Up |last=Austerman |first=Gary |date=May 1997 |publisher=Petroleum Equipment & Technology Archive |url=http://www.petrolplaza.com/technology/articles/MiZlbiYxMDIxMyYmMSYyJiY%3D}}</ref> Higher flow rates may overload the vapor recovery system in vehicles equipped with enhanced evaporative emissions controls<ref>{{cite web |title=California Refueling Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1998 Through 2000 Model Motor Vehicles |date=August 5, 1999 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/evap/orvr00.pdf}}</ref> (required since 1996 in the US), causing excess vapor emissions, and may present a safety hazard.\n\nHistorically, fuel dispensers had a very wide range of designs to solve the mechanical problems of mechanical pumping, reliable measurement, safety, and aesthetics. This has led to some popularity in collecting antique dispensers, especially in the USA.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/automobiles/collectibles/05PETRO.html?fta=y | work=The New York Times | title=Filling Up the Backyard With a Gas Station | first=Dave | last=Caldwell | date=October 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Fuel nozzles ===\nNozzles are attached to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's filling inlet. The hoses are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler.\n\nThe nozzles are usually color-coded to indicate which grade of fuel they dispense, however, the color-coding differs between countries or even retailers. For example, a black hose and handle in the UK indicate that the fuel dispensed is diesel, and a green dispenser indicates unleaded fuel; the reverse is common in the US.\n\nSome different types of fuel have specially sized nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps is supposed to be larger so that it cannot fit into the filler pipe on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles.  Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [[wikt:misfueling|misfueling]]. Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.\n\n=== Blending ===\nIn some countries, pumps are able to mix two fuel products together before dispensing; this is referred to as blending or mixing. Typical usages are in a \"mix\" pump to add oil to petrol for [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] [[motorcycle]]s, to produce an intermediate [[octane rating]] from separate high and low octane fuels, or to blend [[hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] ([[HCNG]]).  The benefit of blending for retailers is that it allows them to offer 3 grades of fuel while only having to maintain inventory of two grades.  This frees up both working capital and tank capacity and improves fuel turnover.\n\n[[File:Gas pump display, Jacksonville, FL.jpg|thumbnail|right|A pump display in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]]]\n\n=== Flow measurement ===\nOne of the most important functions for the pump is to accurately measure the amount of fuel pumped. [[Flow measurement]] is almost always done by a 4 stroke piston meter connected to an electronic encoder.<ref name=ukcert/> In older gas pumps, the meter is physically coupled to reeled numerical displays (moving wheels or cylinders with numbers on the side), while newer pumps turn the meter's movement into electrical pulses using a [[rotary encoder]].  In the U.S. flow speed is limited to 10 gallons per minute for cars and 40 gallons per minute for trucks.  This flow rate is based on the diameter of the vehicle's fuel filling pipe, which limits flow to these amounts.\n\n=== The metrology of gasoline ===\nGasoline is difficult to sell in a fair and consistent manner by volumetric units. It expands and contracts significantly as its temperature changes. A comparison of the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] for gasoline and liquid water at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C indicates that the volume of gasoline changes at about 4.5 times the rate of water.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) specifies the accuracy of the measurements in Handbook 44,<ref name=hb44>{{cite web |title=Handbook 44 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/hb44.cfm}}</ref> though states set their own legal standards. The standard accuracy is 0.3%, meaning that a {{convert|10|usgal|L|1|adj=on}} purchase may actually deliver {{convert|9.97|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10.03|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe reference temperature for gasoline volume measurement is 60&nbsp;\u00b0F or 15&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=sta/> Ten gallons of gasoline at that temperature expands to about {{convert|10.15|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|85|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and contracts to about {{convert|9.83|usgal|L|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|30|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Each of the three volumes represents the same theoretical amount of energy. In one sense, ten gallons of gasoline purchased at 30&nbsp;\u00b0F is about 3.2% more potential energy than ten gallons purchased at 85&nbsp;\u00b0F. Most gasoline is stored in tanks underneath the [[filling station]]. Modern tanks are non-metallic and sealed to stop leaks. Some have double walls or other structures that provide inadvertent thermal insulation while pursuing the main goal of keeping gasoline out of the soil around the tank. The net result is that while the air temperature can easily vary between {{convert|30|and|85|\u00b0F|}}, the gasoline in the insulated tank changes temperature much more slowly, especially in underground tanks, as deep soil temperature tends to remain in a narrow range throughout the year, regardless of air temperature.\n\nTemperature compensation is common at the wholesale transaction level in the United States and most other countries. At the retail consumer level, Canada has converted to automatic temperature compensation, and the UK is undergoing conversion, but the United States has not. Automatic temperature compensation, known as Standard Temperature Accounting in the UK, may add a tiny amount of additional uncertainty to the measurement, about 0.1%.<ref name=sta>{{cite web |title=STA Guidance |date=Feb 2016 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504706/STA_Guidance_Feb_2016_version_11.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere are far fewer retail outlets for gasoline in the United States today than there were in 1980. Larger outlets sell gasoline rapidly, as much as {{convert|30000|usgal|L|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in a single day, even in remote places. Most finished product gasoline is delivered in 8,000- to 16,000-gallon [[tank trucks]], so two deliveries in a 24-hour period is common. The belief is that the gasoline spends so little time in the retail sales system that its temperature at the point of sale does not vary significantly from winter to summer or by region. Canada has lower overall population densities and geographically larger gasoline distribution systems, compared with the United States. Temperature compensation at the retail level improves the fairness under those conditions.\n\nIn the United States, each of the 50 states has a Department of Weights and Measure, with the authority to perform all testing and certification, issuing fines for non-compliance. For example, in 2007 Arizona found that 9% of all pumps were at off by at least 2.5% (the threshold for fines), evenly split between overcounting and undercounting fuel.<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/07/01/20080701biz-gaspumps0630.html?nclick_check=1</ref>\n[[File:Florida Department of Agriculture Petroleum Inspection (cropped).jpg|thumb|A state petroleum inspector visiting a [[Mobil]] station in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]]]]\n\nIn some regions, regular required inspections are conducted to ensure the accuracy of fuel dispensers. For example, in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] conducts regular tests of calibration and fuel quality at individual dispensers. The department also conducts random undercover inspections using specially designed vehicles that can check the accuracy of the dispensers. The department issues correction required notices to stations with pumps found to be inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/standard/petro/index.html|title=Bureau of Petroleum Inspection|accessdate=2011-12-10|publisher=Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202102912/http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/standard/petro/index.html|archive-date=2010-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most other US states conduct similar inspections. In Canada, inspections are regularly conducted by the federal government agency [[Measurement Canada]]. Inspection dates and test results are required, by law, to be displayed on a sticker on fuel dispensers for consumers to see. Under a recently proposed legislation by the House of Commons (C-14: Fairness at the Pumps Act), fines for a vendor with a modified fuel dispenser or poorly maintained dispenser would be up to $50,000. However, virtually all pumps that fail inspection in Canada do so for general calibration errors caused by use over time. Intentional modification for the purpose of deceiving consumers is extremely rare.\n\n=== The metrology of hydrogen ===\nThe [[hydrogen fuel]] dispensers<ref>[http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&PAGE=showRelease&RELEASE_ID=2620 SAE International publishes new standard, SAE J2601, to establish worldwide basis for H2 fueling of fuel cell electric vehicles]</ref> in use on [[hydrogen stations]] dispense the fuel by the kilogram.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25413866 LA gas station gets hydrogen fuel pump]</ref> In the United States, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) specifies the accuracy of the measurements in Handbook 44.

Traditionally these variations gave pump manufacturers a natural tie-in for their own point-of-sale systems, since only they understood the protocols.<ref>[http://www.ifsf.org/Software/IFSF%20Management%20Intro%20-%20V3.01.pdf IFSF Management Intro, sec 1.1 Background history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824121152/http://www.ifsf.org/Software/IFSF%20Management%20Intro%20-%20V3.01.pdf |date=August 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nAn effort to standardize this in the 1990s resulted in the [[International Forecourt Standards Forum]], which has had considerable success in Europe, but has less presence elsewhere.  (\"[[Forecourt]]\" refers to the land area on which the fuel dispensers are located.)\n\nBy October 2017, all United States gas pumps had to use [[EMV]] technology for payment. A year before this change was required, a third of 750,000 pumps needed upgrading at a cost of $17,000 plus the cost of hardware and software. With some software not expected to be ready, some [[Fuel card|fleet cards]] not having [[Smart card|chip technology]] available in time, not enough technicians for the installations, and many businesses having a difficult time affording the upgrade, it was predicted the conversion would take until 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-gas-station-chip-card-upgrade-20161031-story.html|title=For gas-station operators, chip card upgrade is a pain in the pump|last=Kharif|first=Olga|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|via=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Automatic cut-off in fuel dispenser ===\nThe shut-off valve was invented in [[Olean, New York]] in 1939 by Richard C. Corson. At a loading dock at the [[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]], Corson observed a worker filling a barrel with gasoline and thought it inefficient. The sound of a toilet flushing later gave him the idea for a \"butterfly float.\" After developing a prototype with his assistant, Paul Wenke, Corson gave the suggestion to the company who later filed for a patent in his name. The initial intent of the device was to \"allow a person to fill more than one barrel [of gasoline] at the same time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents?id=N5VFAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Patent US2316934 - Barrel Filler|publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> This mechanism eventually developed into the modern gasoline pump cut-off valve.<ref>{{cite news| last=Sampson|first=Julia |title=Did you know?

In the UK, for example, any new forecourt with a predicted throughput in excess of 500 m<sup>3</sup> per month is required to have active vapour recovery installed.\n\n===Early designs===\n<gallery> <!-- alphabetized by country and state where the image was taken -->\nFile:Zapfs\u00e4ule BP Wien.jpg|Fuel pump in [[Vienna]], Austria.\nFile:\u00d6mossa 31.jpg|A 1991 photograph of a fuel pump in [[\u00d6mossa]] village, [[Kristinestad]], [[Finland]].\nFile:Petrol Pump, Quillan, France.jpg|Antique fuel pump in [[Quillan]], [[France]].\nFile:Historische Zapfsaeule.jpg|Antique [[diesel fuel]] pump located at [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]], [[Konz]], Germany.\nFile:Verschiedene Zapfs\u00e4ulen Deutsches Museum.jpg|Display of various antique fuel pumps at [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]], Germany.\nFile:Alte Zapfs\u00e4ulen 1X7A7980.jpg|Display of various antique fuel pumps at Retro Classics 2018 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany.\nFile:Old-Gas-Pumps.jpg|Old [[Soviet Union]] fuel pumps.\nFile:G-Morcomb's Service Station Gas Pumps.jpg|Gasoline pumps once used at the historic Morcomb's Service Station in [[Glendale, Arizona]].

The exact details differ between countries and can depend to some extent on politics.\n\nFor example, in countries fighting corruption, such as Mexico,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/13/business/fi-stickup13 |first=Marla |last=Dickerson |first2=Carlos |last2=Martinez |title=Not Quite Measuring Up at Mexico's Gas Pumps |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2006-06-13 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> gas pumps may be more stringently monitored by government officials, in order to detect attempts to defraud customers.\n\nTypically, individual pumps must be certified for operation after installation by a government [[weights and measures]] inspector, who tests that the pump displays the same amount that it dispenses. [[Measurement Canada]] is the federal agency responsible for pump regulations in Canada and stickers are displayed on the pumps.\n\nHydrogen fuel dispensers may be regulated under terms drawn from an industry technical standard, [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] J2601.<ref>[http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&PAGE=showRelease&RELEASE_ID=2620 SAE International Publishes New standard, SAE J2601, to Establish Worldwide Basis for H2 Fueling of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles]</ref>\n\nIn Taiwan, continuous fuel flow is not allowed for self service pumps; the driver must grip the nozzle until the desired amount of fuel has been delivered or until the shutoff switch is triggered.{{CN|date=February 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fast fuel system]]\n* [[Electric car charger]]\n* [[Cascade storage system]]\n* [[HCNG dispenser]]\n* [[Point of sale]] electronic system connected to fuel dispensers for processing sale transactions\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Petrol pumps}}\n* [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_263.html How does a gas pump know to shut itself off?] from ''The Straight Dope''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fuel Dispenser}}\n[[Category:Pumps]]\n[[Category:Petroleum infrastructure]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Filling stations]]\n[[Category:19th-century inventions]]\n", "name_user": "76.92.177.230", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_dispenser"}

After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found at a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam, who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough rest. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonnaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them.

From July to the start of the following year, each team plays the others twice for 26 fixtures. They are [[Group tournament ranking system|ranked]] by total points, and then divided according to their position in order to enter either the championship play-off or the relegation play-out. After this stage, the points are halved in two and criteria such as [[goal difference]], goals scored etc. are erased completely.\n\nThe clubs which enter the championship play-off play ten games, while the ones in the relegation play-out play an additional four. The championship play-off winner is also crowned winner of the season's Liga I. The two lowest placed teams in the relegation play-out are directly relegated to the [[Liga II]], while the third-lowest plays a relegation/promotion play-off with the third-best ranked team in the second tier.\n\n==Clubs==\n{{See also|Football records and statistics in Romania}}\n\n===Wins by club===\n{{Main|List of Romanian football champions}}\n'''Bold''' indicates clubs currently playing in [[2019\u201320 Liga I]].

Three to four thousand years ago, [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] people arrived, bringing with them domesticated pigs, chickens, dogs, and [[obsidian]] tools. The first European contact with Bougainville was in 1768, when the French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] arrived and named the main island for himself.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nBritish and American whaling ships visited the island for provisions, water and wood in the 19th century. The first on record was the ''Roscoe'' in 1822, and the last was ''Palmetto'' in 1881.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific Ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.184-5. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] laid claim to Bougainville in 1899, annexing it into [[German New Guinea]]. Christian missionaries arrived on the island in 1902.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\n[[File:Marines on Bougainville.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] on Bougainville in 1943]]\nDuring [[World War I]], Australia occupied German New Guinea, including Bougainville.

Following the war, the Territory of New Guinea, including Bougainville, returned to Australian control.\n\nIn 1949, the Territory of New Guinea, including Bougainville, merged with the Australian [[Territory of Papua]], forming the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]], a [[United Nations trust territories|United Nations Trust Territory]] under Australian administration.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nOn 9 September 1975, the [[Parliament of Australia]] passed the [[Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975]]. The Act set 16 September 1975 as date of independence and terminated all remaining sovereign and legislative powers of Australia over the territory. Bougainville was to become part of an independent [[Papua New Guinea]]. However, on 11 September 1975, in a failed bid for self-determination, Bougainville declared itself the [[Republic of the North Solomons]]. The republic failed to achieve any international recognition, and a settlement was reached in August 1976. Bougainville was then absorbed politically into Papua New Guinea with increased self-governance powers.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nBetween 1988 and 1998, the [[Bougainville Civil War]] claimed over 15,000 lives. Peace talks brokered by [[New Zealand]] began in 1997 and led to autonomy. A multinational [[Peace Monitoring Group]] (PMG) under Australian leadership was deployed. In 2001, a peace agreement was signed including promise of a [[2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum|referendum on independence]] from Papua New Guinea.

It is part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] [[ecoregion]]. Bougainville and the nearby island of Buka are a single [[landmass]] separated by a deep 300-metre-wide strait. The island has an area of 9000 square kilometres, and there are several active, dormant or inactive volcanoes which rise to 2400&nbsp;m.

Three to four thousand years ago, [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] people arrived, bringing with them domesticated pigs, chickens, dogs, and [[obsidian]] tools. The first European contact with Bougainville was in 1768, when the French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] arrived and named the main island for himself.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nBritish and American whaling ships visited the island for provisions, water and wood in the 19th century. The first on record was the ''Roscoe'' in 1822, and the last was ''Palmetto'' in 1881.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific Ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.184-5. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] laid claim to Bougainville in 1899, annexing it into [[German New Guinea]].

Bougainville was to become part of an independent [[Papua New Guinea]]. However, on 11 September 1975, in a failed bid for self-determination, Bougainville declared itself the [[Republic of the North Solomons]]. The republic failed to achieve any international recognition, and a settlement was reached in August 1976.

He chose to first attack and take the Baja California peninsula as a first step to seize Sonora. Aboard the schooner'' Caroline,'' Walker's expedition arrived at [[Cabo San Lucas]] on October 28 of that year.
