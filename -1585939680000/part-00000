Set at [[Easter]] 1300, the poem describes the living poet's journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise.\n\nThroughout the poem, Dante refers to people and events from [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] and [[Biblical]] history and [[mythology]], the history of [[Christianity]], and the Europe of the [[Medieval]] period up to and including his own day. A knowledge of at least the most important of these references can aid in understanding the poem fully.\n\nFor ease of reference, the cantica names are abbreviated to Inf., Purg., and Par. [[Roman numerals]] are used to identify cantos and [[Arabic numerals]] to identify lines. This means that '''Inf. X, 123''' refers to line 123 in Canto X (or 10) of the Inferno and '''Par. XXV, 27''' refers to line 27 in Canto XXV (or 25) of the Paradiso. The line numbers refer to the original Italian text.\n\nBoldface links indicate that the word or phrase has an entry in the list.

POSIX also defines a standard [[thread (computing)|threading]] library API which is supported by most modern operating systems.
