Previously, all these celebrations were advanced by more than twelve hours. The [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]] and the [[Easter Vigil]] were celebrated in the morning of Thursday and Saturday respectively, and [[Holy Week]] and [[Lent]] were seen as ending only on the approach of Easter.\n\nAfter the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] at the Mass of the Lord's Supper, all church bells are silenced and the organ is not used.

Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called [[Seven Churches Visitation]], which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual [[Stripping of the Altar|stripping]] of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks. In the present form as revised in 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony at some time after the evening Mass.\n\nThe [[liturgical colour]] for the Mass vestments and other ornaments is white in the Catholic and Anglican Churches.<ref>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 346]</ref> In the Lutheran Church, the liturgical colour for Maundy Thursday is white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Liturgical-Colors.aspx|title=What is the meaning and use of liturgical colors?|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|quote=Maundy Thursday: For this fourth day of Holy Week, celebrated as the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper, scarlet or white is used.|accessdate=1 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404093828/http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Liturgical-Colors.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012}}</ref> In the [[Reformed]] tradition, white or gold may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/worship/liturgies/liturgical-colors.html?print=t|title=Liturgical Colors and the seasons of the church year|publisher=[[United Church of Christ]]|quote=On Maundy Thursday, White or Gold symbolizes the church's rejoicing in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.

In the Catholic ritual, [[clergy]] traditionally begin the service [[prostration|prostrate]] in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name \"Mass of the Presanctified\". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day.  Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.<ref name=veiling>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur72.htm Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent]</ref> Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.\n\nColors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Missal]] the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, [[black vestments]] are sometimes used.

In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism.\n\nIn current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from [[sin]] and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as [[candelabra]] lit throughout the church.  If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins.<ref name=veiling/> (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the \"Gloria in Excelsis\" of the Easter Vigil Mass.)\n\nColor of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes.\n\nEaster Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass.\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n==Easter time==\n{{Main|Eastertide}}\nThe date of Easter [[Easter#Date|varies from year to year]]. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The [[Julian Calendar]] is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and is accepted even by [[Latin Church]] Catholics in countries such as [[Ethiopia]] and [[Greece]].   In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar's 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar's 4 April and 8 May.\n\nDuring the Easter [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the [[Annunciation]] (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 60. This is an exception to the normal rule that impeded solemnities are transferred to the closest day not ranked as feast or higher.</ref>\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 5</ref> \"The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent.\"<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 56</ref>\n\nThe solemnity of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. [[Pentecost]] (or [[Whitsun]]) is the fiftieth day.\n\nThe Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at [[None (liturgy)|None]] of the following [[Ember Saturday]].\n\nDuring the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Week]]\n*[[Holy Week procession]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/triduumquestions.shtml Eighteen Questions on the Paschal Triduum]\n*[http://www.gbod.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=nhLRJ2PMKsG&b=5560695&ct=7793155#notes The Three Days (The United Methodist Church GBOD)]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Catholic spirituality]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:Catholic devotions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday}}\n[[File:Meister des Hausbuches 003.jpg|thumb|''Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles'' by Meister des Hausbuches, 1475 ([[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]], [[Berlin]])]]\nThe '''Paschal Triduum''' ([[Latin]]: ''Triduum Paschale''),<ref>For the etymology of the term ''Paschal'' see ''[[Names of Easter#From Greek Pascha|Names of Easter]]''.</ref> '''Holy Triduum''' (Latin: ''Triduum Sacrum''), or '''Easter Triduum''', or the '''Three Days''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Planning/Three-Days.aspx|title=The Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter|year=2012|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> is the period of three days that begins with the liturgy on the evening of [[Maundy Thursday]],<ref name=\"CL Thurs\">[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/324/Start/319 Catholic Liturgy, Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper]</ref> reaches its high point in the [[Easter Vigil]], and closes with evening prayer on [[Easter Sunday]]. <ref name=General>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/101/Start/97 General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 19]</ref> It recalls the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]], [[entombment of Christ|burial]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus]], as portrayed in the [[canonical Gospels]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bibleresources.americanbible.org/bible-resources/bible</ref>\n\nIn the [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], [[Moravian]] and [[Reformed]] traditions, the Paschal Triduum straddles the two liturgical seasons of [[Lent]] and [[Eastertide|Easter]] in the [[Church calendar]] ([[Holy Saturday]] is the last day of Lent, with the [[Easter Vigil]] being the first liturgy of Eastertide); however, in the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, since the [[Pope Pius XII#Liturgy reforms|1955 reform]] by [[Pope Pius XII]], the Easter Triduum has been more clearly distinguished as a separate liturgical period. Previously, all these celebrations were advanced by more than twelve hours. The [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]] and the [[Easter Vigil]] were celebrated in the morning of Thursday and Saturday respectively, and [[Holy Week]] and [[Lent]] were seen as ending only on the approach of Easter.\n\nAfter the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] at the Mass of the Lord's Supper, all church bells are silenced and the organ is not used.

Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called [[Seven Churches Visitation]], which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual [[Stripping of the Altar|stripping]] of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks.

In the Catholic ritual, [[clergy]] traditionally begin the service [[prostration|prostrate]] in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name \"Mass of the Presanctified\". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day.  Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.<ref name=veiling>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur72.htm Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent]</ref> Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.\n\nColors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Missal]] the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, [[black vestments]] are sometimes used.

The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the [[Exsultet]] is intoned.\n\nAfter the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] and seven [[Psalms]]. At least three of these readings and associated psalms must be read, which must include the account of the first [[Passover]] from the [[Book of Exodus]].
