On rare occasions, the [[Amoeba|amoebic parasite]] will invade the body through the bloodstream and [[Systemic disease|spread beyond the intestines]].  In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human lungs|lungs]], and most commonly the [[Human liver|liver]].<ref name=Diagnosis>{{cite web | website=mdguidelines.com | title=Dysentery-Diagnosis | url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | accessdate=November 17, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063637/http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | archivedate=14 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n[[File:A cross-section of diseased intestines (dysentery). Coloured Wellcome V0009858ER.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of diseased intestines. Colored lithograph {{circa|1843}}]]\n\nDysentery results from [[bacteria]]l, or [[Parasitism|parasitic]] infections. Viruses do not generally cause the disease.<ref name=CDC2019/> These pathogens typically reach the [[large intestine]] after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on.\n\nEach specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal linings, leading to the [[Inflammation|inflammatory immune responses]]. This can cause [[Fever|elevated physical temperature]], painful spasms of the intestinal muscles ([[cramping]]), swelling due to fluid leaking from capillaries of the intestine ([[edema]]) and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called [[cytokine]]s, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. [[Anemia]] may also arise due to the blood loss through diarrhea.\n\nBacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boards and Beyond: Infectious Disease|last=Ryan|first=Jason|year=2016|isbn=|edition=Version 9-26-2016|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome microorganisms &ndash; for example, bacteria of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'' &ndash; secrete substances known as [[cytotoxin]]s, which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Shigella is thought to cause bleeding due to invasion rather than toxin, because even non-toxogenic strains can cause dysentery, but E. coli with shiga-like toxins do not invade the intestinal mucosa, and are therefore toxin dependent.\n\nDefinitions of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to \"diarrhea with visible blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |work=WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.8 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, Georgia 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305065701/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Others define the term more broadly.<ref name=TFD>{{cite web|title=Dysentery|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysentery|publisher=TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary}}</ref> These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.\n\n===Amoebic dysentery===\n{{main|Amoebiasis}}\n\n[[Amoebiasis]], also known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by an infection from the [[amoeba]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO | title=''Amoebiasis. Report of a WHO Expert Committee |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |year=1969 |volume=421 |pages=1\u201352 |pmid=4978968 | author-link=World Health Organization }}</ref> which is found mainly in tropical areas.<ref>{{MeshName|Amebic+Dysentery}}</ref> Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to [[Amoebiasis#Complications|severe, potentially fatal, complications]].\n\nWhen amoebae inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor \u2013 for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically \u2013 then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.\nIf another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.\nAfter entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.\n\n===Bacillary dysentery===\n{{Main|Bacillary dysentery}}\n\nDysentery may also be caused by [[shigellosis]], an infection by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Shigella'', and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term ''bacillary dysentery'' etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any [[bacillus (shape)|bacilliform]] bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to ''Shigella'' dysentery.\n\n===Other bacteria===\n\nSome strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cause bloody diarrhea. The typical culprits are [[shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'']], of which [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] is the best known.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Dysentery should not be confused with [[hematochezia]], which is the passage of fresh blood through the anus, usually in or with stools.\n\n===Physical exam===\nThe mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n===Stool and blood tests===\n\n[[cell culture|Cultures]] of [[stool sample]]s are examined to identify the organism causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the number of amoebae, which changes daily.<ref name=Diagnosis/> [[Blood test]]s can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential [[electrolyte|minerals and salts]].<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n==Prevention==\nEfforts to prevent dysentery include [[hand washing]] and [[food safety]] measures while traveling in areas of high risk.<ref name=NHS2019/>\n\n===Vaccine===\nAlthough there is currently no vaccine which protects against ''Shigella'' infection, several are in development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|title=WHO vaccine pipeline tracker|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725174627/http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Vaccination may eventually become a part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, ''Shigella'' is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies.\n\n== Treatment ==\nDysentery is managed by maintaining fluids using [[oral rehydration therapy]]. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for [[intravenous]] fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an [[amebicide|amoebicidal]] drug to kill the [[parasite]], and an [[antibiotic]] to treat any associated bacterial infection.\n\nIf shigellosis is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable \u2014 usually less than a week. If the case is severe, antibiotics such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|TMP-SMX]] or oral cefixime may be useful. However, many strains of ''Shigella'' are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition.\n\nAmoebic dysentery is often treated with two antimicrobial drugs such as [[metronidazole]] and [[paromomycin]] or [[iodoquinol]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 3 Infectious Diseases Related To Travel|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|website=CDC|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=August 1, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124434/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\n\nWith correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within 10 days, and most individuals achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment.  If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease.

Coloured Wellcome V0009858ER.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of diseased intestines. Colored lithograph {{circa|1843}}]]\n\nDysentery results from [[bacteria]]l, or [[Parasitism|parasitic]] infections. Viruses do not generally cause the disease.<ref name=CDC2019/> These pathogens typically reach the [[large intestine]] after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on.\n\nEach specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal linings, leading to the [[Inflammation|inflammatory immune responses]]. This can cause [[Fever|elevated physical temperature]], painful spasms of the intestinal muscles ([[cramping]]), swelling due to fluid leaking from capillaries of the intestine ([[edema]]) and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called [[cytokine]]s, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. [[Anemia]] may also arise due to the blood loss through diarrhea.\n\nBacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boards and Beyond: Infectious Disease|last=Ryan|first=Jason|year=2016|isbn=|edition=Version 9-26-2016|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome microorganisms &ndash; for example, bacteria of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'' &ndash; secrete substances known as [[cytotoxin]]s, which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Shigella is thought to cause bleeding due to invasion rather than toxin, because even non-toxogenic strains can cause dysentery, but E. coli with shiga-like toxins do not invade the intestinal mucosa, and are therefore toxin dependent.\n\nDefinitions of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to \"diarrhea with visible blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |work=WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.8 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, Georgia 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305065701/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Others define the term more broadly.<ref name=TFD>{{cite web|title=Dysentery|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysentery|publisher=TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary}}</ref> These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.\n\n===Amoebic dysentery===\n{{main|Amoebiasis}}\n\n[[Amoebiasis]], also known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by an infection from the [[amoeba]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO | title=''Amoebiasis. Report of a WHO Expert Committee |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |year=1969 |volume=421 |pages=1\u201352 |pmid=4978968 | author-link=World Health Organization }}</ref> which is found mainly in tropical areas.<ref>{{MeshName|Amebic+Dysentery}}</ref> Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to [[Amoebiasis#Complications|severe, potentially fatal, complications]].\n\nWhen amoebae inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor \u2013 for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically \u2013 then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.\nIf another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.\nAfter entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.\n\n===Bacillary dysentery===\n{{Main|Bacillary dysentery}}\n\nDysentery may also be caused by [[shigellosis]], an infection by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Shigella'', and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term ''bacillary dysentery'' etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any [[bacillus (shape)|bacilliform]] bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to ''Shigella'' dysentery.\n\n===Other bacteria===\n\nSome strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cause bloody diarrhea. The typical culprits are [[shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'']], of which [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] is the best known.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Dysentery should not be confused with [[hematochezia]], which is the passage of fresh blood through the anus, usually in or with stools.\n\n===Physical exam===\nThe mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n===Stool and blood tests===\n\n[[cell culture|Cultures]] of [[stool sample]]s are examined to identify the organism causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the number of amoebae, which changes daily.<ref name=Diagnosis/> [[Blood test]]s can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential [[electrolyte|minerals and salts]].<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n==Prevention==\nEfforts to prevent dysentery include [[hand washing]] and [[food safety]] measures while traveling in areas of high risk.<ref name=NHS2019/>\n\n===Vaccine===\nAlthough there is currently no vaccine which protects against ''Shigella'' infection, several are in development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|title=WHO vaccine pipeline tracker|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725174627/http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Vaccination may eventually become a part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, ''Shigella'' is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies.\n\n== Treatment ==\nDysentery is managed by maintaining fluids using [[oral rehydration therapy]]. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for [[intravenous]] fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an [[amebicide|amoebicidal]] drug to kill the [[parasite]], and an [[antibiotic]] to treat any associated bacterial infection.\n\nIf shigellosis is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable \u2014 usually less than a week. If the case is severe, antibiotics such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|TMP-SMX]] may be useful. However, many strains of ''Shigella'' are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition.\n\nAmoebic dysentery is often treated with two antimicrobial drugs such as [[metronidazole]] and [[paromomycin]] or [[iodoquinol]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 3 Infectious Diseases Related To Travel|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|website=CDC|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=August 1, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124434/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\n\nWith correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within 10 days, and most individuals achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterised by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nThe word church stems from the word ''chirche'' from Middle English. People are not sure of where this word came from but scholars think it is derived from the greek word ''kuriakon. Kuriakon'' comes from another word ''kuriakos'' which means \"of, or belonging to ''a'' lord, master,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abetter.world/articles/the-true-meaning-of-church/|title=The True Meaning of \u201cChurch\u201d|last=Allis|first=David|date=2007-02-04|website=A Better World|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic - France (Mid-12th century }==\t\n===Abbot Suger and [[St Denis Basilica]]===\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals.

It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Early Gothic - England ==\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.

They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added colour and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180.

Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colours.

At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further.

Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.

Construction began in about 1175, after the Bishop, Reginald de Bohan, visited France and saw the early Gothic works. It was the first English cathedral to be Gothic from the beginning. Following the early Gothic style, it originally stressed width rather than height. The major achievement was the west front (1225-1240, decorated with 400 statues, of which 3200 still exist, depicting the [[Day of Judgement]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The statues were originally painted in bright colours. In the early 14th century, following changes in the liturgy, the Cathedral saw major additions in the decorated style, which were finished in 1326.  These included the addition of a new octagonal chapel, and a retro-choir with unusual scissor arches, built in 1338-48 to strengthen the support of the tower above.  .

The south transept was completed first, then the nave, completed in 1275. They built on top of the original Romanesque foundations, which accounts for the unusual wide spacing of the pillars of the grand arcades. The facade was begun in 1277, using the reddish [[sandstone]] of the [[Vosges]] mountains. A spire was added to the north tower, completed in 1439.

After his death in 1353, the King of [[Bohemia]], Charles IV, selected a young Bohemian builder, [[Petr Parler]], twenty-three years old, to continue the work. The south tower and spire followed the model of the cathedrals of the [[Rhineland]].  The great originality was in the interior, where Parler made imaginative use of more decorative vaults, in fan shapees, with their ribs rising through space, and decorative bosses hanging down the from the ceiling. <ref>''Encylopaedia Britannica'' on-line, ''Prague Cathedral'', retrieved April 22, 2020</ref>  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Italian High Gothic ==\nItaly resisted the Gothic style, using the Romanesque style longer than in Northern Europe, and unlike Northern Europe, it only rarely imitated the French style.   Also, building available building materials were different;  Italian cathedrals were usually built of brick, not stone, and marble was abundant. Italian architects did adapt the some aspects of the northern style, including the rib vault and columns attached to the walls. Early examples were the '''  [[Pisa Baptistry]]''' (1259-60) and the facade of ''' [[Siena Cathedral]]''' (1265-68). <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, Western Architecture, High Gothic (retrieved April 24, 2020)</ref>.

Burgos Cathedral was first constructed between 1221 and 1257 in the French Rayonnant style, with its typical three story elevation, vaulting and tracery,  and an abundance of rich sculpture, particularly around the portals.  Beginning in the mid-15th century, it was largely rebuilt and redecorated in the Flamboyant stye, with a new choir a cupola with star vaulting, a latern tower, and new portals, grills and choir stalls. The new work was not completed until 1567.  The Burgos workshop continued to train Spanish sculptors and artisans.

It aimed for rich visual effects through decoration, and gave predominance to vertical lines, especially in the window tracery. Windows occupied the major part of the wall space.  The architects also experimented with various kinds of decorative vaults, such as the [[fan vault]], where most of the thin ribs, springing upward  from slender columns, were purely decorative.   Major examples of the style include Gloucester Cathedral, [[King's College Chapel]] at [[Cambridge University]], and the chapel of Henry IV in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, \"Perpendicular style, Gothic Architecture (retrieved\nApril 24, 2020)</ref>\n*  '''[[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1089-1499)''' contains elements from every period of Gothic architecture, as well as even earlier vestiges of [[Norman Architecture]].

It began in Italy, particularly in Florence, and was based on admiration for ancient Roman models.  It led to copying Greek and Roman sculpture, and then classical architectural models, such as the column, round arch and the dome. \n\nIn France, the transition was most evident at the church of  '''[[Saint-Eustache, Paris]]''' in Paris, located next to the  city market of [[Les Halles]], begun in 1532 by the Italian architect [[Domenico da Cortona]], the favourite of King [[Francis I of France]],  who also designed many of the Renaissance elements of the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]. Because of technical and financial difficulties and the intervening [[Wars of Religion]], it was not finished until 1640. It was largely Gothic on the exterior, but the interior was a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance classicism, such as hanging pendants from keystones of the vaults, and orders of classical columns.   It received a new classical west front by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] in 1754. During the French Revolution it was pillaged and turned into the Temple of Agriculture, and suffered a fire in 1844, but was restored. <ref>Dumoulin, Aline and others, \"Eglises de Paris - Les Essentiels de Patrimoine'' (2010) pp. 18-23</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:St.-Eustache.jpg|Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris]] (1532-1640)\nFile:Church of St Eustace Interior, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|The interior of Saint-Eustance was mixture of Gothic and Renaissance details (1532-1640\nFile:P1340752 Paris Ier eglise St-Eustache melange styles rwk.jpg|The mixture of Gothic and classical columns at Saint-Eustache\n</gallery>\n\n==The choir - a Theater for Ceremony==\nA Gothic cathedral or church was a house of worship and also a theater for ceremony, with a fixed ritual every day.   The most numerous participants in these ceremonies were the [[Canon (priest)|canons]], or members of the [[Cathedral chapter]]. The number of canons in a chapter varied from twelve in a small cathedral to fifty at [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and more than eighty at [[Laon Cathedral]].  In addition to celebrating [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]], every day, they were expected to celebrate the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] four times a day, with four additional offices on Sundays. To this very regular schedule were attached numerous additional duties and ceremonies.  <ref>Mignon (2015), pg. 46</ref>\n\nMost of these ceremonies took place in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] (sometimes spelled 'quire') of the cathedral, toward the eastern end, between the  nave to the west and the sanctuary to the east. The choir was like  a church within the church; it was divided from the rest of the cathedral by an ornamental screen composed of bas-reliefs illustrating stories from the life of Christ. It also featured a richly decorated tribune, used for reading the appropriate texts from the bible.  The main [[altar]] was also found within the choir, turned toward the east.  The canons were seated in two rows of carved wooden seats, facing each other, at right angles to the seats in the nave.  There is just one remaining original medieval rood screen in a Gothic cathedral, at [[Albi Cathedral]] in the south of France. <ref>Mignon (2015), pg. 46</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Albi Sainte-C\u00e9cile Cathedral Roodscreen 2009-06-25.jpg|The remaining original Gothic [[rood screen]], in [[Albi Cathedral]]\nFile:Stalles Cath\u00e9drale d'Amiens 280808 06.jpg|Choir stalls in [[Amiens Cathedral]]\nFile:Chorgest\u00fchl K\u00f6lner Dom -6226.jpg|Choir stalls in [[Cologne Cathedral]]\n</gallery>|\n\n==Stained glass ==\n\nStained glass windows were a prominent feature of the Gothic church and cathedral from the beginning. Abbot [[Suger]], who considered that light was a manifestation of the divine, installed colorful windows in the ambulatory of [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], and they were featured in all the major cathedrals in France, England and the rest of Europe.  In the 13th and 14th century they became larger and larger, until they filled entirely walls. However, they lost some of the original simplicity and richness of color, as the artists competed with painters and fresco artists in making huge windows crowded with naturalistic figures. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020)</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, glass makers and stained glass artists were separate professions. Glass makers worked near forests, where there was abundant firewood for melting and forming glass, while the artists worked closer to the building sites. In the earlier cathedrals and churches, the range of colors was limited, and the color was added when the glass was manufactured. with the use of metallic oxides; [[cobalt]] for blue, [[copper]] for a ruby red, [[manganese]] for purple, and [[antimony]] for yellow. The glass was melted with the colors, blown, shaped into cylinders, rolled flat, and then cut into sheets of about 10-12 inches (25-30 centimetres). The pieces of glass of early windows varied considerably in thickness, which gave more richness and variation than in later windows. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020</ref>\n\nThe colored glass was delivered to the workshop of the artist, where the window was made. A large whitewashed table was painted with the full-size drawing of the window, with colors indicated. the artisans used a hot iron to crack off pieces of colored glass to fit the pattern, \"grazed\" or smoothed the edges, then fit them into long strips of lead.  The strips of lead with glass were then assembled and soldered together. Details such as faces, ornament and inscriptions were painted on the glass in vitreous enamel, then heated to fuse the enamel with the glass. The window was then waterproofed with putty along the lead strips, and then, since the lead was flexible, cited into a larger iron frame. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020</ref>\n\nAs windows continued to grow in size, they needed further support against the wind, This was provided by [[tracery]] and [[mullions]], thin stone ribs into which the sections of the windows were fit. As the windows grew larger, the tracery became more and more intricate, taking on Rayonnant and flamboyant designs. In this way the architecture and windows gradually became blended together and inseparable.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 05.jpg|Christ between figures representing church and the synagogue, [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (12th century)\nFile:Chartres - Vie de Charlemagne.JPG|Detsil of Life of Charlemagne, Bay 7 of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1225)\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral Window sII 2b (12089788646).jpg|Saint Barnabas, detail of window of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1201-1235) \nFile:Baptism Sainte-Chapelle MNMA Cl23717.jpg|Detail of baptism scene of stained glass from [[Sainte-Chapelle]] now in [[Cluny Museum]] (1238-48)\n</gallery>\n===Rose windows===\nCircular windows had existed in Roman times, and simple a rose window had been used in Romanesque churches.  One early example is  [[Pomposa Abbey]] in  Pomposa, Italy, from the 10th century.  Gothic windows had a more important position, and surpassed the earlier windows in size and complexity.  The [[Abbey of Saint Denis]] had a small [[rose window]] on the west facade, above the three deep bays of the portals, an arrangement followed by subsequent cathedrals in France. In the 12th century, large rose windows were also added to the north and south transepts.  The transept roses at Notre Dame date to 1250 (north) and 1260 (south).  Besides Notre Dame, other notable Rayonnant windows were constructed at [[Reims Cathedral]] and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  These featured additional subdividing bars, arches and circles.  From France, the rose window spread to Spain {[[Burgos Cathedral]]}, England ([[Lincoln Cathedral]]) and Italy ([[Carrara Cathedral]]).  The later Flamboyant rose windows became much more free in their designs, with sinuous, double-curved bars. Examples are found at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] (early 16th century).<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line \"Rose Window\" (retrieved April 28, 2020)</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Reims ND5 tango7174.jpg|[[Reims Cathedral]], Rayonnant north transept rose window (1211-1345)\nFile:Gothic-Rayonnant Rose-6.jpg|[[Notre Dame de Paris]], Rayonnant north transept window (about 1250)\nFile:Beauvais Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre Nord-Rosette 2.jpg|[[Beauvais Cathedral]]  flamboyant North transept rose window (16th century)\nFile:Rose Window of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, Interior View 140308 1.jpg|Flamboyant rose window of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (original glass smashed during the [[French Revolution]]) (1379-1480)\n</gallery>\n\n== Portal and facade sculpture ==\nBy long Christian tradition, the altar of cathedrals was at the east end, facing the sunrise, while the main entrance was on the west. Following the Romanesque tradition, the west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], built 1137-40,  set the style for French Gothic cathedrals; three bays and three doors, each with. carved stone [[tympanum]] of sculpture within the arch over the lintel above the door.  The voussoirs, the wedge-shaped alongside the arches, were also filled with figures.  Unfortunately one original doorway was destroyed, and the sculptures on the remaining two are mostly 19th century recreations. <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, \"Western sculpture\" (retrieved April 28, 2020) </ref>\n\nThe three portals of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], altogether forty meters wide, are among th finest examples of High Gothic The sculptural decoration of the central door is devoted to the [[Last Judgement]], on the left to [[Virgin Mary]], for whom the Cathedral is named, and on the right to [[Saint Anne]].  The Voussures are crowded with small sculptures of angels and saints. In addition there are ranks of sculpture representing the occupations of the months, and the virtues and the vices, and above the portals are additional galleries  representing the Kings of France and scenes of the life of the Virgin Mary. <ref>Larousse Encyclopedia on line, ''Art Gothique''.</ref> \n\nIn the 13th century the facade sculpture became more natural and expressive, as in the famous smiling angel on the north portal of the west facade of [[Reims Cathedral]]. The drapery of the figures and the sculpted plants and flowers were carved with realism and attention to detail.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:P3050226 Basilique Saint-Denis Portail central reduct.JPG|Tympanum of the central portal of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] (1137-1140)\nFile:France - Paris (31177993925).jpg|Detail of sculpture in the central portal of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] (13th century)\nFile:Reims, Kathedrale, Westportal, Engel.jpg|The High Gothic- Smiling Angel,north portal of west facade of Reims Cathedral, by the St. Joseph Master.

Realistic  sculpture also appeared in the 13th century on the west front of Strasbourg, begun in 1272,  and in the German states, such as at [[Naumburg Cathedral]] (now a Protestant church) (1250).  These were in a delicate style called ''Muldenstil''.  \n\nIn Italy, the finest period for Cathedral sculpture was between 1250 and 1350, in the work of [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistry]] (1259-60), and [[Siena Cathedral]] (1265-68), and in the work of his son, Giovanni Pisano, on he facade of Siena Cathedal.  [[Andrea]]  Pisano (not related to Nicola and Giovanni) was celebrated for his bronze doors of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]].  The work of the Pisanos carried Italian sculpture from the Gothic age to the Roman models of the Renaissance. <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, \"Western sculpture\" (retrieved April 28, 2020) </ref>  \n  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Wells cathedral 26.JPG|The gable of [[Wells Cathedral]], with Christ the Judge (modern replacement) above the twelve [[apostles]] and the nine [[archangels]].

Traces of the paint have been found on the walls and sculpture.  A few cathedrals, like [[Albi Cathedral]] in the south of France, still have some of their original color, and others, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the  [[Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres]] in Paris, have been restoring or recreating the earlier designs, or, in the case of Chartres, cleaning the walls and painting them white. This practice has been criticized by some, who prefer the walls covered with centuries of soot. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterised by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nThe word church stems from the word ''chirche'' from Middle English. People are not sure of where this word came from but scholars think it is derived from the greek word ''kuriakon. Kuriakon'' comes from another word ''kuriakos'' which means \"of, or belonging to ''a'' lord, master,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abetter.world/articles/the-true-meaning-of-church/|title=The True Meaning of \u201cChurch\u201d|last=Allis|first=David|date=2007-02-04|website=A Better World|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic - France (Mid-12th century }==\t\n===Abbot Suger and [[St Denis Basilica]]===\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration. It originally had two towers.(1140-1144)\nFile:France Paris St-Denis Basilica Nativity.jpg|Detail from the 12th-century Life of Christ window\n</gallery>\t\nThe new features of Saint-Denis were quickly adapted in the construction of new cathedrals in the Ile-de-France,  These included [[Noyon cathedral]] (begun 1150), [[Senlis Cathedral]] begun (1153); [[Sens Cathedral]] (begun 1160); and [[Laon Cathedral]] (begun 1160).  Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Early Gothic - England ==\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added colour and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high. Alterations to the Cathedral continued until 1834. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg|[[Canterbury Cathedral (1174-1834) The exterior was largely rebuilt into the perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th century. \nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u201384).

The builders made use of the Gothic [[rib vault]] in constructing the new nave and choir. These were replaced by the  more decorative [[lierne (vault)|lierne vault]] in the late 13th century.  Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height. The great spire fell during a windstorm and was not replaced.\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral viewed from Lincoln Castle.jpg| [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1192-1225)\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral Nave 1, Lincolnshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The elaborate vaults of the nave were added in the 1ate 12th and 13th century. \n</gallery>\n* '''[[Whitby Abbey]]  and [[Rievaulx Abbey]] ''' The early Gothic style was also used in the reconstruction of several English  [[abbeys]], notably the [[Benedictine]] [[Whitby Abbey]], and the [[Cistercian]] [[Rievaulx Abbey]], which had great importance at the time, though they were both built in secluded areas of the country far from the cites.  Rievaulx Abbey was begun in 1132 in the Romanesque style.  All he monasteries were closed by Henry VIII in 1538, as part of his [[dissolution of monasteries]].

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colours. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colours are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

Its nave is 145 meters long and 70 meters wide at the transept. Its elevation copied Chartres in having just three, not four levels, but the plan was very different.  At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]].

The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1210. The Archbishop Aubrey de Humbert began a new cathedral in the Gothic style in 1211. The choir was finished in 1241.  Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.

It lasted from about the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fourteenth century.  The simple and functional quadrapartite [[rib vault]] was  replaced by more elaborate [[lierne]] vault and fan fault, whose ribs were largely decorative. <ref>Encyclop\u00e6edia Britannica on-line, \"High Gothic\" (retrieved April 20, 2020)</ref>\n\n[[Henry III of England]] (1207-72) was an important patron of this new style, both with additions to [[Westminster Abbey]] (after 1245) and in the east end of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] (1258).

Construction began in about 1175, after the Bishop, Reginald de Bohan, visited France and saw the early Gothic works. It was the first English cathedral to be Gothic from the beginning. Following the early Gothic style, it originally stressed width rather than height. The major achievement was the west front (1225-1240, decorated with 400 statues, of which 3200 still exist, depicting the [[Day of Judgement]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The statues were originally painted in bright colours. In the early 14th century, following changes in the liturgy, the Cathedral saw major additions in the decorated style, which were finished in 1326.  These included the addition of a new octagonal chapel, and a retro-choir with unusual scissor arches, built in 1338-48 to strengthen the support of the tower above.  .

The rebuilding began in the original Romanesque style, but when the builders saw the new French style at Chartres,  they changed their plans and began anew.  The south transept was completed first, then the nave, completed in 1275. They built on top of the original Romanesque foundations, which accounts for the unusual wide spacing of the pillars of the grand arcades. The facade was begun in 1277, using the reddish [[sandstone]] of the [[Vosges]] mountains. A spire was added to the north tower, completed in 1439.

The architects also experimented with various kinds of decorative vaults, such as the [[fan vault]], where most of the thin ribs, springing upward  from slender columns, were purely decorative.

It began in Italy, particularly in Florence, and was based on admiration for ancient Roman models.  It led to copying Greek and Roman sculpture, and then classical architectural models, such as the column, round arch and the dome. \n\nIn France, the transition was most evident at the church of  '''[[Saint-Eustache, Paris]]''' in Paris, located next to the  city market of [[Les Halles]], begun in 1532 by the Italian architect [[Domenico da Cortona]], the favourite of King [[Francis I of France]],  who also designed many of the Renaissance elements of the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]. Because of technical and financial difficulties and the intervening [[Wars of Religion]], it was not finished until 1640. It was largely Gothic on the exterior, but the interior was a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance classicism, such as hanging pendants from keystones of the vaults, and orders of classical columns.

The most numerous participants in these ceremonies were the [[Canon (priest)|canons]], or members of the [[Cathedral chapter]]. The number of canons in a chapter varied from twelve in a small cathedral to fifty at [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and more than eighty at [[Laon Cathedral]].  In addition to celebrating [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]], every day, they were expected to celebrate the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] four times a day, with four additional offices on Sundays. To this very regular schedule were attached numerous additional duties and ceremonies.  <ref>Mignon (2015), pg. 46</ref>\n\nMost of these ceremonies took place in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] (sometimes spelled 'quire') of the cathedral, toward the eastern end, between the  nave to the west and the sanctuary to the east. The choir was like  a church within the church; it was divided from the rest of the cathedral by an ornamental screen composed of bas-reliefs illustrating stories from the life of Christ. It also featured a richly decorated tribune, used for reading the appropriate texts from the bible.  The main [[altar]] was also found within the choir, turned toward the east.  The canons were seated in two rows of carved wooden seats, facing each other, at right angles to the seats in the nave.

Abbot [[Suger]], who considered that light was a manifestation of the divine, installed colorful windows in the ambulatory of [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], and they were featured in all the major cathedrals in France, England and the rest of Europe.  In the 13th and 14th century they became larger and larger, until they filled entirely walls. However, they lost some of the original simplicity and richness of color, as the artists competed with painters and fresco artists in making huge windows crowded with naturalistic figures. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020)</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, glass makers and stained glass artists were separate professions. Glass makers worked near forests, where there was abundant firewood for melting and forming glass, while the artists worked closer to the building sites. In the earlier cathedrals and churches, the range of colors was limited, and the color was added when the glass was manufactured. with the use of metallic oxides; [[cobalt]] for blue, [[copper]] for a ruby red, [[manganese]] for purple, and [[antimony]] for yellow. The glass was melted with the colors, blown, shaped into cylinders, rolled flat, and then cut into sheets of about 10-12 inches (25-30 centimetres). The pieces of glass of early windows varied considerably in thickness, which gave more richness and variation than in later windows. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020</ref>\n\nThe colored glass was delivered to the workshop of the artist, where the window was made. A large whitewashed table was painted with the full-size drawing of the window, with colors indicated. the artisans used a hot iron to crack off pieces of colored glass to fit the pattern, \"grazed\" or smoothed the edges, then fit them into long strips of lead.  The strips of lead with glass were then assembled and soldered together. Details such as faces, ornament and inscriptions were painted on the glass in vitreous enamel, then heated to fuse the enamel with the glass. The window was then waterproofed with putty along the lead strips, and then, since the lead was flexible, cited into a larger iron frame. <ref>Encylpaedia Britannica on-line, \"Stained Glass\" (retrieved April 26, 2020</ref>\n\nAs windows continued to grow in size, they needed further support against the wind, This was provided by [[tracery]] and [[mullions]], thin stone ribs into which the sections of the windows were fit. As the windows grew larger, the tracery became more and more intricate, taking on Rayonnant and flamboyant designs. In this way the architecture and windows gradually became blended together and inseparable.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 05.jpg|Christ between figures representing church and the synagogue, [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (12th century)\nFile:Chartres - Vie de Charlemagne.JPG|Detsil of Life of Charlemagne, Bay 7 of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1225)\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral Window sII 2b (12089788646).jpg|Saint Barnabas, detail of window of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1201-1235) \nFile:Baptism Sainte-Chapelle MNMA Cl23717.jpg|Detail of baptism scene of stained glass from [[Sainte-Chapelle]] now in [[Cluny Museum]] (1238-48)\n</gallery>\n===Rose windows===\nCircular windows had existed in Roman times, and simple a rose window had been used in Romanesque churches.  One early example is  [[Pomposa Abbey]] in  Pomposa, Italy, from the 10th century.  Gothic windows had a more important position, and surpassed the earlier windows in size and complexity.  The [[Abbey of Saint Denis]] had a small [[rose window]] on the west facade, above the three deep bays of the portals, an arrangement followed by subsequent cathedrals in France. In the 12th century, large rose windows were also added to the north and south transepts.  The transept roses at Notre Dame date to 1250 (north) and 1260 (south).  Besides Notre Dame, other notable Rayonnant windows were constructed at [[Reims Cathedral]] and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  These featured additional subdividing bars, arches and circles.  From France, the rose window spread to Spain {[[Burgos Cathedral]]}, England ([[Lincoln Cathedral]]) and Italy ([[Carrara Cathedral]]).  The later Flamboyant rose windows became much more free in their designs, with sinuous, double-curved bars. Examples are found at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] (early 16th century).<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line \"Rose Window\" (retrieved April 28, 2020)</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Reims ND5 tango7174.jpg|[[Reims Cathedral]], Rayonnant north transept rose window (1211-1345)\nFile:Gothic-Rayonnant Rose-6.jpg|[[Notre Dame de Paris]], Rayonnant north transept window (about 1250)\nFile:Beauvais Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre Nord-Rosette 2.jpg|[[Beauvais Cathedral]]  flamboyant North transept rose window (16th century)\nFile:Rose Window of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, Interior View 140308 1.jpg|Flamboyant rose window of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (original glass smashed during the [[French Revolution]]) (1379-1480)\n</gallery>\n\n== Portal and facade sculpture ==\nBy long Christian tradition, the altar of cathedrals was at the east end, facing the sunrise, while the main entrance was on the west. Following the Romanesque tradition, the west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], built 1137-40,  set the style for French Gothic cathedrals; three bays and three doors, each with. carved stone [[tympanum]] of sculpture within the arch over the lintel above the door.  The voussoirs, the wedge-shaped alongside the arches, were also filled with figures.  Unfortunately one original doorway was destroyed, and the sculptures on the remaining two are mostly 19th century recreations. <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, \"Western sculpture\" (retrieved April 28, 2020) </ref>\n\nThe three portals of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], altogether forty meters wide, are among th finest examples of High Gothic The sculptural decoration of the central door is devoted to the [[Last Judgement]], on the left to [[Virgin Mary]], for whom the Cathedral is named, and on the right to [[Saint Anne]].  The Voussures are crowded with small sculptures of angels and saints. In addition there are ranks of sculpture representing the occupations of the months, and the virtues and the vices, and above the portals are additional galleries  representing the Kings of France and scenes of the life of the Virgin Mary. <ref>Larousse Encyclopedia on line, ''Art Gothique''.</ref> \n\nIn the 13th century the facade sculpture became more natural and expressive, as in the famous smiling angel on the north portal of the west facade of [[Reims Cathedral]]. The drapery of the figures and the the sculpted plants and flowers were carved with realism and attention to detail.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:P3050226 Basilique Saint-Denis Portail central reduct.JPG|Tympanum of the central portal of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] (1137-1140)\nFile:France - Paris (31177993925).jpg|Detail of sculpture in the central portal of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] (13th century)\nFile:Reims, Kathedrale, Westportal, Engel.jpg|The High Gothic- Smiling Angel,north portal of west facade of Reims Cathedral, by the St. Joseph Master. (1240)\n</gallery>\nIn England, the sculpture was not confined to the portals, but was placed all across the facade, as on the gable of [[Wells Cathedral]]. Realistic  sculpture also appeared in the 13th century on the west front of Strasbourg, begun in 1272,  and in the German states, such as at [[Naumburg Cathedral]] (now a Protestant church) (1250).  These were in a delicate style called ''Muldenstil''.  \n\nIn Italy, the finest period for Cathedral sculpture was between 1250 and 1350, in the work of [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistry]] (1259-60), and [[Siena Cathedral]] (1265-68), and in the work of his son, Giovanni Pisano, on he facade of Siena Cathedal.  [[Andrea]]  Pisano (not related to Nicola and Giovanni) was celebrated for his bronze doors of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]].  The work of the Pisanos carried Italian sculpture from the Gothic age to the Roman models of the Renaissance. <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, \"Western sculpture\" (retrieved April 28, 2020) </ref>  \n  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Wells cathedral 26.JPG|The gable of [[Wells Cathedral]], with Christ the Judge (modern replacement) above the twelve [[apostles]] and the nine [[archangels]].

Traces of the paint have been found on the walls and sculpture.  A few cathedrals, like [[Albi Cathedral]] in the south of France, still have some of their original color, and others, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the  [[Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres]] in Paris, have been restoring or recreating the earlier designs, or, in the case of Chartres, cleaning the walls and painting them white. This practice has been criticized by some, who prefer the walls covered with centuries of soot. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

The show centered on the professional and personal life of [[San Francisco]] police Inspector Harry Hooperman, played by [[John Ritter]]. The series was created by [[Steven Bochco]] and [[Terry Louise Fisher]], who were the team responsible for creating ''[[L.A. Law]]''. Though not the first comedy-drama (the long-running television series [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'']] could also be categorized as one), ''Hooperman'' was considered the vanguard of a new television genre when it premiered, and critics coined the term \"[[dramedy]]\" to describe it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title=Critic says \u2018MASH\u2019 top show of character|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/awards/critic-says-mash-top-show-of-character-1118059360/|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Variety|date=21 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hyatt|first=Wesley|title=Television's Top 100|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-4891-3|page=171|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4891-3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326163815/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4891-3|archivedate=2011-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelley|first1=Bill|title=The Best And The Brightest Abc`s Hooperman -- The Hands-down Winner Of The Best New Show Of The Year -- Introduces A New Format, ``dramedy,`` While Slap Maxwell Reintroduces Dabney Coleman.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-09-23/features/8703150300_1_hooperman-lewis-erlicht-brandon-stoddard|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=27 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nRitter plays San Francisco police Inspector Harry Hooperman. In the first episode, Hooperman inherits the rundown apartment building he lives in when his elderly landlady is killed in a robbery. He also inherits her temperamental pet [[Jack Russell terrier]] named Bijoux. Due to the demands of his job as a police officer, he hires Susan Smith (played by [[Debrah Farentino]]) to be the building manager, and the pair become romantically involved throughout the first season.\n\nAlso starring on the show was Alix Elias as the cheerful and bubbly police dispatcher, Betty Bushkin; [[Barbara Bosson]] was Hooperman's divorced superior, Capt. Celeste \"C.Z.\" Stern; Felton Perry as Harry's partner, Inspector Clarence McNeil; Clarence Felder as redneck inspector Boris \"Bobo\" Pritzger; [[Joseph Gian]] as Rick Silardi, a gay cop, and [[Sydney Walsh]] as officer Maureen \"Mo\" DeMott, his patrol partner who was intent on \"saving\" him from being gay by making unwanted passes.  [[Dan Lauria]] played Celeste's former husband, Lou Stern.\n\nThe theme music was composed by [[Mike Post]].\n\nGuest stars in the series' 42-episode run included: [[Don Cheadle]], [[Kim Delaney]], [[Dennis Dugan]], [[Norman Fell]] (who worked with Ritter on ''[[The Stone Killer]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]]''), [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Jack Gilford]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Joanna Kerns]], [[Richard Kind]], [[Dan Lauria]], [[Jane Leeves]], [[Lorna Luft]], [[David Paymer]], [[Barbara Rush]], and [[Shannon Tweed]].\n\nExcept for a brief syndicated run on the [[FX Network]] in the mid 1990s, and the pilot rebroadcast on [[TV Land]] in 2003 following Ritter's death, the series has not aired since then.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=January 2018}}\n===Season 1 (1987\u201388)===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#fcae28; width:20px\"| {{abbr|N\u00ba|Overall episode number}}\n! style=\"background:#fcae28; width:20px\"| {{abbr|Ep|Episode number by season}}\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\" width:135px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n| Title = Hooperman\n| DirectedBy = [[Gregory Hoblit]] \n| WrittenBy = [[Steven Bochco]] & [[Terry Louise Fisher]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|23}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = The Answer My Friend Is Passing in the Wind\n| DirectedBy = Gregory Hoblit\n| WrittenBy = Steven Bochco & Terry Louise Fisher\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|30}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n| Title = Don We Now Our Gay Apparel\n| DirectedBy = [[Rick Wallace]]\n| WrittenBy = Steven Bochco & Terry Louise Fisher\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = Aria da Capo\n| DirectedBy = [[John Patterson (director)|John Patterson]]\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Leon Tokatyan<br>''Story by:'' Steven Bochco\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|14}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = John Doe, We Hardly Knew Ye\n| DirectedBy = John Patterson\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Rick Kellard<br>''Story by:'' [[Lydia Woodward]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|28}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = The Shooting\n| DirectedBy = Nick Havinga\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Leon Tokatyan<br />''Story by:'' Steven Bochco & Amy K.

The show centered on the professional and personal life of [[San Francisco]] police Inspector Harry Hooperman, played by [[John Ritter]]. The series was created by [[Steven Bochco]] and [[Terry Louise Fisher]], who were the team responsible for creating ''[[L.A. Law]]''. Though not the first comedy-drama (the long-running television series [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'']] could also be categorized as one), ''Hooperman'' was considered the vanguard of a new television genre when it premiered, and critics coined the term \"[[dramedy]]\" to describe it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title=Critic says \u2018MASH\u2019 top show of character|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/awards/critic-says-mash-top-show-of-character-1118059360/|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Variety|date=21 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hyatt|first=Wesley|title=Television's Top 100|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-4891-3|page=171|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4891-3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326163815/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4891-3|archivedate=2011-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelley|first1=Bill|title=The Best And The Brightest Abc`s Hooperman -- The Hands-down Winner Of The Best New Show Of The Year -- Introduces A New Format, ``dramedy,`` While Slap Maxwell Reintroduces Dabney Coleman.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-09-23/features/8703150300_1_hooperman-lewis-erlicht-brandon-stoddard|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=27 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nRitter plays San Francisco police Inspector Harry Hooperman. In the first episode, Hooperman inherits the rundown apartment building he lives in when his elderly landlady is killed in a robbery. He also inherits her temperamental pet [[Jack Russell terrier]] named Bijoux. Due to the demands of his job as a police officer, he hires Susan Smith (played by [[Debrah Farentino]]) to be the building manager, and the pair become romantically involved throughout the first season.\n\nAlso starring on the show was Alix Elias as the cheerful and bubbly police dispatcher, Betty Bushkin; [[Barbara Bosson]] was Hooperman's divorced superior, Capt. Celeste \"C.Z.\" Stern; Felton Perry as Harry's partner, Inspector Clarence McNeil; Clarence Felder as redneck inspector Boris \"Bobo\" Pritzger; [[Joseph Gian]] as Rick Silardi, a gay cop, and [[Sydney Walsh]] as officer Maureen \"Mo\" DeMott, his patrol partner who was intent on \"saving\" him from being gay by making unwanted passes.  [[Dan Lauria]] played Celeste's former husband, Lou Stern.\n\nThe theme music was composed by [[Mike Post]].\n\nGuest stars in the series' 42-episode run included: [[Don Cheadle]], [[Kim Delaney]], [[Dennis Dugan]], [[Norman Fell]] (who worked with Ritter on ''[[The Stone Killer]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]]''), [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Jack Gilford]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Joanna Kerns]], [[Richard Kind]], [[Dan Lauria]], [[Jane Leeves]], [[Lorna Luft]], [[David Paymer]], [[Barbara Rush]], and [[Shannon Tweed]].\n\nExcept for a brief syndicated run on the [[FX Network]] in the mid 1990s, and the pilot rebroadcast on [[TV Land]] in 2003 following Ritter's death, the series has not aired since then.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=January 2018}}\n===Season 1 (1987\u201388)===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#fcae28; width:20px\"| {{abbr|N\u00ba|Overall episode number}}\n! style=\"background:#fcae28; width:20px\"| {{abbr|Ep|Episode number by season}}\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#fcae28\" width:135px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n| Title = Hooperman\n| DirectedBy = [[Gregory Hoblit]] \n| WrittenBy = [[Steven Bochco]] & [[Terry Louise Fisher]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|23}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = The Answer My Friend Is Passing in the Wind\n| DirectedBy = Gregory Hoblit\n| WrittenBy = Steven Bochco & Terry Louise Fisher\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|30}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n| Title = Don We Now Our Gay Apparel\n| DirectedBy = [[Rick Wallace]]\n| WrittenBy = Steven Bochco & Terry Louise Fisher\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = Aria da Capo\n| DirectedBy = [[John Patterson (director)|John Patterson]]\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Leon Tokatyan<br>''Story by:'' Steven Bochco\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|14}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = John Doe, We Hardly Knew Ye\n| DirectedBy = John Patterson\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Rick Kellard<br>''Story by:'' [[Lydia Woodward]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|28}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = fcae28\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = The Shooting\n| DirectedBy = Nick Havinga\n| WrittenBy = ''Teleplay by:'' Leon Tokatyan<br />''Story by:'' Steven Bochco & Amy K.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R. Medical University]] (1989), [[Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University|Veterinary and Animal Sciences University]] (1989), [[Periyar University]] (1997) and [[Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University|Dr. Ambedkar Law University]] (1996).\n\nIn 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background. The motto scroll is edged red, with black lettering. The English translation of the motto of the University of Madras is: \"Learning promotes natural talent.\"\n\n==Senate House==\n{{See also|Senate House (University of Madras)}}\nThe University of Madras has a historical monument&nbsp;\u2013 [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]&nbsp;\u2013 which is one of the landmarks of the city of Chennai. The Senate House, the University's first building, inaugurated in the year 1879, is a masterpiece of [[Robert Fellowes Chisholm]], an architect of the 19th century, who blended the Indo-Saracenic style with Byzantine and European architectural features. The university renovated the Senate House in 2006.\n\n==Campuses and constituent colleges ==\n[[File:Senate Hall, Chepauk.jpg|thumb|The Senate House]]\n[[File:3 Madras University.JPG|thumb|University centenary auditorium]]\nThe university is spread over six campuses, namely, [[Chepauk]], [[Marina Beach|Marina]], [[Guindy]], [[Taramani]], [[Chetput (Chennai)|Chetput]] and [[Maduravoyal]]. The ''Chepauk'' campus of the university houses the VC's secretariat, central library, clock tower, centenary auditorium and the historic [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]. The oriental and Indian languages departments are located in the ''Marina'' campus. The ''Guindy'' campus incorporates the natural sciences departments while the campus at ''Taramani'' houses the school of basic medical sciences. The sports union and the botanical garden are based in ''Chetpet'' and ''Maduravoyal'' campus respectively.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R. Medical University]] (1989), [[Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University|Veterinary and Animal Sciences University]] (1989), [[Periyar University]] (1997) and [[Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University|Dr. Ambedkar Law University]] (1996).\n\nIn 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background. The motto scroll is edged red, with black lettering. The English translation of the motto of the University of Madras is: \"Learning promotes natural talent.\"\n\n==Senate House==\n{{See also|Senate House (University of Madras)}}\nThe University of Madras has a historical monument&nbsp;\u2013 [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]&nbsp;\u2013 which is one of the landmarks of the city of Chennai. The Senate House, the University's first building, inaugurated in the year 1879, is a masterpiece of [[Robert Fellowes Chisholm]], an architect of the 19th century, who blended the Indo-Saracenic style with Byzantine and European architectural features. The university renovated the Senate House in 2006.\n\n==Campuses and constituent colleges ==\n[[File:Senate Hall, Chepauk.jpg|thumb|The Senate House]]\n[[File:3 Madras University.JPG|thumb|University centenary auditorium]]\nThe university is spread over six campuses, namely, [[Chepauk]], [[Marina Beach|Marina]], [[Guindy]], [[Taramani]], [[Chetput (Chennai)|Chetput]] and [[Maduravoyal]]. The ''Chepauk'' campus of the university houses the VC's secretariat, central library, clock tower, centenary auditorium and the historic [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]. The oriental and Indian languages departments are located in the ''Marina'' campus. The ''Guindy'' campus incorporates the natural sciences departments while the campus at ''Taramani'' houses the school of basic medical sciences. The sports union and the botanical garden are based in ''Chetpet'' and ''Maduravoyal'' campus respectively.

Steinbrueck is best known for his efforts to preserve the city's [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] and [[Pike Place Market]].\n\n==Biography==\nSteinbrueck was born in [[Mandan, North Dakota]], and came to Seattle in 1913.  In 1930 he enrolled in the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|University of Washington Program in Architecture]], graduating in 1935 with a Bachelor of Architecture ([[B.Arch.]]).  In this period he also worked in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].  After apprenticing in a number of private Seattle firms and serving in the military during [[World War II]], he joined the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Washington]] in 1946.  He also initiated his own practice and, over the next two decades, designed a series of regional-modernist residences, built with indigenous materials suited to the climate.\n\nSteinbrueck's focus on the character of Seattle's architecture and urban places dates from the early 1950s when he authored ''A Guide to Seattle Architecture'', published for  [[American Institute of Architects]] national convention held in Seattle in 1953.  Steinbrueck went on to publish several other books promoting awareness of the unique character of [[Seattle]]:  ''Seattle Cityscape'' (1962; published to coincide with [[Century 21 Exposition|Century 21]], the Seattle World's Fair), ''Market Sketchbook'' (1968), and ''Seattle Cityscape #2'' (1973).\n\nIn the 1960s Steinbruck became active in [[historic preservation]], and, with others, successfully fought developers' plans to obliterate Seattle's most significant historic district.  He was instrumental in the creation of Seattle's first two historic districts, [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] (1970) and [[Pike Place Market]] (1971).   His own projects were guided by a strong sense of public spirit and social consciousness:  low-income housing, the inclusion of social services, and a number of city parks co-designed with [[landscape architect]] [[Richard Haag]], including the one that now bears his name.\n\nWorking as a consultant to [[John Graham, Jr. (architect)|John Graham & Company]], Steinbrueck played a key role in the design work of the [[Space Needle]] contributing the hour glass shape of the support structure.

In the [[edict]], Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity.{{efn|In 1898, the tricentennial celebrated the edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the title, ''Coexister dans l'intol\u00e9rance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).}} The edict separated civil from [[religious]] unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] and [[Heresy|heretics]], and opened a path for [[secularism]] and tolerance. In offering general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field or for the state and to bring grievances directly to the [[King of France|king]]. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]] that had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.\n\nThe [[Edict of St. Germain]], promulgated 36 years before by [[Catherine de M\u00e9dici]], had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]].\n\nThe later [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which revoked the Edict of Nantes in October 1685, was promulgated by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV. It drove an exodus of Protestants and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Edict aimed primarily to end the long-running [[French Wars of Religion]].{{efn|A detailed chronological account of the negotiations that led to the Edict's promulgation has been offered by Janine Garrisson, ''L'\u00c9dit de Nantes: Chronique d'une paix attendue'' (Paris: Fayard) 1998.}} Henry IV also had personal reasons for supporting the Edict. Prior to assuming the throne in 1589 he had espoused Protestantism, and he remained sympathetic to the Protestant cause: he had converted to Catholicism in 1593 only in order to secure his position as king, supposedly saying \"Paris is well worth a Mass\". The Edict succeeded in restoring peace and internal unity to France, though it pleased neither party: Catholics rejected the apparent recognition of Protestantism as a permanent element in French society and still hoped to enforce religious uniformity, while Protestants aspired to parity with Catholics. \"Toleration in France was a royal notion, and the religious settlement was dependent upon the continued support of the crown.\"<ref name=\"Rothrock17\">George A. Rothrock, Jr., \"Some Aspects of Early Bourbon Policy toward the Huguenots\" ''Church History'' '''29'''.1 (March 1960:17\u201324) p. 17.</ref>\n\nRe-establishing royal authority in France required internal peace, based on limited toleration enforced by the crown. Since royal troops could not be everywhere, Huguenots needed to be granted strictly circumscribed possibilities of self-defense.<ref name=\"Rothrock17\" />\n\n==The Edict==\n[[Image:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry IV of France]] by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]].]]\nThe Edict of Nantes that Henry IV signed comprised four basic texts, including a principal text made up of 92 articles and largely based on unsuccessful peace treaties signed during the recent wars. The Edict also included 56 \"particular\" (secret) articles dealing with Protestant rights and obligations. For example, the French state guaranteed protection of French Protestants travelling abroad from the [[Inquisition]]. \"This crucifies me,\" protested [[Pope Clement VIII]], upon hearing of the Edict. The final two parts consisted of ''brevets'' ([[letters patent]]) which contained the military clauses and pastoral clauses. These two brevets were withdrawn in 1629 by [[Louis XIII]], following a final religious civil war.\n\nThe two [[letters patent]]<ref>Texts published in [[\u00c9lie Benoist|Benoist]] 1693 I:62\u201398 (noted by Rothrock).</ref> supplementing the Edict granted the Protestants<!--fifty or one hundred?--> safe havens (''places de s\u00fbret\u00e9''), which were military strongholds such as [[La Rochelle]], in support of which the king paid 180,000 [[\u00e9cu]]s a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (''places de refuge''), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an act of toleration was unusual in Western Europe,{{efn|For Eastern Europe, see [[Mehmed II#Mehmed II.27s Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans|Mehmed II's Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans]] or the [[Warsaw Confederation]].}} where standard practice forced subjects to follow the religion of their ruler \u2014 the application of the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.\n\nWhile it granted certain privileges to Huguenots, the edict upheld Catholicism's position as the established religion of France. Protestants gained no exemption from paying the [[tithe]]{{efn|The King engaged to support the Protestant ministers in part recompense.}} and had to respect [[feast day|Catholic holiday]]s and restrictions regarding marriage. The authorities limited Protestant freedom of worship to specified geographic areas. The Edict dealt only with Protestant and Catholic coexistence; it made no mention of [[Jew]]s, or of [[Muslim]]s, who were offered temporary asylum in France when the [[Moriscos]] were being expelled from Spain.{{efn|The ''ordonnance'' of 22 February 1610 stipulated that the emigr\u00e9s settle north of the [[Dordogne]] (safely away from the manipulations of Spanish agents) and that they embrace the Catholic faith; those who did not wish to do so were granted right of passage to French ports on the Mediterranean, to take ship for [[Barbary]].<ref>L. P. Harvey, ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614'', 2005:318</ref> By the time the ''ordonnance'' was published Henri IV had been assassinated.}}\n\nThe original Act which promulgated the Edict has disappeared. The ''[[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]]'' in Paris preserves only the text of a shorter document modified by concessions extracted from the King by the clergy and the [[Parlement of Paris]], which delayed ten months before finally signing and setting seals to the document in 1599. A copy of the first edict, sent for safekeeping to Protestant [[Geneva]], survives. The provincial [[parlement]]s resisted in their turn; the most recalcitrant, the parlement of Rouen, did not unreservedly register the Edict until 1609.<ref>Rothrock 1960:23 note 6.</ref>\n\nThe location of the signing is uncertain. The Edict itself states merely that it is \"given at [[Nantes]], in the month of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight\". By the late 19th century the Catholic tradition<ref>Reported in Baedeker, ''Northern France'', 1889.</ref> cited the signing in the \"Maison des Tourelles\", home of prosperous Spanish trader Andr\u00e9 Ruiz; it was destroyed by bombing in World War II.\n\n==Revocation==\n{{main|Edict of Fontainebleau}}\n[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|Louis XIV, by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]]]\nThe Edict remained unaltered in effect, registered by the parliaments as \"fundamental and irrevocable law,\" with the exception of the ''brevets,'' which had been granted for a period of eight years, and were renewed by Henry in 1606 and in 1611 by [[Marie de' Medici|Marie de M\u00e9decis]], who confirmed the Edict within a week of the assassination of Henry, stilling Protestant fears of another [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. The subsidies had been reduced by degrees, as Henry gained more control of the nation.<ref>A point made in Rothrock 1960:19.</ref> By the peace of Montpellier in 1622, concluding a Huguenot revolt in Languedoc, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two, [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]. The ''brevets'' were entirely withdrawn in 1629, by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], following the [[Siege of La Rochelle]], in which [[Cardinal Richelieu]] blockaded the city for fourteen months.\n\nDuring the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year, voiced in declarations and orders, and in case decisions in the Council, fluctuating according to the tides of domestic politics and the relations of France with powers abroad.<ref>Ruth Kleinman, \"Changing Interpretations of the Edict of Nantes: The Administrative Aspect, 1643\u20131661\" ''French Historical Studies'' '''10'''.4 (Autumn 1978:541\u2013571.</ref>\n\nIn October 1685, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. This act, commonly called the '''revocation of the Edict of Nantes'',' had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place.  All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country.  In spite of the prohibition, the persecution including many examples of torture caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1685revocation.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=www.fordham.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu/page/220 220] |url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu|url-access = registration |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref> Most moved to [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Huguenots in South Africa|South Africa]] and the [[New France|new French colonies]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America.<ref>See [[History of the French in Louisville]].</ref> This exodus deprived France of many of its most skilled and industrious individuals, some of whom thenceforward aided France's rivals in the Netherlands and in England. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes also further damaged the perception of Louis XIV abroad, making the Protestant nations bordering France even more hostile to his regime. Upon the revocation of the edict, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which encouraged Protestants to come to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].\n\nFreedom to worship and civil rights for non-Catholics in France were not restored until the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]], by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] 102 years later, on 7 November 1787. This edict was enacted by [[parlement]] two months later, less than two years before the end of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]] would fully eliminate religious discrimination in France.<ref>[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=2012-07-14 }}, downloaded 29 January 2012</ref>\n\n==Literal translation==\nThe principal and most salient provisions of Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, as promulgated at Nantes in Brittany probably on 30 April 1598, include:<ref>History Guide, [http://historyguide.org/earlymod/nantes.html The Edict of Nantes (1598)]</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>Henri, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:\n\nAmong the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom.  The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers.  God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety,\u2014peace for our state.  For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work....

First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened....\n\nIII.  We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and re\u00ebstablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them....\n\nVI.  And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences, ...  upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict.\n\nVII.  It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses....\n\nIX.  We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgments to the contrary....\n\nXIII.  We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict.\n\nXIV.  It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city....\n\nXVIII.  We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity....\n\nXXI.  Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted.\n\nXXII.  We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats, and public charities.</poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Edict of Toleration]]\n*[[Freedom of religion]]\n*[[List of treaties]]\n*[[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]], a precursor to Henry IV's policies\n*[[Peace of Vervins]]\n*[[Warsaw Confederation (1573)]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\nThe source followed by most modern historians is the Huguenot refugee [[\u00c9lie Benoist]]'s ''Histoire de l'\u00e9dit de Nantes'', 3 vols.

In the [[edict]], Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity.{{efn|In 1898, the tricentennial celebrated the edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the title, ''Coexister dans l'intol\u00e9rance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).}} The edict separated civil from [[religious]] unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] and [[Heresy|heretics]], and opened a path for [[secularism]] and tolerance. In offering general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field or for the state and to bring grievances directly to the [[King of France|king]]. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]] that had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.\n\nThe [[Edict of St. Germain]], promulgated 36 years before by [[Catherine de M\u00e9dici]], had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]].\n\nThe later [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which revoked the Edict of Nantes in October 1685, was promulgated by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV. It drove an exodus of Protestants and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Edict aimed primarily to end the long-running [[French Wars of Religion]].{{efn|A detailed chronological account of the negotiations that led to the Edict's promulgation has been offered by Janine Garrisson, ''L'\u00c9dit de Nantes: Chronique d'une paix attendue'' (Paris: Fayard) 1998.}} Henry IV also had personal reasons for supporting the Edict. Prior to assuming the throne in 1589 he had espoused Protestantism, and he remained sympathetic to the Protestant cause: he had converted to Catholicism in 1593 only in order to secure his position as king, supposedly saying \"Paris is well worth a Mass\". The Edict succeeded in restoring peace and internal unity to France, though it pleased neither party: Catholics rejected the apparent recognition of Protestantism as a permanent element in French society and still hoped to enforce religious uniformity, while Protestants aspired to parity with Catholics. \"Toleration in France was a royal notion, and the religious settlement was dependent upon the continued support of the crown.\"<ref name=\"Rothrock17\">George A. Rothrock, Jr., \"Some Aspects of Early Bourbon Policy toward the Huguenots\" ''Church History'' '''29'''.1 (March 1960:17\u201324) p. 17.</ref>\n\nRe-establishing royal authority in France required internal peace, based on limited toleration enforced by the crown. Since royal troops could not be everywhere, Huguenots needed to be granted strictly circumscribed possibilities of self-defense.<ref name=\"Rothrock17\" />\n\n==The Edict==\n[[Image:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry IV of France]] by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]].]]\nThe Edict of Nantes that Henry IV signed comprised four basic texts, including a principal text made up of 92 articles and largely based on unsuccessful peace treaties signed during the recent wars. The Edict also included 56 \"particular\" (secret) articles dealing with Protestant rights and obligations. For example, the French state guaranteed protection of French Protestants travelling abroad from the [[Inquisition]]. \"This crucifies me,\" protested [[Pope Clement VIII]], upon hearing of the Edict. The final two parts consisted of ''brevets'' ([[letters patent]]) which contained the military clauses and pastoral clauses. These two brevets were withdrawn in 1629 by [[Louis XIII]], following a final religious civil war.\n\nThe two [[letters patent]]<ref>Texts published in [[\u00c9lie Benoist|Benoist]] 1693 I:62\u201398 (noted by Rothrock).</ref> supplementing the Edict granted the Protestants<!--fifty or one hundred?--> safe havens (''places de s\u00fbret\u00e9''), which were military strongholds such as [[La Rochelle]], in support of which the king paid 180,000 [[\u00e9cu]]s a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (''places de refuge''), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an act of toleration was unusual in Western Europe,{{efn|For Eastern Europe, see [[Mehmed II#Mehmed II.27s Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans|Mehmed II's Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans]] or the [[Warsaw Confederation]].}} where standard practice forced subjects to follow the religion of their ruler \u2014 the application of the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.\n\nWhile it granted certain privileges to Huguenots, the edict upheld Catholicism's position as the established religion of France. Protestants gained no exemption from paying the [[tithe]]{{efn|The King engaged to support the Protestant ministers in part recompense.}} and had to respect [[feast day|Catholic holiday]]s and restrictions regarding marriage. The authorities limited Protestant freedom of worship to specified geographic areas. The Edict dealt only with Protestant and Catholic coexistence; it made no mention of [[Jew]]s, or of [[Muslim]]s, who were offered temporary asylum in France when the [[Moriscos]] were being expelled from Spain.{{efn|The ''ordonnance'' of 22 February 1610 stipulated that the emigr\u00e9s settle north of the [[Dordogne]] (safely away from the manipulations of Spanish agents) and that they embrace the Catholic faith; those who did not wish to do so were granted right of passage to French ports on the Mediterranean, to take ship for [[Barbary]].<ref>L. P. Harvey, ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614'', 2005:318</ref> By the time the ''ordonnance'' was published Henri IV had been assassinated.}}\n\nThe original Act which promulgated the Edict has disappeared. The ''[[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]]'' in Paris preserves only the text of a shorter document modified by concessions extracted from the King by the clergy and the [[Parlement of Paris]], which delayed ten months before finally signing and setting seals to the document in 1599. A copy of the first edict, sent for safekeeping to Protestant [[Geneva]], survives. The provincial [[parlement]]s resisted in their turn; the most recalcitrant, the parlement of Rouen, did not unreservedly register the Edict until 1609.<ref>Rothrock 1960:23 note 6.</ref>\n\nThe location of the signing is uncertain. The Edict itself states merely that it is \"given at [[Nantes]], in the month of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight\". By the late 19th century the Catholic tradition<ref>Reported in Baedeker, ''Northern France'', 1889.</ref> cited the signing in the \"Maison des Tourelles\", home of prosperous Spanish trader Andr\u00e9 Ruiz; it was destroyed by bombing in World War II.\n\n==Revocation==\n{{main|Edict of Fontainebleau}}\n[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|Louis XIV, by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]]]\nThe Edict remained unaltered in effect, registered by the parliaments as \"fundamental and irrevocable law,\" with the exception of the ''brevets,'' which had been granted for a period of eight years, and were renewed by Henry in 1606 and in 1611 by [[Marie de' Medici|Marie de M\u00e9decis]], who confirmed the Edict within a week of the assassination of Henry, stilling Protestant fears of another [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. The subsidies had been reduced by degrees, as Henry gained more control of the nation.<ref>A point made in Rothrock 1960:19.</ref> By the peace of Montpellier in 1622, concluding a Huguenot revolt in Languedoc, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two, [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]. The ''brevets'' were entirely withdrawn in 1629, by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], following the [[Siege of La Rochelle]], in which [[Cardinal Richelieu]] blockaded the city for fourteen months.\n\nDuring the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year, voiced in declarations and orders, and in case decisions in the Council, fluctuating according to the tides of domestic politics and the relations of France with powers abroad.<ref>Ruth Kleinman, \"Changing Interpretations of the Edict of Nantes: The Administrative Aspect, 1643\u20131661\" ''French Historical Studies'' '''10'''.4 (Autumn 1978:541\u2013571.</ref>\n\nIn October 1685, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. This act, commonly called the '''revocation of the Edict of Nantes'',' had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place.  All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country.  In spite of the prohibition, the persecution including many examples of torture caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1685revocation.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=www.fordham.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu/page/220 220] |url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu|url-access = registration |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref> Most moved to [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Huguenots in South Africa|South Africa]] and the [[New France|new French colonies]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America.<ref>See [[History of the French in Louisville]].</ref> This exodus deprived France of many of its most skilled and industrious individuals, some of whom thenceforward aided France's rivals in the Netherlands and in England. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes also further damaged the perception of Louis XIV abroad, making the Protestant nations bordering France even more hostile to his regime. Upon the revocation of the edict, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which encouraged Protestants to come to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].\n\nFreedom to worship and civil rights for non-Catholics in France were not restored until the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]], by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] 102 years later, on 7 November 1787. This edict was enacted by [[parlement]] two months later, less than two years before the end of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]] would fully eliminate religious discrimination in France.<ref>[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=2012-07-14 }}, downloaded 29 January 2012</ref>\n\n==Literal translation==\nThe principal and most salient provisions of Henry IV\u2019s Edict of Nantes, as promulgated at Nantes in Brittany probably on 30 April 1598, include:<ref>History Guide, [http://historyguide.org/earlymod/nantes.html The Edict of Nantes (1598)]</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>Henri, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:\n\nAmong the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom.  The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers.  God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety,\u2014peace for our state.  For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work....  We implore and await from the Divine Goodness the same protection and favor which he has ever granted to this kingdom from the beginning....\n\nWe have, by this perpetual and irrevocable edict, established and proclaimed and do establish and proclaim:\n\nI.  First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened....\n\nIII.  We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and re\u00ebstablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them....\n\nVI.  And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences, ...  upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict.\n\nVII.  It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses....\n\nIX.  We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgments to the contrary....\n\nXIII.  We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict.\n\nXIV.  It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city....\n\nXVIII.  We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity....\n\nXXI.  Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted.\n\nXXII.  We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats, and public charities.</poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Edict of Toleration]]\n*[[Freedom of religion]]\n*[[List of treaties]]\n*[[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]], a precursor to Henry IV\u2019s policies\n*[[Peace of Vervins]]\n*[[Warsaw Confederation (1573)]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\nThe source followed by most modern historians is the Huguenot refugee [[\u00c9lie Benoist]]'s ''Histoire de l'\u00e9dit de Nantes'', 3 vols.

His group's [[conga]]s and [[Bongo drum|bongos]] were decorated with their leader's own thematic drawings, as well. His interest in the culture later led him to [[Brazil]], home to the western hemisphere's largest population of [[Afro-Brazilian|African descent]]. P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was invited to exhibit some of this work by the Director of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Modern Art Museum of Paris]], [[Jean Cassou]], in 1956.

In 1960 they were invited by art critic [[Rafael Squirru]] to join the international exhibition at the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]] (of which he was creator and first director) with artists such as [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Roger Hilton]] and [[Lucio Fontana]]. The experimental tendencies of the Grupo de los 8 have since gained a place of unquestionable relevance not only in the panorama of Uruguayan art but also at an international level, some of their works forming part of museums and collections worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=Requires citation to a source for what's stated here}}\n\nIncreasingly well-known, P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was commissioned in 1959 to create a mural for a tunnel connecting a new annex to the [[Organization of American States]]' [[Washington, DC]] headquarters, the Pan American Union building.

Returning to Montevideo in the late 1940s, he developed an interest in [[Afro-Uruguayan]] culture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Settling in Montevideo's primarily black neighbourhood of \"Mediomundo\" (\"Half-World\"), he studied the [[Candombe|Candomb\u00e9]] and [[Comparsa]] dances characteristic to the culture.<ref>[http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 Artist's bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911192328/http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 |date=September 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHe composed numerous musical pieces in the two genres and conducted an orchestra. His group's [[conga]]s and [[Bongo drum|bongos]] were decorated with their leader's own thematic drawings, as well. His interest in the culture later led him to [[Brazil]], home to the western hemisphere's largest population of [[Afro-Brazilian|African descent]]. P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was invited to exhibit some of this work by the Director of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Modern Art Museum of Paris]], [[Jean Cassou]], in 1956. He traveled to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], later that year - his first visit to Africa.<ref name=lanacion>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=537743 ''La Naci\u00f3n'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nHe was one of the \"Grupo de los 8\", a movement of Uruguayan artists formed in 1958 together with Oscar Garc\u00eda Reino, Miguel \u00c1ngel Pareja, Ra\u00fal Pavlovsky, Lincoln Presno, Am\u00e9rico Sposito, Alfredo Testoni and Julio Verdie in order to promote new tendencies in painting. In 1960 they were invited by art critic [[Rafael Squirru]] to join the international exhibition at the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]] (of which he was creator and first director) with artists such as [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Roger Hilton]] and [[Lucio Fontana]]. The experimental tendencies of the Grupo de los 8 have since gained a place of unquestionable relevance not only in the panorama of Uruguayan art but also at an international level, some of their works forming part of museums and collections worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly well-known, P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was commissioned in 1959 to create a mural for a tunnel connecting a new annex to the [[Organization of American States]]' [[Washington, DC]] headquarters, the Pan American Union building. Originally intended to be no more than {{convert|15|m}} in length, the completed mural (''Roots of Peace'') measured {{convert|155|m}} long and nearly {{convert|2|m}} high when unveiled in 1960.
