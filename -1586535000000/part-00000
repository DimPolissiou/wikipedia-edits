SpaceX is defined as a private space company and thus its achievements can also be counted as firsts by a private company. \n\nLandmark achievements of SpaceX in chronological order include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaabot.com/8479/rise-rise-spacex/ |title=The Rise and Rise of SpaceX| author=Mir Juned Hussain |publisher=Yaabot |accessdate=March 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n* The first privately funded liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit ([[Falcon 1#Fourth flight|Falcon 1 flight 4]] on 28 September 2008)\n* The first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit ([[RazakSAT]] on Falcon 1 flight 5 on 14 July 2009)\n* The first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft ([[SpaceX Dragon]] on [[SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1|COTS Demo Flight 1]] on 9 December 2010)\n* The first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station ([[Dragon C2+]] on 25 May 2012)\n* The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit ([[SES-8]] on Falcon 9 flight 7 on 3 December 2013)\n* The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on land ([[Falcon 9 flight 20]] on 22 December 2015)\n* The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on an ocean platform ([[Falcon 9 flight 23]] on 8 April 2016)\n* The first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket stage ([[B1021]] on [[Falcon 9 flight 32]] on 30 March 2017)<ref name=\":2\"/>\n* The first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing (Falcon 9 flight 32 on 30 March 2017)<ref name=\"fairingrec\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/01/spacex-nose-cone-falcon9/ |title=SpaceX, In Another First, Recovers $6 Million Nose Cone From Reused Falcon 9|publisher=Fortune.com|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n* The first reflight of a commercial cargo spacecraft.

SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short period, and the spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to and from the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn late June 2015, [[SpaceX CRS-7|CRS-7]] launched a [[SpaceX Dragon|Cargo Dragon]] atop a [[Falcon 9]] to resupply the [[International Space Station]]. All [[telemetry]] readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight, when a loss of helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly for a few seconds before disintegrating due to [[Dynamic pressure|aerodynamic forces]].

There was concern on the part of ''Nature's'' editorial oversight board that the material, if published, would lend credibility to homeopathic practitioners even if the effects were not replicable.<ref name=\"time\" /> There was equal concern that the research was simply wrong, given the changes that it would demand of the known laws of physics and chemistry. The editor of ''Nature'', [[John Maddox]], stated that, \"Our minds were not so much closed as unready to change our whole view of how science is constructed.\"<ref name=\"time\" /> Rejecting the paper on any objective grounds was deemed unsupportable, as there were no methodological flaws apparent at the time.\n\nIn the end, a compromise was reached. The paper was published in ''Nature'' Vol. 333 on 30 June 1988,<ref name=\"benveniste\" /> but it was accompanied with an editorial by Maddox that noted \"There are good and particular reasons why prudent people should, for the time being, suspend judgement\" and described some of the fundamental laws of chemistry and physics which it would violate, if shown to be true.<ref name=NatureEditorial /> Additionally, Maddox demanded that the experiments be re-run under the supervision of a hand-picked group of what became known as \"ghostbusters\", including Maddox, famed magician and paranormal researcher [[James Randi]], and [[Walter W. Stewart (chemist)|Walter W.

Maddox, however, noted that during the procedure the experimenters were aware of which test tubes originally contained the antibodies and which did not. Benveniste's team then started a second, blinded experimental series with Maddox and his team in charge of the [[double-blind experiment|double-blinding]]: notebooks were photographed, the lab videotaped, and vials juggled and secretly coded.

In his ''Nature'' letter, Benveniste also implied that Randi was attempting to hoodwink the experimental run by doing magic tricks, \"distracting the technician in charge of its supervision!\" He was more apologetic on ''Quirks and Quarks'', re-phrasing his mention of Randi to imply that he had kept the team ''amused'' with his tricks and that his presence was generally welcomed. He also pointed out that although it was true two of his team members were being paid by a homeopathic company, the same company had paid Maddox's team's hotel bill.\n\nMaddox was unapologetic, stating \"I'm sorry we didn't find something more interesting.\" On the same ''Quirks and Quarks'' show he dismissed Benveniste's complaints, stating that because of the possibility that the results would be unduly promoted by the homeopathy community, an immediate re-test was necessary. The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the [[Observer-expectancy effect|experimenter effect]]. He also pointed out that the entire test procedure that Benveniste later complained about was one that had been agreed upon in advance by all parties.

One of Benveniste's co-authors on the ''Nature'' paper, Francis Beauvais, later stated that while unblinded experimental trials usually yielded \"correct\" results (''i.e.'' ultradiluted samples were biologically active, controls were not), \"the results of blinded samples were almost always at random and did not fit the expected results: some 'controls' were active and some 'active' samples were without effect on the biological system.\"<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WXX-4RJXWNR-D&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=12&_fmt=full&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%237170%232008%23999029998%23678364%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=7170&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=26&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=075658aa100e80c6756d88574a4d38bd Memory of water and blinding]{{dead link|date=March 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Francis Beauvais, ''Homeopathy'', 97(1):41-42, January 2008.</ref>\n\n==Subsequent research==\n\nIn the [[cold fusion]] or [[polywater]] controversies many scientists started replications immediately, because the underlying theories did not go directly against scientific fundamental principles and could be accommodated with a few tweaks to those principles.<ref name=\"ball\" /> But Benveniste's experiment went directly against several principles, causing most researchers to outright reject the results as errors or fabrication, with only a few researchers willing to perform replications or experiments that could validate or reject his hypotheses.<ref name=\"ball\">{{citation |title= Life's matrix: a biography of water |author= Philip Ball |edition= illustrated, reprinted |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-520-23008-8 |page= 328 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vPVdHwpkfu0C |author-link= Philip Ball }}</ref>\n\nAfter the ''Nature'' controversy, Benveniste gained the public support of [[Brian David Josephson|Brian Josephson]],<ref>Brian Josephson, [http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/water.memory/ns/homeopathy.html molecule memories], ''New Scientist'' letters, 1 November 1997</ref> a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist with a reputation for openness to paranormal claims.

By contrast, the notion of \"memory of water\" has been taken seriously among [[homeopathy|homeopaths]]. For them, it seemed to be part of a possible explanation of why some of their remedies might work. \nAn overview of the issues surrounding the memory of water was the subject of a special issue of ''Homeopathy.'' In an editorial, the editor of ''Homeopathy'',  [[Peter_Fisher_(physician)|Peter Fisher]], acknowledged that Benveniste\u2019s original method does not yield reproducible results and declared  \"...the memory of water is a bad memory: it casts a long shadow over homeopathy and is just about all that many scientists recall about the scientific investigation of homeopathy, equating it with poor or even fraudulent science.\"  The issue was an attempt to restore some credibility to the notion with articles proposing various, very different theories of water memory, such as: electromagnetic exchange of information between molecules, breaking of temporal symmetry, thermoluminescence, entanglement described by a new quantum theory, formation of hydrogen peroxide, clathrate formation, etc. Some of the proposed mechanisms would require overthrowing much of 20th century physics.<ref name=\"Homeopathy2007\">{{citation\n | editor = Martin Chaplin\n | date = 2007\n | title = The Memory of Water ''Homeopathy'' 96:141-230}} \n::Copies of the articles in this special issue are freely available on a private website, along with discussion.

Built by [[Sauber]] as a successor to the [[Sauber C9]], the C11 used the same [[Mercedes-Benz M119 engine|Mercedes-Benz M119]] 5.0L twin turbo V8.  It was the first time that Mercedes-Benz chose to put their name on the car, instead of simply using Sauber.\n\n==Development==\n\nFollowing on the success of the Sauber C9, the Mercedes-Benz C11 was the last Group C prototype built by the Sauber Mercedes team before the introduction of the 3.5 litre category. Whereas, the C9 chassis had been constructed mostly from aluminium, the C11 was built from carbon fibre. The chassis was designed from scratch by Leo Ress, who had been with the team since the days of the [[Sauber C7]], and the first example was built by local Swiss firm Nobrac (\"carbon\" spelt backwards).<ref>Motorsport Magazine, April 1990</ref> The remainder were built by DPS Composites in Surrey, UK whose principal, Dave Price, was also a team manager at Sauber. The new chassis was designed for more downforce with a lower frontal area. At 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph) it generated {{convert|5,879|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of downforce, about {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} more than the C9 at the same speed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael J. Fuller |url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/aerodatabasemercedesc11.html |title=Mulsanne's Corner Race Car Aerodynamics Database: 1990 Mercedes-Benz C11 |publisher=Mulsannescorner.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-23}}</ref> Unlike the Sauber C9, the new C11 did not have a low downforce/low drag configuration for Le Mans, that race not being a part of the championship season in 1990. The whole car was considerably slimmer in appearance than its older sibling and was both lighter and stiffer. Ballast was added to bring its minimum weight up to the required {{convert|900|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} with an extra 5 kilograms added for safety. Particular attention was paid to air entry and exit points around the wheel arches and the airflow through the cockpit was improved for driver comfort. The development program also included the use of a rolling road wind tunnel which was unique for [[Group C]] at the time.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990\">MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990</ref><ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010\">MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010</ref>\n\nA new Mercedes 5-speed [[transaxle]] was designed with the rear suspension in mind and the previous longitudinal spring/damper design of the C9 was abandoned in favour of a transverse layout, actuated by push rods. This allowed for a better integrated rear end that was much stiffer than before, according to designer Leo Ress.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010\"/> The front suspension remained similar to the older car with inboard transverse coil spring/damper units actuated by push rods. The brakes were Brembo and tyres were switched from Michelin to Goodyear.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990\"/>\n\nThe 5 litre, twin-turbo Mercedes-Benz M119 engine was retained from the older car and was sourced directly from the Mercedes engine facility at [[Untert\u00fcrkheim]]. It was developed by Willi Muller and Gerd Witthalm and was returned to Stuttgart after every race, the transmission remaining at the Sauber facility at Hinwil.

[[Group C]] [[Le Mans Prototype|prototype]] race car introduced for the [[1990 World Sports-Prototype Championship]].  Built by [[Sauber]] as a successor to the [[Sauber C9]], the C11 used the same [[Mercedes-Benz M119 engine|Mercedes-Benz M119]] 5.0L twin turbo V8.  It was the first time that Mercedes-Benz chose to put their name on the car, instead of simply using Sauber.\n\n==Development==\n\nFollowing on the success of the Sauber C9, the Mercedes-Benz C11 was the last Group C prototype built by the Sauber Mercedes team before the introduction of the 3.5 litre category. Whereas, the C9 chassis had been constructed mostly from aluminium, the C11 was built from carbon fibre. The chassis was designed from scratch by Leo Ress, who had been with the team since the days of the [[Sauber C7]], and the first example was built by local Swiss firm Nobrac (\"carbon\" spelt backwards).<ref>Motorsport Magazine, April 1990</ref> The remainder were built by DPS Composites in Surrey, UK whose principal, Dave Price, was also a team manager at Sauber. The new chassis was designed for more downforce with a lower frontal area. At 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph) it generated {{convert|5,879|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of downforce, about {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} more than the C9 at the same speed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael J. Fuller |url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/aerodatabasemercedesc11.html |title=Mulsanne's Corner Race Car Aerodynamics Database: 1990 Mercedes-Benz C11 |publisher=Mulsannescorner.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-23}}</ref> Unlike the Sauber C9, the new C11 did not have a low downforce/low drag configuration for Le Mans, that race not being a part of the championship season in 1990. The whole car was considerably slimmer in appearance than its older sibling and was both lighter and stiffer. Ballast was added to bring its minimum weight up to the required {{convert|900|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} with an extra 5 kilograms added for safety. Particular attention was paid to air entry and exit points around the wheel arches and the airflow through the cockpit was improved for driver comfort. The development program also included the use of a rolling road wind tunnel which was unique for [[Group C]] at the time.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990\">MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990</ref><ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010\">MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010</ref>\n\nA new Mercedes 5-speed [[transaxle]] was designed with the rear suspension in mind and the previous longitudinal spring/damper design of the C9 was abandoned in favour of a transverse layout, actuated by push rods. This allowed for a better integrated rear end that was much stiffer than before, according to designer Leo Ress.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, January, 2010\"/> The front suspension remained similar to the older car with inboard transverse coil spring/damper units actuated by push rods. The brakes were Brembo and tyres were switched from Michelin to Goodyear.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990\"/>\n\nThe 5 litre, twin-turbo Mercedes-Benz M119 engine was retained from the older car and was sourced directly from the Mercedes engine facility at [[Untert\u00fcrkheim]]. It was developed by Willi Muller and Gerd Witthalm and was returned to Stuttgart after every race, the transmission remaining at the Sauber facility at Hinwil. In race trim, it was tuned to produce around {{cvt|720|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}, which gave the best combination of power and efficiency for Group C, which was a fuel allocation formula.<ref name=\"MotorSport Magazine, April, 1990\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nSauber had planned to build four C11 chassis and have enough spares for a fifth if needed.

After the introduction of the [[Toyota Tundra]] in 1999, speculation started that Toyota intended to compete in the full-size market with a Tundra-based SUV called the Highlander. However, the Highlander name was used on a [[Toyota Highlander|midsize Camry-based crossover]] and the Tundra-based SUV was introduced on January 11, 2000 at the North American Auto Show as the '''Toyota Sequoia''', with full production starting in September 2000 for the 2001 model year.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis are shared with the Tundra, with the exception of rear [[disc brake]]s and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J100)|Land Cruiser]], larger than the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] in most dimensions and similar in size to the [[Ford Expedition]]; its V8 engine was certified as an [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]]. Frame assemblies and driveshafts are produced by [[Dana Holding Corporation]].\n\nThe Sequoia came in two trim levels: ''SR5'' and ''Limited''. The base ''SR5'' started at $32,820 while the more expensive ''Limited'' started at $41,855. It was sold in both [[two-wheel drive]] and [[four-wheel drive]] versions.

A new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] equipped with [[VVT-i]] was new for 2005, as well as a 5-speed [[automatic transmission]], replacing the previous 4-speed. 4 wheel drive models got a Torsen center differential, replacing the previous open differential, that splits power in full-time mode 40% front and 60% rear under normal driving, and can send up to 53% to the front and 71% to the rear during slip.

After the introduction of the [[Toyota Tundra]] in 1999, speculation started that Toyota intended to compete in the full-size market with a Tundra-based SUV called the Highlander. However, the Highlander name was used on a [[Toyota Highlander|midsize Camry-based crossover]] and the Tundra-based SUV was introduced on January 11, 2000 at the North American Auto Show as the '''Toyota Sequoia''', with full production starting in September 2000 for the 2001 model year.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis are shared with the Tundra, with the exception of rear [[disc brake]]s and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J100)|Land Cruiser]], larger than the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] in most dimensions and similar in size to the [[Ford Expedition]]; its V8 engine was certified as an [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]]. Frame assemblies and driveshafts are produced by [[Dana Holding Corporation]].\n\nThe Sequoia came in two trim levels: ''SR5'' and ''Limited''. The base ''SR5'' started at $32,820 while the more expensive ''Limited'' started at $41,855. It was sold in both [[two-wheel drive]] and [[four-wheel drive]] versions. [[Vehicle Stability Control]] was standard on all models.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=Iihs-Hldi |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=2010-04-07 }}</ref>\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:2005-2007 Toyota Sequoia Limited.jpg|thumb|left|2005\u20132007 Toyota Sequoia Limited]]\nFor the 2005 model year, the Sequoia received a minor facelift. A new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] equipped with [[VVT-i]] was new for 2005, as well as a 5-speed [[automatic transmission]], replacing the previous 4-speed. 4 wheel drive models got a Torsen center differential, replacing the previous open differential, that splits power in full-time mode 40% front and 60% rear under normal driving, and can send up to 53% to the front and 71% to the rear during slip.

Pricing ranges from about $34,000 to $55,000 depending upon the trim line and configuration.\nThe base engine is the previous ULEV compliant 4.7&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UZ engine#2UZ-FE|2UZ-FE]]'' {{convert|276|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] featured from the previous generation. The 4.7&nbsp;L is standard on the SR5, while the Limited and Platinum models come standard with a 5.7&nbsp;L V8 engine. Four-wheel drive is available on all models.\n\nThe interior of the 2008 Sequoia features the same dash as the new Tundra. Standard features include a tilt and telescopic steering wheel, power windows and doors, dual sun visors, and a [[keyless entry]].  Options include DVD based [[automotive navigation system|navigation]] with [[backup camera]] and 7\" screen, a rear DVD entertainment system, a 14-speaker JBL audio system, and heated seats with ventilated coolers in the front row and warmers in the second row, available in Platinum trim. The Limited trim includes audio, climate, and hands-free [[Bluetooth]] mobile phone system controls, an improved [[JBL (company)|JBL]] audio system, [[electroluminescent]] Optitron gauges, and an [[electrochromic]] [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|auto-dimming rear-view mirror]] and side view mirrors with a [[HomeLink]] transceiver. The Platinum model includes a standard DVD navigation with a backup camera, a rear [[air suspension]] which can lower for easy loading, and [[Dynamic Laser Cruise Control]].\n\nSeating arrangements are for seven or eight passengers, eight for SR5 and Limited models and seven for Platinum models.

Recently, the Sequoia, along with the Tacoma and Tundra, have another recall due to the frame prematurely rusting.  If there is a 10 mm perforation found on the frame, the vehicle frame will be replaced, if the service is done within 12 years of vehicle purchase or 1 year after recall became official.  For those vehicles without 10 mm perforation and located in a cold weather state, Toyota will perform an undercoating service to prevent future rust from forming.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/vehicle_gallery/suvs/sequoia/ Toyota Sequoia global site]\n* [http://www.toyota.com/sequoia/ 2nd generation Toyota Sequoia SUV site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160816095605/http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/minisite/sequoia/prelaunch/content/sequoia_press_release.pdf] Toyota press release detailing the launch of the 2008 Sequoia at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160816072801/http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/future/sequoia/pdf/08MYSequoiaPricing.pdf] Toyota's official pricing announcement of the 2008 Toyota Sequoia.\n\n{{Modern North American Toyota trucks}}\n{{Toyota Motor Corporation}}\n\n[[Category:Toyota vehicles|Sequoia]]\n[[Category:Sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Full-size sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:2020s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSafety:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2010-2016 \u2192 2010\u20132016", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Sequoia"}

It is the fourth entry in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series and an indirect sequel to ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena]]''. In North America, ''Armored Core 2'' was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. A direct sequel, ''[[Armored Core 2: Another Age]]'', was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2. \n\nThe story takes place almost 70 years after ''Master of Arena''. Following the colonization of [[Mars]], a powerful organization called the Frighteners overthrows the government at the behest of their leader, the enigmatic Leos Klein. The player is a mercenary who is tasked with dismantling the Frighteners and defeating Klein. \n\n''Armored Core 2''<nowiki/>'s gameplay is largely similar to that of its predecessors. Players take control of powerful machines called Armored Cores and engage in dangerous missions or fight in the Arena against other pilots. Like earlier games, ''Armored Core 2'' features a local multiplayer mode that includes a console linking feature and allows two players to fight each other with their own custom Armored Core.\n== Gameplay ==\n''Armored Core 2'' is a third-person shooter in which players pilot machines called Armored Cores. These Cores can be fully customized with different parts, weapons, and paint schemes to create a unique loadout.<ref name=gamerev/> Players must balance their loadout to ensure that they aren't too heavy or are using too much power. In order to purchase more parts, players must earn credits through missions or the Arena.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gamepro/>\n\nMissions are largely unchanged from the original ''Armored Core''. Players are given an objective to complete in open levels and can complete the objective however they choose. Enemies can consist of automated machines called MTs, mysterious unmanned weapons called Disorders, or other Armored Core pilots. Upon completion, repair and ammunition costs are deducted from the reward payout. If a player fails a mission, those costs are directly deducted from their overall balance.<ref name=ign/>\n\nThe Arena is a largely freeform gamemode that the player can enter at any time. At the start of the game, the player is ranked at the bottom of a 50-person ladder and must fight their way to the top.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gspot/> Some ranked pilots can be killed over the course of the story missions and removed from the ladder. As players win, they can earn credits or parts for their victories that can be used in both the Arena and story missions.<ref name=gspot/>\n\nIn addition to missions and the Arena, a local multiplayer mode allows players to fight their friends via split screen or console linking with a Sony I-link Fire Wire cable.<ref name=gamerev/> While split screen only requires one copy of the game, console linking requires two copies, along with two separate consoles and two televisions. Console linking allows for a larger number of location options in the game mode. Players with existing saves can load their custom Armored Core into these multiplayer matches.<ref name=gamepro/>\n\n==Plot==\n67 years after ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena|Master of Arena]]'', [[Earth|Earth's]] second largest corporation, Zio Matrix, acquires plans for a research project on [[Mars]], dating back before the Great Destruction. Using these plans, Zio Matrix sends a research team to Mars to begin the [[Terraforming]] Project, which causes the Martian surface and atmosphere to approximate that of Earth. Other corporations learn of the project and quickly follow Zio Matrix, bringing with them the competitive environment that existed on Earth, and the employ of the mercenaries of Nerves Concord.\n\nAs the three companies' war comes to a close, Zio Matrix attempts a coup against the government, which has regained control through its elite mercenary team, The Frighteners, led by Leos Klein. But in the chaos that ensues, the Frighteners turn on the government, assassinate its leader, and take control of powerful technology. The player character is tasked with confronting them and saving the human populace of Mars.\n\n== Release ==\n''Armored Core 2'' was initially released in [[Japan]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] on August 3, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/detail.html?csm=015|title=Armored Core 2 {{!}} FromSoftware|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fromsoftware.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> [[FromSoftware]] partnered with [[Agetec]] and released a [[North America|North American]] version on October 26, 2000 as a launch title for the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/28/the-ps2-launch-titles|title=The PS2 Launch Titles|author=IGN staff|date=October 27, 2000|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref> A [[Europe|European]] version was released in partnership with [[Ubisoft]] on March 23, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/35329/Armored-Core-2/|title=Armored Core 2 -

It is the fourth entry in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series and an indirect sequel to ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena]]''. In North America, ''Armored Core 2'' was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. A direct sequel, ''[[Armored Core 2: Another Age]]'', was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2. \n\nThe story takes place almost 70 years after ''Master of Arena''. Following the colonization of [[Mars]], a powerful organization called the Frighteners overthrows the government at the behest of their leader, the enigmatic Leos Klein. The player is a mercenary who is tasked with dismantling the Frighteners and defeating Klein. \n\n''Armored Core 2''<nowiki/>'s gameplay is largely similar to that of its predecessors. Players take control of powerful machines called Armored Cores and engage in dangerous missions or fight in the Arena against other pilots. Like earlier games, ''Armored Core 2'' features a local multiplayer mode that includes a console linking feature and allows two players to fight each other with their own custom Armored Core.\n== Gameplay ==\n''Armored Core 2'' is a third-person shooter in which players pilot machines called Armored Cores. These Cores can be fully customized with different parts, weapons, and paint schemes to create a unique loadout.<ref name=gamerev/> Players must balance their loadout to ensure that they aren't too heavy or are using too much power. In order to purchase more parts, players must earn credits through missions or the Arena.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gamepro/>\n\nMissions are largely unchanged from the original ''Armored Core''. Players are given an objective to complete in open levels and can complete the objective however they choose. Enemies can consist of automated machines called MTs, mysterious unmanned weapons called Disorders, or other Armored Core pilots. Upon completion, repair and ammunition costs are deducted from the reward payout. If a player fails a mission, those costs are directly deducted from their overall balance.<ref name=ign/>\n\nThe Arena is a largely freeform gamemode that the player can enter at any time. At the start of the game, the player is ranked at the bottom of a 50-person ladder and must fight their way to the top.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gspot/> Some ranked pilots can be killed over the course of the story missions and removed from the ladder. As players win, they can earn credits or parts for their victories that can be used in both the Arena and story missions.<ref name=gspot/>\n\nIn addition to missions and the Arena, a local multiplayer mode allows players to fight their friends via split screen or console linking with a Sony I-link Fire Wire cable.<ref name=gamerev/> While split screen only requires one copy of the game, console linking requires two copies, along with two separate consoles and two televisions. Console linking allows for a larger number of location options in the game mode. Players with existing saves can load their custom Armored Core into these multiplayer matches.<ref name=gamepro/>\n\n==Plot==\n67 years after ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena|Master of Arena]]'', [[Earth|Earth's]] second largest corporation, Zio Matrix, acquires plans for a research project on [[Mars]], dating back before the Great Destruction. Using these plans, Zio Matrix sends a research team to Mars to begin the [[Terraforming]] Project, which causes the Martian surface and atmosphere to approximate that of Earth. Other corporations learn of the project and quickly follow Zio Matrix, bringing with them the competitive environment that existed on Earth, and the employ of the mercenaries of Nerves Concord.\n\nAs the three companies' war comes to a close, Zio Matrix attempts a coup against the government, which has regained control through its elite mercenary team, The Frighteners, led by Leos Klein. But in the chaos that ensues, the Frighteners turn on the government, assassinate its leader, and take control of powerful technology. The player character is tasked with confronting them and saving the human populace of Mars.\n\n== Release ==\n''Armored Core 2'' was initially released in [[Japan]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] on August 3, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/detail.html?csm=015|title=Armored Core 2 {{!}} FromSoftware|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fromsoftware.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> [[FromSoftware]] partnered with [[Agetec]] and released a [[North America|North American]] version on October 26, 2000 as a launch title for the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/28/the-ps2-launch-titles|title=The PS2 Launch Titles|author=IGN staff|date=October 27, 2000|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref> A [[Europe|European]] version was released in partnership with [[Ubisoft]] on March 23, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/35329/Armored-Core-2/|title=Armored Core 2 -
