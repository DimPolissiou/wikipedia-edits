The spread spectrum LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by multiple chirps of information. The rate at which the spread information is sent is referred to as the symbol rate, the ratio between the nominal symbol rate and chirp rate is the spreading factor (SF) and represents the number of symbols sent per bit of information.<ref name=\"modbas\" /> LoRa can trade off data rate for sensitivity with a fixed channel bandwidth by selecting the amount of spread used (a selectable radio parameter from 7 to 12). Lower SF means more chirps are sent per second; hence, you can encode more data per second. Higher SF implies fewer chirps per second; hence, there are fewer data to encode per second. Compared to lower SF, sending the same amount of data with higher SF needs more transmission time, known as airtime. More airtime means that the modem is up and running longer and consuming more energy. The benefit of high SF is that more extended airtime gives the receiver more opportunities to sample the signal power which results in better sensitivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/how-spreading-factor-affects-lorawan-device-battery-life|title=How Spreading Factor affects LoRaWAN device battery life|last=Qoitech|website=The Things Network|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, LoRa uses [[Forward error correction|Forward Error Correction coding]] to improve resilience against interference. LoRa's high range is characterized by high wireless [[link budget]]s of around 155&nbsp;dB to 170&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.semtech.com/title-10-things-about-lorawan-nb-iot|title=10 Things About LoRaWAN & NB-IoT|last=Mohan|first=Vivek|website=blog.semtech.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==LoRaWAN==\nSince LoRa defines the lower physical layer, the upper networking layers were lacking. LoRaWAN is one of several protocols that were developed to define the upper layers of the network. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based [[medium access control]] (MAC) layer protocol but acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication between [[LPWAN]] [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] and end-node devices as a routing protocol, maintained by the LoRa Alliance.\n\nLoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, [[Data-rate units|data rate]], and power for all devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers|title=LoRaWAN For Developers|website=www.lora-alliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send.

The spread spectrum LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by multiple chirps of information. The rate at which the spread information is sent is referred to as the symbol rate, the ratio between the nominal symbol rate and chirp rate is the spreading factor (SF) and represents the number of symbols sent per bit of information.<ref name=\"modbas\" /> LoRa can trade off data rate for sensitivity with a fixed channel bandwidth by selecting the amount of spread used (a selectable radio parameter from 7 to 12). Lower SF means more chirps are sent per second; hence, you can encode more data per second. Higher SF implies fewer chirps per second; hence, there are fewer data to encode per second. Compared to lower SF, sending the same amount of data with higher SF needs more transmission time, known as airtime. More airtime means that the modem is up and running longer and consuming more energy. The benefit of high SF is that more extended airtime gives the receiver more opportunities to sample the signal power which results in better sensitivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/how-spreading-factor-affects-lorawan-device-battery-life|title=How Spreading Factor affects LoRaWAN device battery life|last=Qoitech|website=The Things Network|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, LoRa uses [[Forward error correction|Forward Error Correction coding]] to improve resilience against interference. LoRa's high range is characterized by high wireless [[link budget]]s of around 155&nbsp;dB to 170&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.semtech.com/title-10-things-about-lorawan-nb-iot|title=10 Things About LoRaWAN & NB-IoT|last=Mohan|first=Vivek|website=blog.semtech.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==LoRaWAN==\nSince LoRa defines the lower physical layer, the upper networking layers were lacking. LoRaWAN is one of several protocols that were developed to define the upper layers of the network. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based [[medium access control]] (MAC) layer protocol but acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication between [[LPWAN]] [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] and end-node devices as a routing protocol, maintained by the LoRa Alliance.\n\nLoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, [[Data-rate units|data rate]], and power for all devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers|title=LoRaWAN For Developers|website=www.lora-alliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=McGillBeginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\n[[File:McDonald Engineering Building, McGill University, Montreal, QC, about 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|The old [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering#Buildings & Laboratories|Macdonald Engineering Building]], the School of Architecture's original home.]]\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (1894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students. Nobbs divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building was damaged by fire in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

Nobbs divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building was damaged by fire in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|Second World War]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment.
