A man follows Conan from the tavern before hiring him to obtain a mysterious and valuable relic. Outfitting himself with the initial payment, Conan travels to the city of Sicas in Aquilonia. Once renowned for its silver mines but now a den of iniquity, more travelers are said to leave Sicas \"by the river, floating,\" than through the gates. On the way, he rescues a woman searching for her missing sister, said to have gone into the same place.\n\nSicas turns out to be in the midst of a conflict between numerous contenders for control, most notably the king's corrupt servants, five different gangs, and a religious cult. Conan feels right at home, and plunges into the struggle. Various intrigues and betrayals follow in rapid succession, centering on the object he has been commissioned to recover, which is revealed to be a potent magical artifact. The rising tension in Sicas results in an all out major brawl near the middle of town between local gangs and various power players. In contrast to most of the players, Conan emerges from Sicas ahead of the game, passing by royal forces en route to restore order in the city.

On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789\u20131901#1841 to 1851|Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846]], to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President [[James K.

The voters in the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116, while those in the rest of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in rural Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer.

On August 17, 1861, an armed force of 600 Confederate soldiers engaged the 23rd New York Infantry near that crossroads, killing one. Another large incursion on August 27 involved between 600 and 800 Confederate soldiers, which clashed with Union soldiers at Ball's Crossroads, Hall's Hill and along the modern-day border between the City of Falls Church and Arlington. A number of soldiers on both sides were killed.

Because of the confusion between the city and the county having the same name, a movement started to rename Alexandria County. In 1920, the name '''Arlington County''' was adopted, after [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the home of the [[American Civil War]] Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]], which stands on the grounds of what is now [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The [[Potomac, Virginia|Town of Potomac]] was incorporated as a town in Alexandria County in 1908. The town was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in 1930.\n\nIn 1896, an electric trolley line was built from Washington through Ballston, which led to growth in the county (see [[Northern Virginia trolleys]]).\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Seal of Arlington County, Virginia (1983\u20132007).png|thumb|upright|left|The former Arlington County seal, used from June 1983 to May 2007]]\n\nIn 1920, the Virginia legislature renamed the area Arlington County to avoid confusion with the City of Alexandria which had become an [[independent city]] in 1870 under the new Virginia Constitution adopted after the Civil War.\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Hoover Field]] was established on the present site of the Pentagon; in that decade, Buckingham, Colonial Village, and other apartment communities also opened.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in 1954, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka'', Kansas had struck down the previous ruling on racial segregation ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' that held that facilities could be racially \"separate but equal.\" ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruled that \"racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal.\" The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools. The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation. Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation. Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958\u201359 academic year. In January 1959 both the U.S. District Court and the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled against Virginia's [[massive resistance]] movement, which opposed racial integration.<ref>Les Shaver, \"Crossing the Divide: The Desegregation of Stratford Junior High,\" ''Arlington Magazine'' November/December 2013, pp. 62\u201371</ref> The Arlington County Central Library's collections include written materials as well as accounts in its Oral History Project of the desegregation struggle in the county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/virginiana-collection/|title=Virginiana Collection|publisher=Arlington Public Library |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:US Navy 061013-F-3500C-443 View over the U.S. Navy Annex, showing the completed U.S. Air Force memorial.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The former [[Navy Annex]] and the [[United States Air Force Memorial|Air Force Memorial]]]]\nArlington during the 1960s was undergoing tremendous change after the huge influx of newcomers in the 1950s.

Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.<ref>Kevin Craft, \"When Metro Came to Town: How the fight for mass transit was won.

Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.\n\nArlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a \"treasury\" of Washington heirlooms.\n\nIn 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.\n\nWhen George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].\n\nThe U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.\n\nVeterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.\n\nThe [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an \"Eternal Flame.\" His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.\n\nOther frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the \"Iwo Jima Memorial\", the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].\n\n===The Pentagon===\n[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|The Pentagon, looking northeast with the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington Monument]] in the distance.]]\n\n{{Main|The Pentagon}}\n[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943 and it is the world's largest office building. Although it is located in Arlington, the [[United States Postal Service]] requires that \"Washington, D.C.\" be used as the place name in mail addressed to the six [[ZIP code]]s assigned to The Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html |title=Facts & Figures: Zip Codes |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311141422/http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html|archivedate=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe building is [[pentagon]]-shaped and houses about 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel. It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.\n\nBuilt during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has {{convert|17.5|mi|abbr=on}} of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.\n\nIt was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m\u00b3) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.\n\nThe open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest \"no-salute, no-cover\" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].\n\nDuring World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943 and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transportation==\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect [[Transportation in Arlington County, Virginia]] -->\n[[File:2019-06-26 11 51 06 View south along Interstate 395 (Henry G.

On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789\u20131901#1841 to 1851|Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846]], to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President [[James K.

The voters in the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116, while those in the rest of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in rural Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer.

Because of the confusion between the city and the county having the same name, a movement started to rename Alexandria County. In 1920, the name '''Arlington County''' was adopted, after [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the home of the [[American Civil War]] Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]], which stands on the grounds of what is now [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The [[Potomac, Virginia|Town of Potomac]] was incorporated as a town in Alexandria County in 1908. The town was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in 1930.\n\nIn 1896, an electric trolley line was built from Washington through Ballston, which led to growth in the county (see [[Northern Virginia trolleys]]).\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Seal of Arlington County, Virginia (1983\u20132007).png|thumb|upright|left|The former Arlington County seal, used from June 1983 to May 2007]]\n\nIn 1920, the Virginia legislature renamed the area Arlington County to avoid confusion with the City of Alexandria which had become an [[independent city]] in 1870 under the new Virginia Constitution adopted after the Civil War.\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Hoover Field]] was established on the present site of the Pentagon; in that decade, Buckingham, Colonial Village, and other apartment communities also opened.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in 1954, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka'', Kansas had struck down the previous ruling on racial segregation ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' that held that facilities could be racially \"separate but equal.\" ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruled that \"racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal.\" The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools. The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation. Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation. Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958\u201359 academic year. In January 1959 both the U.S. District Court and the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled against Virginia's [[massive resistance]] movement, which opposed racial integration.<ref>Les Shaver, \"Crossing the Divide: The Desegregation of Stratford Junior High,\" ''Arlington Magazine'' November/December 2013, pp. 62\u201371</ref> The Arlington County Central Library's collections include written materials as well as accounts in its Oral History Project of the desegregation struggle in the county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/virginiana-collection/|title=Virginiana Collection|publisher=Arlington Public Library |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:US Navy 061013-F-3500C-443 View over the U.S. Navy Annex, showing the completed U.S. Air Force memorial.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The former [[Navy Annex]] and the [[United States Air Force Memorial|Air Force Memorial]]]]\nArlington during the 1960s was undergoing tremendous change after the huge influx of newcomers in the 1950s.

Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.<ref>Kevin Craft, \"When Metro Came to Town: How the fight for mass transit was won.

State Senators are elected for four-year terms, while Delegates are elected for two-year terms.\n\nIn the Virginia State Senate, Arlington is split between the 30th and 31st districts, represented by [[Adam Ebbin]] and [[Barbara Favola]], respectively. In the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], Arlington is divided between the 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th districts, represented by [[Mark Levine (journalist)|Mark Levine]], [[Patrick A. Hope|Patrick Hope]], [[Rip Sullivan]], and [[Alfonso H. Lopez|Alfonso Lopez]], respectively.  All are Democrats.\n\nAt the presidential level, Arlington was once a fairly reliable GOP stronghold, supporting the Republican candidate in all but two elections from 1944 to 1980.  However, in 1984, Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] carried the county by a narrow margin, despite Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral landslide nationally.  It has gone Democratic in every presidential election since then. In fact, in 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] received the fewest raw votes of a major-party candidate in the county since [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in 1956, in addition to receiving the lowest proportion of Arlington's vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate in the past century. Arlington is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Don Beyer]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.\n\nArlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a \"treasury\" of Washington heirlooms.\n\nIn 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.\n\nWhen George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].\n\nThe U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.\n\nVeterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.\n\nThe [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an \"Eternal Flame.\" His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.\n\nOther frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the \"Iwo Jima Memorial\", the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].\n\n===The Pentagon===\n[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|The Pentagon, looking northeast with the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington Monument]] in the distance.]]\n\n{{Main|The Pentagon}}\n[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943 and it is the world's largest office building. Although it is located in Arlington, the [[United States Postal Service]] requires that \"Washington, D.C.\" be used as the place name in mail addressed to the six [[ZIP code]]s assigned to The Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html |title=Facts & Figures: Zip Codes |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311141422/http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html|archivedate=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe building is [[pentagon]]-shaped and houses about 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel. It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.\n\nBuilt during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has {{convert|17.5|mi|abbr=on}} of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.\n\nIt was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m\u00b3) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.\n\nThe open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest \"no-salute, no-cover\" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].\n\nDuring World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943 and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transportation==\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect [[Transportation in Arlington County, Virginia]] -->\n[[File:2019-06-26 11 51 06 View south along Interstate 395 (Henry G.

The great outflow of physicians to the armed forces during [[World War II]] and the drastic socioeconomic decline in the area that followed took their toll on Lincoln Hospital. With the loss of jobs from industrial restructuring, new immigrants and migrants from mostly poor, rural areas of the southern regions of the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[Latin America]] did not have the steady (but low skilled) labor opportunities of prior generations of immigrants.

A new hospital was built; its facilities included the latest developments in medical care.<ref name=lincoln-history /> The dedication took place on April 29, 1899. The hospital became a general hospital open to all people without regard to color or creed, although it maintained its founding connection as an institution dedicated to the relief and advancement of black people. During the hospital's reorganization and eventual occupation of the new site, its name was changed to Lincoln Hospital, in honor of president [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=lincoln-history />\n\n[[File:Archives of American Art - Eric Mose - 2869.jpg|Eric Mose works on a Federal Art Project mural for the \"Old Lincoln Hospital\" in 1938|thumbnail|left]]\n\nBecause of the increasing demand for services required by a more densely populated South Bronx\u2014and a decreasing supply of philanthropic funds\u2014in 1925 the Board of Trustees decided to sell Lincoln Hospital to the Department of Public Welfare of the City of New York.  The great outflow of physicians to the armed forces during [[World War II]] and the drastic socioeconomic decline in the area that followed took their toll on Lincoln Hospital. With the loss of jobs from industrial restructuring, new immigrants and migrants from mostly poor, rural areas of the southern regions of the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[Latin America]] did not have the steady (but low skilled) labor opportunities of prior generations of immigrants.  Their long-term standard of living was impacted.\n\nThe shift in population ushered in changes at Lincoln Hospital.  In 1969, a 15-day takeover of the Department of Psychiatry by predominantly Black and Puerto Rican non-professional staff, marked Lincoln Hospital as a key figure in the birth of the [[Community mental health service|community mental health]] movement. The occupiers criticized the paternalism of the white psychiatrists and challenged community mental health to be more than urban-serving institutions being dominated by well meaning elites who were neither sufficiently responsive to  - nor aware of - the needs of poor urban patients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft696nb3n8&chunk.id=d0e5184&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e5184&brand=ucpress|title=The Romance of Psychology: The State as Healer - Mental Health as Public Policy|last=Edited|first=Monograph|date=1982-2004|website=University of California Press: EBooks Collection|pages=256\u2013257|archive-url=|archive-date=1982-2004|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>  The next year, on July 14, 1970, the [[Young Lords]] - a radical group of Puerto Rican activists - occupied Lincoln Hospital\u2019s administrative building to protest the city\u2019s indifference to the health needs of Puerto Rican and African American patients.

There are at least three variations of the problems, which deal with situations in which many concurrent [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s of execution try to access the same shared resource at one time.\n\nSome threads may read and some may write, with the constraint that no thread may access the shared resource for either reading or writing while another thread is in the act of writing to it. (In particular, we want to prevent more than one thread modifying the shared resource simultaneously and allow for two or more readers to access the shared resource at the same time). A [[readers\u2013writer lock]] is a [[data structure]] that solves one or more of the readers\u2013writers problems.\n\nThe basic reader\u2013writers problem was first formulated and solved by Courtois ''et al.''{{r|courtois}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=Synchronization Algorithms and Concurrent Programming |first=Gadi |last=Taubenfeld |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2006 |page=301}}</ref>\n\n==First readers\u2013writers problem==\nSuppose we have a shared memory area (critical section) with the basic constraints detailed above. It is possible to protect the shared data behind a mutual exclusion [[mutex]], in which case no two threads can access the data at the same time. However, this solution is sub-optimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R<sub>1</sub>'' might have the lock, and then another reader ''R<sub>2</sub>'' requests access. It would be foolish for ''R<sub>2</sub>'' to wait until ''R<sub>1</sub>'' was done before starting its own read operation; instead, ''R<sub>2</sub>'' should be allowed to read the resource alongside ''R<sub>1</sub>'' because reads don't modify data, so concurrent reads are safe. This is the motivation for the '''first readers\u2013writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no reader shall be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading.''  This is also called '''readers-preference''', with its solution:\n<source lang=\"c\" line=\"1\">\nsemaphore resource=1;\nsemaphore rmutex=1;\nreadcount=0;\n\n/*\n   resource.P() is equivalent to wait(resource)\n   resource.V() is equivalent to signal(resource)\n   rmutex.P() is equivalent to wait(rmutex)\n   rmutex.V() is equivalent to signal(rmutex)\n*/\n\nwriter() {\n    resource.P();          //Lock the shared file for a writer\n\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    // Writing is done\n\n    <EXIT Section>\n    resource.V();          //Release the shared file for use by other readers. Writers are allowed if there are no readers requesting it.\n}\n\nreader() {\n    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the <Entry> section while you are in it\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    readcount++;          //Indicate that you are a reader trying to enter the Critical Section\n    if (readcount == 1)   //Checks if you are the first reader trying to enter CS\n        resource.P();     //If you are the first reader, lock the resource from writers. Resource stays reserved for subsequent readers\n    <EXIT CRITICAL Section>\n    rmutex.V();           //Release\n\n    // Do the Reading\n\n    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the <Exit> section while you are in it\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    readcount--;          //Indicate that you are no longer needing the shared resource. One fewer reader\n    if (readcount == 0)   //Checks if you are the last (only) reader who is reading the shared file\n        resource.V();     //If you are last reader, then you can unlock the resource. This makes it available to writers.\n    <EXIT CRITICAL Section>\n    rmutex.V();           //Release\n}\n</source>\n\nIn this solution of the readers/writers problem, the first reader must lock the resource (shared file) if such is available. Once the file is locked from writers, it may be used by many subsequent readers without having them to re-lock it again.\n\nBefore entering the [[critical section]], every new reader must go through the entry section. However, there may only be a single reader in the entry section at a time. This is done to avoid [[Race condition|race conditions]] on the readers (in this context, a race condition is a condition in which two or more threads are waking up simultaneously and trying to enter the critical section; without further constraint, the behavior is nondeterministic.  E.g. two readers increment the readcount at the same time, and both try to lock the resource, causing one reader to block).  To accomplish this, every reader which enters the <ENTRY Section> will lock the <ENTRY Section> for themselves until they are done with it. At this point the readers are not locking the resource. They are only locking the entry section so no other reader can enter it while they are in it. Once the reader is done executing the entry section, it will unlock it by signalling the mutex. Signalling it is equivalent to: mutex.V() in the above code. Same  is valid for the <EXIT Section>. There can be no more than a single reader in the exit section at a time, therefore, every reader must claim and lock the Exit section for themselves before using it.\n\nOnce the first reader is in the entry section, it will lock the resource. Doing this will prevent any writers from accessing it. Subsequent readers can just utilize the locked (from writers) resource. The very last reader (indicated by the readcount variable) must unlock the resource, thus making it available to writers.\n\nIn this solution, every writer must claim the resource individually. This means that a stream of readers can subsequently lock all potential writers out and starve them. This is so, because after the first reader locks the resource, no writer can lock it, before it gets released. And it will only be released by the very last reader. Hence, this solution does not satisfy fairness.\n\n==Second readers\u2013writers problem==\nThe first solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R<sub>1</sub>'' might have the lock, a writer ''W'' be waiting for the lock, and then a reader ''R<sub>2</sub>'' requests access. It would be unfair for ''R<sub>2</sub>'' to jump in immediately, ahead of ''W''; if that happened often enough, ''W'' would [[resource starvation|starve]]. Instead, ''W'' should start as soon as possible. This is the motivation for the '''second readers\u2013writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no writer, once added to the queue, shall be kept waiting longer than absolutely necessary''. This is also called '''writers-preference'''.\n\nA solution to the writers-preference scenario is:<ref name=\"courtois\">{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |title=Concurrent Control with \"Readers\" and \"Writers\" |first1=P.

Allows them to try enter CS for reading\n  wmutex.V();                  //release exit section\n}\n</source>\n\nIn this solution, preference is given to the writers. This is accomplished by forcing every reader to lock and release the readtry semaphore individually. The writers on the other hand don't need to lock it individually. Only the first writer will lock the readtry and then all subsequent writers can simply use the resource as it gets freed by the previous writer. The very last writer must release the readtry semaphore, thus opening the gate for readers to try reading.\n\nNo reader can engage in the entry section if the readtry semaphore has been set by a writer previously. The reader must wait for the last writer to unlock the resource and readtry semaphores. On the other hand, if a particular reader has locked the readtry semaphore, this will indicate to any potential concurrent writer that there is a reader in the entry section. So the writer will wait for the reader to release the readtry and then the writer will immediately lock it for itself and all subsequent writers. However, the writer will not be able to access the resource until the current reader has released the resource, which only occurs after the reader is finished with the resource in the critical section.\n\nThe resource semaphore can be locked by both the writer and  the reader in their entry section. They are only able to do so after first locking the readtry semaphore, which can only be done by one of them at a time.\n\nIf there are no writers wishing to get to the resource, as indicated to the reader by the status of the readtry semaphore, then the readers will not lock the resource. This is done to allow a writer to immediately take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is finished reading. Otherwise, the writer would need to wait for a queue of readers to be done before the last one can unlock the readtry semaphore. As soon as a writer shows up, it will try to set the readtry and hang up there waiting for the current reader to release the readtry. It will then take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is done reading and lock all future readers out. All subsequent readers will hang up at the readtry semaphore waiting for the writers to be finished with the resource and to open the gate by releasing readtry.\n\nThe rmutex and wmutex are used in exactly the same way as in the first solution. Their sole purpose is to avoid race conditions on the readers and writers while they are in their entry or exit sections.\n\n==Third readers\u2013writers problem==\nIn fact, the solutions implied by both problem statements can result in starvation &mdash; the first one may starve writers in the queue, and the second one may starve readers. Therefore, the '''third readers\u2013writers problem''' is sometimes proposed, which adds the constraint that ''no thread shall be allowed to starve''; that is, the operation of obtaining a lock on the shared data will always terminate in a bounded amount of time.\nA solution with fairness for both readers and writers might be as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"java\">\nint readCount;                  // init to 0; number of readers currently accessing resource\n\n// all semaphores initialised to 1\nSemaphore resourceAccess;       // controls access (read/write) to the resource\nSemaphore readCountAccess;      // for syncing changes to shared variable readCount\nSemaphore serviceQueue;         // FAIRNESS: preserves ordering of requests (signaling must be FIFO)\n\nvoid writer()\n{\n    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced\n    // <ENTER>\n    resourceAccess.P();         // request exclusive access to resource\n    // </ENTER>\n    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced\n    \n    // <WRITE>\n    writeResource();            // writing is performed\n    // </WRITE>\n    \n    // <EXIT>\n    resourceAccess.V();         // release resource access for next reader/writer\n    // </EXIT>\n}\n\nvoid reader()\n{\n    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced\n    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount\n    // <ENTER>\n    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers already reading:\n        resourceAccess.P();     // request resource access for readers (writers blocked)\n    readCount++;                // update count of active readers\n    // </ENTER>\n    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced\n    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount\n    \n    // <READ>\n    readResource();             // reading is performed\n    // </READ>\n    \n    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount\n    // <EXIT>\n    readCount--;                // update count of active readers\n    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers left:\n        resourceAccess.V();     // release resource access for all\n    // </EXIT>\n    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount\n}\n</source>\n\nThis solution can only satisfy the condition that \"no thread shall be allowed to starve\" if and only if semaphores preserve first-in first-out ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.\n\n=== Simplest Reader Writer Problem ===\n\nThe simplest reader writer problem which uses only two semaphores and doesn't need an array of readers to read the data in buffer.\n\nPlease notice that this solution gets simpler than the general case because it is made equivalent to the [[Producer\u2013consumer problem|Bounded buffer]] problem, and therefore only {{var|N}} readers are allowed to enter in parallel, {{var|N}} being the size of the buffer.\n\n==== Reader ====\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ndo {\n    wait(read)\n    ............\n    reading data\n    ............\n    signal(write)\n} while (TRUE);\n</source>\n\n==== Writer ====\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ndo {\n    wait(write)\n    .............\n    writing data\n    .............\n    signal(read)\n} while (TRUE);\n</source>\n\n==== Algorithm ====\n# Reader will run after Writer because of read semaphore.\n# Writer will stop writing when the write semaphore has reached 0.\n# Reader will stop reading when the read semaphore has reached 0.\n\nIn writer, the value of write semaphore is given to read semaphore and in reader, the value of read is given to write on completion of the loop.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ABA problem]]\n* [[Producers-consumers problem]]\n* [[Dining philosophers problem]]\n* [[Cigarette smokers problem]]\n* [[Sleeping barber problem]]\n* [[Readers\u2013writer lock]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Morris JM (1979).

There are at least three variations of the problems, which deal with situations in which many concurrent [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s of execution try to access the same shared resource at one time.\n\nSome threads may read and some may write, with the constraint that no thread may access the shared resource for either reading or writing while another thread is in the act of writing to it. (In particular, we want to prevent more than one thread modifying the shared resource simultaneously and allow for two or more readers to access the shared resource at the same time). A [[readers-writer lock]] is a [[data structure]] that solves one or more of the readers-writers problems.\n\nThe basic reader-writers problem was first formulated and solved by Courtois ''et al.''{{r|courtois}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=Synchronization Algorithms and Concurrent Programming |first=Gadi |last=Taubenfeld |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2006 |page=301}}</ref>\n\n==First readers-writers problem==\nSuppose we have a shared memory area (critical section) with the basic constraints detailed above. It is possible to protect the shared data behind a mutual exclusion [[mutex]], in which case no two threads can access the data at the same time. However, this solution is sub-optimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R<sub>1</sub>'' might have the lock, and then another reader ''R<sub>2</sub>'' requests access. It would be foolish for ''R<sub>2</sub>'' to wait until ''R<sub>1</sub>'' was done before starting its own read operation; instead, ''R<sub>2</sub>'' should be allowed to read the resource alongside ''R<sub>1</sub>'' because reads don't modify data, so concurrent reads are safe. This is the motivation for the '''first readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no reader shall be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading.''  This is also called '''readers-preference''', with its solution:\n<source lang=\"c\" line=\"1\">\nsemaphore resource=1;\nsemaphore rmutex=1;\nreadcount=0;\n\n/*\n   resource.P() is equivalent to wait(resource)\n   resource.V() is equivalent to signal(resource)\n   rmutex.P() is equivalent to wait(rmutex)\n   rmutex.V() is equivalent to signal(rmutex)\n*/\n\nwriter() {\n    resource.P();          //Lock the shared file for a writer\n\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    // Writing is done\n\n    <EXIT Section>\n    resource.V();          //Release the shared file for use by other readers. Writers are allowed if there are no readers requesting it.\n}\n\nreader() {\n    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the <Entry> section while you are in it\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    readcount++;          //Indicate that you are a reader trying to enter the Critical Section\n    if (readcount == 1)   //Checks if you are the first reader trying to enter CS\n        resource.P();     //If you are the first reader, lock the resource from writers. Resource stays reserved for subsequent readers\n    <EXIT CRITICAL Section>\n    rmutex.V();           //Release\n\n    // Do the Reading\n\n    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the <Exit> section while you are in it\n    <CRITICAL Section>\n    readcount--;          //Indicate that you are no longer needing the shared resource. One fewer reader\n    if (readcount == 0)   //Checks if you are the last (only) reader who is reading the shared file\n        resource.V();     //If you are last reader, then you can unlock the resource. This makes it available to writers.\n    <EXIT CRITICAL Section>\n    rmutex.V();           //Release\n}\n</source>\n\nIn this solution of the readers/writers problem, the first reader must lock the resource (shared file) if such is available. Once the file is locked from writers, it may be used by many subsequent readers without having them to re-lock it again.\n\nBefore entering the [[critical section]], every new reader must go through the entry section. However, there may only be a single reader in the entry section at a time. This is done to avoid [[Race condition|race conditions]] on the readers (in this context, a race condition is a condition in which two or more threads are waking up simultaneously and trying to enter the critical section; without further constraint, the behavior is nondeterministic.  E.g. two readers increment the readcount at the same time, and both try to lock the resource, causing one reader to block).  To accomplish this, every reader which enters the <ENTRY Section> will lock the <ENTRY Section> for themselves until they are done with it. At this point the readers are not locking the resource. They are only locking the entry section so no other reader can enter it while they are in it. Once the reader is done executing the entry section, it will unlock it by signalling the mutex. Signalling it is equivalent to: mutex.V() in the above code. Same  is valid for the <EXIT Section>. There can be no more than a single reader in the exit section at a time, therefore, every reader must claim and lock the Exit section for themselves before using it.\n\nOnce the first reader is in the entry section, it will lock the resource. Doing this will prevent any writers from accessing it. Subsequent readers can just utilize the locked (from writers) resource. The very last reader (indicated by the readcount variable) must unlock the resource, thus making it available to writers.\n\nIn this solution, every writer must claim the resource individually. This means that a stream of readers can subsequently lock all potential writers out and starve them. This is so, because after the first reader locks the resource, no writer can lock it, before it gets released. And it will only be released by the very last reader. Hence, this solution does not satisfy fairness.\n\n==Second readers-writers problem==\nThe first solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R<sub>1</sub>'' might have the lock, a writer ''W'' be waiting for the lock, and then a reader ''R<sub>2</sub>'' requests access. It would be unfair for ''R<sub>2</sub>'' to jump in immediately, ahead of ''W''; if that happened often enough, ''W'' would [[resource starvation|starve]]. Instead, ''W'' should start as soon as possible. This is the motivation for the '''second readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no writer, once added to the queue, shall be kept waiting longer than absolutely necessary''. This is also called '''writers-preference'''.\n\nA solution to the writers-preference scenario is:<ref name=\"courtois\">{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |title=Concurrent Control with \"Readers\" and \"Writers\" |first1=P.

Allows them to try enter CS for reading\n  wmutex.V();                  //release exit section\n}\n</source>\n\nIn this solution, preference is given to the writers. This is accomplished by forcing every reader to lock and release the readtry semaphore individually. The writers on the other hand don't need to lock it individually. Only the first writer will lock the readtry and then all subsequent writers can simply use the resource as it gets freed by the previous writer. The very last writer must release the readtry semaphore, thus opening the gate for readers to try reading.\n\nNo reader can engage in the entry section if the readtry semaphore has been set by a writer previously. The reader must wait for the last writer to unlock the resource and readtry semaphores. On the other hand, if a particular reader has locked the readtry semaphore, this will indicate to any potential concurrent writer that there is a reader in the entry section. So the writer will wait for the reader to release the readtry and then the writer will immediately lock it for itself and all subsequent writers. However, the writer will not be able to access the resource until the current reader has released the resource, which only occurs after the reader is finished with the resource in the critical section.\n\nThe resource semaphore can be locked by both the writer and  the reader in their entry section. They are only able to do so after first locking the readtry semaphore, which can only be done by one of them at a time.\n\nIf there are no writers wishing to get to the resource, as indicated to the reader by the status of the readtry semaphore, then the readers will not lock the resource. This is done to allow a writer to immediately take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is finished reading. Otherwise, the writer would need to wait for a queue of readers to be done before the last one can unlock the readtry semaphore. As soon as a writer shows up, it will try to set the readtry and hang up there waiting for the current reader to release the readtry. It will then take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is done reading and lock all future readers out. All subsequent readers will hang up at the readtry semaphore waiting for the writers to be finished with the resource and to open the gate by releasing readtry.\n\nThe rmutex and wmutex are used in exactly the same way as in the first solution. Their sole purpose is to avoid race conditions on the readers and writers while they are in their entry or exit sections.\n\n==Third readers-writers problem==\nIn fact, the solutions implied by both problem statements can result in starvation &mdash; the first one may starve writers in the queue, and the second one may starve readers. Therefore, the '''third readers-writers problem''' is sometimes proposed, which adds the constraint that ''no thread shall be allowed to starve''; that is, the operation of obtaining a lock on the shared data will always terminate in a bounded amount of time.\nA solution with fairness for both readers and writers might be as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"java\">\nint readCount;                  // init to 0; number of readers currently accessing resource\n\n// all semaphores initialised to 1\nSemaphore resourceAccess;       // controls access (read/write) to the resource\nSemaphore readCountAccess;      // for syncing changes to shared variable readCount\nSemaphore serviceQueue;         // FAIRNESS: preserves ordering of requests (signaling must be FIFO)\n\nvoid writer()\n{\n    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced\n    // <ENTER>\n    resourceAccess.P();         // request exclusive access to resource\n    // </ENTER>\n    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced\n    \n    // <WRITE>\n    writeResource();            // writing is performed\n    // </WRITE>\n    \n    // <EXIT>\n    resourceAccess.V();         // release resource access for next reader/writer\n    // </EXIT>\n}\n\nvoid reader()\n{\n    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced\n    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount\n    // <ENTER>\n    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers already reading:\n        resourceAccess.P();     // request resource access for readers (writers blocked)\n    readCount++;                // update count of active readers\n    // </ENTER>\n    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced\n    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount\n    \n    // <READ>\n    readResource();             // reading is performed\n    // </READ>\n    \n    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount\n    // <EXIT>\n    readCount--;                // update count of active readers\n    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers left:\n        resourceAccess.V();     // release resource access for all\n    // </EXIT>\n    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount\n}\n</source>\n\nThis solution can only satisfy the condition that \"no thread shall be allowed to starve\" if and only if semaphores preserve first-in first-out ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.\n\n=== Simplest Reader Writer Problem ===\n\nThe simplest reader writer problem which uses only two semaphores and doesn't need an array of readers to read the data in buffer.\n\nPlease notice that this solution gets simpler than the general case because it is made equivalent to the [[Producer\u2013consumer problem|Bounded buffer]] problem, and therefore only {{var|N}} readers are allowed to enter in parallel, {{var|N}} being the size of the buffer.\n\n==== Reader ====\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ndo {\n    wait(read)\n    ............\n    reading data\n    ............\n    signal(write)\n} while (TRUE);\n</source>\n\n==== Writer ====\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ndo {\n    wait(write)\n    .............\n    writing data\n    .............\n    signal(read)\n} while (TRUE);\n</source>\n\n==== Algorithm ====\n# Reader will run after Writer because of read semaphore.\n# Writer will stop writing when the write semaphore has reached 0.\n# Reader will stop reading when the read semaphore has reached 0.\n\nIn writer, the value of write semaphore is given to read semaphore and in reader, the value of read is given to write on completion of the loop.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ABA problem]]\n* [[Producers-consumers problem]]\n* [[Dining philosophers problem]]\n* [[Cigarette smokers problem]]\n* [[Sleeping barber problem]]\n* [[Readers\u2013writer lock]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Morris JM (1979) A starvation-free solution to the mutual exclusion problem.
