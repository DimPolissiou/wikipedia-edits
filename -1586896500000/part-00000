He is portrayed by [[Michael Mando]] and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nNacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill [[Hector Salamanca]], the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by [[Gus Fring]], who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd [[Lalo Salamanca]] to oversee operations.\n\n== Concept and development ==\n[[Michael Mando]] said that he had been approached through his agent from ''Better Call Saul''{{'s}} casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \"love at first sight\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later.<ref name=\"abq mando\" /> To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of ''Breaking Bad'', which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \"extremely intelligent and patient\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show.<ref name=\"abq mando\">{{Cite news |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019s bad guy looks forward to season two |date=February 22, 2015 |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |access-date=March 9, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410180943/https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |archive-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself.<ref name=\"postmedia mando\" /> For part of that, he explored elements of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] cultures to bring to the character.

While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his [[upholstery]] business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nWhile attempting to represent the Kettlemans, a family accused of embezzling $1.6 million, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] has a run-in with [[Tuco Salamanca]]. Tuco  has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home.  Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release.\n\nNacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\"), who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nDaniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy [[Hummer]]. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.\n\nNacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure.  As Tuco become increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him.  Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. [[Hector Salamanca]] has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations.  He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the {{USD|250,000}} hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind.  To protect his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen [[placebo]] in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose.  Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication.  Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life.  Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang.  The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father.

Buyer complaints lead Lalo to meet with Gus and Juan Bolsa.  Gus presents a cover story about Werner Ziegler, of whose activities Lalo was partly aware.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}}  Gus claims Werner was working on a legitimate construction project at the chicken farm and stole cocaine, which Gus then replaced with meth.  The story explains the events of which Lalo is aware&nbsp;\u2013 Werner's work for Gus and escape, Mike's pursuit, and Werner's death.  Lalo accepts Gus' story and apology, but remains suspicious.\n\nGus threatens Manuel's life in order to coerce Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. When police identify a Salamanca drug house and arrest Domingo, Nacho sneaks over rooftops to recover the drug stash before police enter, which impresses Lalo, who begins to take Nacho into his confidence.  Lalo is concerned that Domingo will talk in jail, so he and Nacho arrange to secure Domingo's release by providing police information on Gus's dead drops. Nacho reports this plan to Gus.  Gus decides to keep the dead drops in place, despite the likely loss of $700,000 in cash, because removing them would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas.\n\nGus, Victor, and Mike meet with Nacho and Nacho pretends not to recognize Mike. He reports on Lalo's plan to give police the locations of Gus's street dealers and Gus tells Nacho to report to Mike from now on. Nacho attempts to warn Mike about Gus's ruthlessness, but Mike reminds Nacho that he warned Nacho about the risk Nacho was taking when he attempted to kill Hector Salamanca.{{efn|from \"[[Expenses (Better Call Saul)|Expenses]]\"}} Mike secretly points the police to Lalo's car and its connection to the murder of Fred, the money wire store clerk.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}} Nacho calls Mike to report Lalo's location. Mike uses a police radio and pretends to be an officer requesting a check of Lalo's licence plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo while he is driving and detain him.\n\nFrom jail, Lalo instructs Nacho to further disrupt Gus's business activities by burning down one of his restaurants, information Nacho relays to Mike. To preserve Nacho's role as his mole in the Salamanca organization, Gus and Nacho vandalize his flagship restaurant and set off an explosion that burns it down. Nacho enlists Jimmy to represent Lalo. Gus desires Lalo's release, so Mike provides Jimmy information on the investigation he did of Lalo under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the details to secure Lalo's release on US$7 million cash bail. Lalo has Jimmy pick up the cash funds for bail from The Cousins at a remote location in the desert. On his way back, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen, but Mike was tracking him for Gus and kills all but one attacker. The surviving gunman escapes in the only attacker's vehicle that is still drivable. Mike's truck was also damaged, so Mike and Jimmy begin the drive back to Albuquerque in Jimmy's car. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of he road and walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. After killing the surviving gunman and walking for two days in the desert, Jimmy and Mike make their way back to Albuquerque and Jimmy posts Lalo's bail. Jimmy says he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo says he will return to Mexico to avoid police scrutiny. Mike reports on the attack to Gus, who realizes Juan Bolsa engineered the attack to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho no longer wants to be his informant on the Salamanca organization, and express his unhappiness at Gus threatening Nacho's father to obtain Nacho's compliance. Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset, and Mike silently leaves his office.\n\nNacho informs Mike of Lalo's plan to return to Mexico. Lalo says goodbye to Hector and Nacho brings him to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho they are returning to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Nacho and Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. Nacho waits in his car while Lalo goes inside. Unseen by Nacho, Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby rooftop. Lalo asks Jimmy to repeat the story of his desert trek several times, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied with Kim's argument and departs. After Lalo gets back in Nacho's car, he tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pick up site.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\nNacho did not appear in ''Breaking Bad'', but is named in the second-season episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", the same episode that introduced Saul Goodman. In the episode, [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Jesse Pinkman]] attempt to coerce Saul into representing Badger after Badger is arrested for selling drugs. Unaware of who his gun-wielding captors are, Saul tries to pin blame on \"Ignacio\", who was later confirmed by ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'' producers to be Nacho Varga.<ref name=\"vulture ignacio\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\nMando has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Nacho.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/02/10/michael-mando-better-call-saul-interview_n_6652668.html |title=Canadian Boy Makes Waves On 'Better Call Saul' |last=Jancelewicz |first=Chris |date=February 10, 2015 |website=[[HuffPost]] |location=Canada |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213090107/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/02/10/michael-mando-better-call-saul-interview_n_6652668.html |archive-date=February 13, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Notelist==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul/cast-crew/nacho-varga Nacho Varga] at [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Varga, Nacho}}\n[[Category:Better Call Saul characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional career criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional gangsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional henchmen]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{all plot|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #133E51\n| name               = Nacho Varga\n| series             = [[Better Call Saul]]\n| image              = NachoVargaBCS.jpg\n| caption            = [[Michael Mando]] as Nacho Varga in a promotional poster for [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|''Better Call Saul''{{'}}s fourth season]]\n| first              = \"[[Mijo]]\" (2015)\n| last               = \n| creator            = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Vince Gilligan]]\n* [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]]\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Michael Mando]]\n| full_name          = Ignacio Varga\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Tuco's Lieutenant\n* Hector's Lieutenant\n* Criminal associate of [[Gus Fring]]\n}}\n| family             = Manuel Varga (father)\n| nationality        = Mexican\n| home               = [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], United States\n}}\n'''Ignacio <!-- do not shoehorn Nacho here per [[WP:HYPOCORISM]], since it is a common diminutive of Ignacio (see [[Hypocorism#Spanish]]) -->Varga''' is a fictional character who appears in the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', a prequel [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. He is portrayed by [[Michael Mando]] and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nNacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill [[Hector Salamanca]], the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by [[Gus Fring]], who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd [[Lalo Salamanca]] to oversee operations.\n\n== Concept and development ==\n[[Michael Mando]] said that he had been approached through his agent from ''Better Call Saul''{{'s}} casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \"love at first sight\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later.<ref name=\"abq mando\" /> To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of ''Breaking Bad'', which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \"extremely intelligent and patient\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show.<ref name=\"abq mando\">{{Cite news |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019s bad guy looks forward to season two |date=February 22, 2015 |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |access-date=March 9, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410180943/https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |archive-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself.<ref name=\"postmedia mando\" /> For part of that, he explored elements of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] cultures to bring to the character. He also brought some of the supervisial traits of his ''[[Orphan Black]]'' character Vic Schmidt into Nacho.<ref name=\"postmedia mando\">{{Cite web |url=https://o.canada.com/entertainment/television/quebec-actor-michael-mando-plays-better-call-saul-villian |title=Quebec actor Michael Mando plays Better Call Saul {{sic|nolink=y|villian}} |last=Strachan |first=Alex |date=February 4, 2015 |website=[[Postmedia News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812060609/http://o.canada.com/entertainment/television/quebec-actor-michael-mando-plays-better-call-saul-villian |archive-date=August 12, 2018 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMando said that initially Nacho was going to have a larger role with Jimmy in the first season, being the season's \"[[Big Bad|big bad]]\", but as Gilligan and Gould wrote out the season, they made the character of [[Chuck McGill]] more of an antagonist for Jimmy, and so Nacho was placed on a slower path to be developed in later seasons.

While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his [[upholstery]] business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nWhile attempting to represent the Kettlemans, a family accused of embezzling $1.6 million, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] has a run-in with [[Tuco Salamanca]]. Tuco  has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home.  Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release.\n\nNacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\"), who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nDaniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy [[Hummer]]. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.\n\nNacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure.  As Tuco become increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him.  Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. [[Hector Salamanca]] has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations.  He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the {{USD|250,000}} hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind.  To protect his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen [[placebo]] in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose.  Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication.  Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life.  Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang.  The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father.  Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nUnder Gus' orders, Nacho replaces some of the Salamanca cocaine supply with inferior, locally produced methamphetamine.  Buyer complaints lead Lalo to meet with Gus and Juan Bolsa.  Gus presents a cover story about Werner Ziegler, of whose activities Lalo was partly aware.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}}  Gus claims Werner was working on a legitimate construction project at the chicken farm and stole cocaine, which Gus then replaced with meth.

On his way back, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen but Mike arrives to protect him, and accompanies him to return to the city after Jimmy's car breaks down. Jimmy pays for Lalo's bail, giving him a cover story that omits the attack or Mike's involvement, and Lalo makes plans to return to Mexico due to increased interest on his alias. Meanwhile, Mike reports on the attack to Gus, and then also tells him that Nacho no longer wants to be Gus's spy, but Gus refuses to give up Nacho as an asset.\n\nNacho reports to Mike about driving Lalo to a dropoff point near Mexico the next day. After Lalo says goodbye to Hector, Nacho drives him to the same spot where Jimmy had picked up the bail money. Lalo realizes he had not seen Jimmy's car, and has Nacho help him search for it, soon discovering it in a ditch with bullet holes. Lalo has Nacho drive them back to the city and Jimmy's apartment. Lalo confronts Jimmy on his story as Kim watches, with Mike also listening from a nearby roof with a sniper rifle aimed on Lalo. Kim eventually tells Lalo to leave Jimmy alone and helps to vouch for Jimmy's story. Lalo leaves, but tells Nacho that they are now going to drive all the way into Mexico.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\nNacho did not appear in ''Breaking Bad'', but is named in the second-season episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", the same episode that introduced Saul Goodman. In the episode, [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Jesse Pinkman]] attempt to coerce Saul into representing Badger after Badger is arrested for selling drugs.

RES 16 AUTUMN 88. p.111.</ref>\n[[File:A voyage to Guinea, Brasil, and the West-Indies; in His Majesty&#039;s Ships, the Swallow and Weymouth Fleuron T087658-1.png|thumb|Etching taken from ''A voyage to Guinea, Brasil, and the West-Indies; in His Majesty's Ships, the Swallow and Weymouth'' by John Atkins, pub. 1735]]\n\n==Biography==\nAtkins received his professional education as a surgeon's apprentice, and immediately entered the navy. He records wounds which he treated in [[Sir George Rooke]]'s victory off [[M\u00e1laga]] (1703). In 1707 he was in some small actions with the French in the [[English Channel|Channel]], and in 1711, he served in the man-of-war [[HMS Lion (1709)|HMS ''Lion'']] at the [[battle of Vado Bay]]. The ship was commanded by Captain [[Galfridus Walpole]], whose right arm was severely wounded. Atkins cut it off above the elbow and sat up two whole nights with the patient afterwards, \u2018supposing a tenderness and respect would engage his good opinion and consequently his interest.\u2019 This interested attention did not gain its object, for Captain Galfridus gave no thanks for it, being, as Atkins bitterly observes, \u2018the reverse of his brother ([[Sir Robert Walpole|Sir Robert]]), loving cheapness in all jobs\u2019 (Navy Surgeon, 137).\n\nIn February 1721 Atkins sailed from [[Spithead]] for the coast of [[Guinea]] with the [[HMS Swallow|Swallow]] and the [[HMS Weymouth (1693)|Weymouth]], sent to put down piracy on the west coast of Africa. They visited [[Sierra Leone]], [[Wydah]], the [[Gaboon]], [[Elmina]], and captured at [[Cape Lopez]] 270 pirates and 10,000l. in gold dust. When the pirates were tried, Atkins was made registrary, and complains that for twenty-six hard days' work he only received as many pounds.\n\nThree or four of the crew died every day for six weeks, and the surgeon became [[purser]] for lack of another survivor fit for the office. They sailed to [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]], where at [[Port Royal]] a hurricane carried off the masts. In April 1723 the vessels returned to England and were paid off. Atkins was unsuccessful in getting another ship, and took to writing books.\n\n===Publishing===\nAtkins published two books, both of which have had more than one edition. The \u2018Navy Surgeon\u2019 was published first (1732). It is a general treatise on surgery, with remarks on mineral springs, empirics, amulets, and infirmaries. It shows the author to have been an observant but somewhat prejudiced practitioner. The cases are clearly related, and are the best part of the book. Many surgical books are quoted, and enough of other books to show that Atkins was widely read. [[Horace]], [[Juvenal]], Pope, and Milton were known to him, and he admired also [[Stephen Duck]]. This book appeared in a shorter form as \u2018A Treatise on the following Chirurgical Subjects,\u2019 &c., without date.\n\nAtkins was one of the earliest scientists to be a proponent of the [[polygenist]] theory of human origins. In his book ''A Voyage to Guinea'' (1723) he said \"I am persuaded that the black and white race have sprung from different coloured parents.\"<ref>David Keane, Caste-based discrimination in international human rights law, 2007, p. 89</ref>\n\nIn 1735 he published ''A Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies.''<ref name=\"FalolaWarnock2007\">{{cite book|editor= [[Toyin Falola]] and Amanda Warnock |title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Passage |year= 2007|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-33480-1 |chapter=Chronology |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&pg=PR29 }}</ref> This describes the voyage of the Swallow and the Weymouth, and is full of interesting information about the [[slave trade]] and the natural history of the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. He describes the [[manatee]] accurately, and tells much about [[fetish worship]].

He records wounds which he treated in [[Sir George Rooke]]'s victory off [[M\u00e1laga]] (1703). In 1707 he was in some small actions with the French in the [[English Channel|Channel]], and in 1711, he served in the man-of-war [[HMS Lion (1709)|HMS ''Lion'']] at the [[battle of Vado Bay]]. The ship was commanded by Captain [[Galfridus Walpole]], whose right arm was severely wounded. Atkins cut it off above the elbow and sat up two whole nights with the patient afterwards, \u2018supposing a tenderness and respect would engage his good opinion and consequently his interest.\u2019 This interested attention did not gain its object, for Captain Galfridus gave no thanks for it, being, as Atkins bitterly observes, \u2018the reverse of his brother ([[Sir Robert Walpole|Sir Robert]]), loving cheapness in all jobs\u2019 (Navy Surgeon, 137).\n\nIn February 1721 Atkins sailed from [[Spithead]] for the coast of [[Guinea]] with the [[HMS Swallow|Swallow]] and the [[HMS Weymouth (1693)|Weymouth]], sent to put down piracy on the west coast of Africa. They visited [[Sierra Leone]], [[Wydah]], the [[Gaboon]], [[Elmina]], and captured at [[Cape Lopez]] 270 pirates and 10,000l. in gold dust. When the pirates were tried, Atkins was made registrary, and complains that for twenty-six hard days' work he only received as many pounds.\n\nThree or four of the crew died every day for six weeks, and the surgeon became [[purser]] for lack of another survivor fit for the office. They sailed to [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]], where at [[Port Royal]] a hurricane carried off the masts. In April 1723 the vessels returned to England and were paid off. Atkins was unsuccessful in getting another ship, and took to writing books.\n\n===Publishing===\nAtkins published two books, both of which have had more than one edition. The \u2018Navy Surgeon\u2019 was published first (1732). It is a general treatise on surgery, with remarks on mineral springs, empirics, amulets, and infirmaries. It shows the author to have been an observant but somewhat prejudiced practitioner. The cases are clearly related, and are the best part of the book. Many surgical books are quoted, and enough of other books to show that Atkins was widely read. [[Horace]], [[Juvenal]], Pope, and Milton were known to him, and he admired also [[Stephen Duck]]. This book appeared in a shorter form as \u2018A Treatise on the following Chirurgical Subjects,\u2019 &c., without date.\n\nAtkins was one of the earliest scientists to be a proponent of the [[polygenist]] theory of human origins. In his book ''A Voyage to Guinea'' (1723) he said \"I am persuaded that the black and white race have sprung from different coloured parents.\"<ref>David Keane, Caste-based discrimination in international human rights law, 2007, p. 89</ref>\n\nIn 1735 he published ''A Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies.''<ref name=\"FalolaWarnock2007\">{{cite book|editor= [[Toyin Falola]] and Amanda Warnock |title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Passage |year= 2007|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-33480-1 |chapter=Chronology |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&pg=PR29 }}</ref> This describes the voyage of the Swallow and the Weymouth, and is full of interesting information about the [[slave trade]] and the natural history of the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. He describes the [[manatee]] accurately, and tells much about [[fetish worship]]. He shows that there was no evidence of a general [[cannibalism]] in any negro tribe, but mentions how an English captain made one slave eat the [[liver]] of another as a punishment. He gives full accounts of the winds and currents, and leaves the impression that he was intelligent and truthful.

It played an important role in the country's 20th-century history despite the relatively small number of members.[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1975/no076/newsinger.htm] In 1992 the Communist Party - Brazilian Section of the Communist Internacional divided itself in two different parties: the Brazillian Communist Party and the [[Socialist People\u2019s Party (Brazil)]].\n\nThe youth wing of PCB is known as Young Communist Union.\n\n==History==\n'''<big>Split and struggle for the acronym</big>''' \n\nIn 1992, a group led by Roberto Freire, a majority within the party leadership of the former PCB, declared the extinction of the then PCB, and the creation, in its place, of the Popular Socialist Party. The convention, considered controversial, was eventually recognized by the Superior Electoral Court. Older members classified the action of the group linked to its then president, Roberto Freire, as a coup, and decided to launch a founding notice for a new party, which would then use the name of the now extinct association: Brazillian Communist Party<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618230119/http://radiovox.org/2016/05/13/a-criacao-do-pps/|title=A Cria\u00e7\u00e3o do PPS - WWW.RADIOVOX.ORG|date=2018-06-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>. The PPS, despite being considered a new party, declared itself the successor of the old party, and inherited its electoral registration and patrimony, so that the group that formed the new PCB had to restart its electoral trajectory from scratch.\n\n===Refoundation and reorganization===\nAfter the dissolution of the PCB, decided by the 10th Congress, the Central Committee minority that was opposed to this action organized an \"Extraordinary Reorganization Conference\", where it decided to rebuild the party with the maintaining of its identity and by reviewing the path that it had followed in the precedent years. The party then started a battle in order to gain the rights to use the name Brazilian Communist Party and the acronym PCB (which was contested by the members of the PPS) and to legalize the party. In 1996, the PCB would be officially registered.\n\nThe Party has realized four congresses since then: the 10th (1993), 11th (1996), 12th (2000) and the 13th (2006). It remains small, in spite of some recent growth during the government of [[Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] and the crisis of [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] (it should be noticed that the main result of this process was the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]]). Although competing in elections and participating in wider electoral fronts, its electoral results were insignificant.\n\nIn 2006, the PCB agreed on a nationwide alliance with two other left-wing parties, [[Socialism and Liberty Party|PSOL]] and [[United Socialist Workers' Party|PSTU]]. Putting aside some significant ideological differences, the three parties built a common agenda to try to break the polarity between presidential candidates [[Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] ([[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]]) and [[Geraldo Alckmin]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]). The coalition also extended to gubernatorial and parliament elections to take place at the same time all over the country.\nThe PCB elected a state deputy (Jorge Souza, in the state of [[Amap\u00e1]]) and has about 20 local representatives.\n\nThe party's union branch currently builds the central Intersindical and is growing greatly in the union movement. The student movement is responsibility of the Young Communist Union, which is also growing in size.\n\nThe last party's Congress, the 13th, in 2005, voted to abolish the post of \"president\" and use only the traditional position of \"secretary-general\".\n\n==Electoral results==\n===Presidential elections===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-----\n!

It played an important role in the country's 20th-century history despite the relatively small number of members.[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1975/no076/newsinger.htm] A factional dispute led to the formation of [[Communist Party of Brazil|PCdoB]] (Communist Party of Brazil) in the 1960s, though both communist parties were united in opposition to the [[Brazilian military government]] that ruled from 1964 to 1985. But with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of [[communism]] circa 1990, the party lost power and international support. An internal coup in 1992 divided the party and formed a new party, called [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]], using the former identification number of the PCB, 23.\n\nThe youth wing of PCB is known as Young Communist Union.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe '''Brazilian Communist Party''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Partido Comunista Brasileiro''), abbreviated as the '''PCB''', was founded on March 25, 1922 in the [[city]] of [[Niter\u00f3i]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. On that day, nine representatives of [[communism|communist]] groups from the cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], [[Cruzeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo|Cruzeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Recife]], [[Niter\u00f3i]], [[Juiz de Fora]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] met and approved the party's statutes and the twenty-one conditions for entering the [[Communist International]], though the PCB was not recognized by the Comintern in its first years due to its eclectic ideological roots. The meeting ended with all seventy-three members of the party singing [[The Internationale|L'Internationale]] (quietly, to avoid being overheard).\n\n===Early years===\nThe PCB's first years were marked by an effort to encourage socialist thinking in [[Brazil]]. There had been moderate socialist parties, newspapers and congresses, but much unlike the strong social-democratic parties that existed in many European countries. The radical anti-[[capitalism|capitalist]] thinking had been dominated by [[Anarchism in Brazil|anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists]], who also dominated the [[labour movement]], such as in the case of the [[Anarchism in Brazil|1917 anarchist actions]] in S\u00e3o Paulo. Inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], a group of former anarchist militants who were disappointed in the lack of unity and force of the movement, turned communist and started the PCB. At the same time, some other figures from Brazil's early labour- and socialist movements became inspired by forms of military and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[populism]], like the [[Tenente revolts|tenentes]], that eventually led to the [[Get\u00falio Vargas|Vargas]]-revolution of 1930.\n\nDuring the first years, the party was declared illegal by the [[Federal government of Brazil|government]]. On May 1, 1925, during the party's Second Congress, its weekly [[newspaper]] ''A Classe Oper\u00e1ria'' (''The Working Class'') was announced, with five thousand copies being sold on the factories. This number grew to nine hundred copies by the ninth edition, but the [[police]] shut the newspaper down shortly after the twelfth edition was published. The paper reappeared in 1928, after the Third Congress was held.\n\nBy 1930, after being recognized by the Communist International and with its [[Socialist Youth (Brazil)|Socialist Youth]] division formed, the PCB had nearly eleven hundred members. This marks the beginning of a long period of submission to, initially the [[Communist International|Third International]], and, after its dissolution, to the political leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. This [[decade]] also marked two cycles on the party's history: one of increasing influence, until 1935, and one of decline, until 1942. Both cycles are comprehensible when seen in the context of the [[Get\u00falio Vargas|Vargas]] era.\n\n===Reorganization and growth===\nOn 1943, during the so-called ''Mantiqueira Conference'', the party secretly met in the small [[city]] of Engenheiro Passos, Rio de Janeiro, and in an open [[Letter (message)|letter]] to Vargas decided to support a [[declaration of war]] on the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. At the same time, [[Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes]] was elected to the party's [[presidency]]. On 1945, after Vargas's [[dictatorship]] ended, the PCB became legal once again. By 1947, it had nearly two hundred thousand members. In the 1947 legislative election, it received 480 thousand votes or about 9% of total votes cast. However, this period of official tolerance did not last long, as President [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra|Dutra]] denounced the PCB as \"internationalist, and therefore not committed to Brazil's own interests\" in 1948, an action supported by the [[United States|American]] government.\n\nIn the 1950s, as the party was driven underground, it began supporting major workers' [[Strike action|strikes]] around Brazil. However, this did not prevent the beginning of internal clashes between different factions within the PCB. This became more evident after the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]'s [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Congress]], when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced [[Joseph Stalin]]'s policies. The factionalization of the party accelerated after a new Manifesto was passed in 1958, proposing new ways of achieving communist goals. This Manifesto linked the establishment of [[socialism]] to the broadening of democracy. Some of its top leaders, dissatisfied with the new Soviet line, quit the PCB and formed a new party, [[Communist Party of Brazil]] (''Partido Comunista do Brasil'' - PCdoB) in 1962.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] estimated the number of organized communists in Brazil to around 31,000.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in The [[American Political Science Review]], Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\n===Military rule years===\nWith this new orientation, the PCB grew in size and exercised a much greater role in the Brazilian left. However, the alliance forged with the other parties did not survive the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. PCB did play an important role against the dictatorship, by organizing the workers movement and participating in efforts to unite the opposition in its demands for democratic reforms. At that point in time the communists were a fraction of the democratic opposition front, the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB). It refused, for example, to engage in armed struggle, differently from other left wing organizations that decided to follow that path. The clandestine operations and the political disputes regarding the strategies to resist the military regime led to many important leaders leaving the party, while many others died in the hands of the military regime. To the end of the dictatorship, while the Communist Party in Brazil was involved in several internal clashes, the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] (Partido dos Trabalhadores) was founded. Its creation was the project of a series of left wing groups independent from the PCB ([[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], communist dissidents, ex-[[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], sectors of the Catholic Left, independent unionists and intellectuals). It was structured as an alternative to Communist-led unionism in Brazil. Forswearing the Popular Front strategy adopted by the PCB, the PT chose instead to take a more radical stance against the military regime and gained a strong presence in between high skilled workers and middle-class intellectuals. The growth of the PT accelerated the fragmentation process inside the PCB leading ultimately to a big split.\n\n===Crisis and formation of the PPS===\nAfter the 1979 amnesty, the PCB's leaders began to restructure the party. The 1982 Congress confirmed its democratic agenda, declaring the PCB \"a party of the masses, linking socialist goals to true democracy, which will be constructed based on the values of [[Political freedom|freedom]]\". Once again, internal clashes developed in the party, as it was passing through a process of renewal while its influence in society declined. The fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] was also a strong blow to the party, turning the renewal process into one where [[Marxism]] began to be abandoned by party leaders. This crisis reached its high point in January 1992.\n\nA group led by the then-President [[Roberto Freire (politician)|Roberto Freire]] called its 10th Congress despite a Congressional resolution which had been passed a year earlier that the party would not call a congress for that year and that determined that the party would be kept. Nevertheless, Freire managed to organize it and allow people who were not members of the party to vote.  That congress voted to dissolve the PCB and refound it as the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] (''Partido Popular Socialista'' - PPS), in a way similar to what had transpired in Italy.\n\nHowever a small group, led by Ivan Pinheiro, questioning the legality of the 10th Congress, decided to keep the party [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]].\n\n===Refoundation and reorganization===\nAfter the dissolution of the PCB, decided by the 10th Congress, the Central Committee minority that was opposed to this action organized an \"Extraordinary Reorganization Conference\", where it decided to rebuild the party with the maintaining of its identity and by reviewing the path that it had followed in the precedent years. The party then started a battle in order to gain the rights to use the name Brazilian Communist Party and the acronym PCB (which was contested by the members of the PPS) and to legalize the party. In 1996, the PCB would be officially registered.\n\nThe Party has realized four congresses since then: the 10th (1993), 11th (1996), 12th (2000) and the 13th (2006). It remains small, in spite of some recent growth during the government of [[Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] and the crisis of [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] (it should be noticed that the main result of this process was the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]]). Although competing in elections and participating in wider electoral fronts, its electoral results were insignificant.\n\nIn 2006, the PCB agreed on a nationwide alliance with two other left-wing parties, [[Socialism and Liberty Party|PSOL]] and [[United Socialist Workers' Party|PSTU]]. Putting aside some significant ideological differences, the three parties built a common agenda to try to break the polarity between presidential candidates [[Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] ([[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]]) and [[Geraldo Alckmin]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]). The coalition also extended to gubernatorial and parliament elections to take place at the same time all over the country.\nThe PCB elected a state deputy (Jorge Souza, in the state of [[Amap\u00e1]]) and has about 20 local representatives.\n\nThe party's union branch currently builds the central Intersindical and is growing greatly in the union movement. The student movement is responsibility of the Young Communist Union, which is also growing in size.\n\nThe last party's Congress, the 13th, in 2005, voted to abolish the post of \"president\" and use only the traditional position of \"secretary-general\".\n\n==Electoral results==\n===Presidential elections===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-----\n! align=\"center\" | Year\n! align=\"center\" | Candidate \n! align=\"center\" | Votes\n! align=\"center\" | %\n|-----\n| [[1945 Brazilian general election|1945]] \n| [[Yedo Fi\u00faza]]\n| align=\"center\" | 569,818\n| align=\"center\" | 9.70% \n|-----\n| [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989]] \n| [[Roberto Freire (politician)|Roberto Freire]] \n| align=\"center\" | 769,123\n| align=\"center\" | 1.10% \n|-----\n| [[2006 Brazilian presidential election|2006]] \n| No candidate, endorsed [[Helo\u00edsa Helena (politician)|Helo\u00edsa Helena]]\n| align=\"center\" | n/a\n| align=\"center\" | n/a \n|-----\n| [[2010 Brazilian presidential election|2010]] \n| [[Ivan Pinheiro]] \n| align=\"center\" | 39,136\n| align=\"center\" | 0.04% \n|-----\n| [[2014 Brazilian presidential election|2014]] \n| Mauro Iasi\n| align=\"center\" | 47,845\n| align=\"center\" | 0.05% \n|-----\n| [[2018 Brazilian presidential election|2018]] \n| No candidate, endorsed [[Guilherme Boulos]]\n| align=\"center\" | n/a\n| align=\"center\" | n/a\n|-----\n|}\n\n===Parliamentary elections===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-----\n! align=\"center\" | Year\n! align=\"center\" | Elections \n! align=\"center\" | Votes\n! align=\"center\" | %\n! align=\"center\" | Seats\n|-----\n| rowspan=2 |1945 \n| Chamber of Deputies  \n| align=\"center\" | 511.302\n| align=\"center\" | 8.45% \n| align=\"center\" | 14\n|-----\n| Federal Senate\n| align=\"center\" | 1.095.843\n| align=\"center\" | 9.73% \n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-----\n| rowspan=2| 1947\n| Chamber of Deputies  \n| align=\"center\" | 479.024\n| align=\"center\" | 9.2% \n| align=\"center\" | 2 *\n|-----\n| Federal Senate\n| align=\"center\" | 151.182\n| align=\"center\" | 2.5% \n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|-----\n| rowspan=2 | 1986\n| Chamber of Deputies  \n| align=\"center\" | 380,592\n| align=\"center\" | 0.8% \n| align=\"center\" | 3\n|-----\n| Federal Senate **\n| align=\"center\" | -\n| align=\"center\" | - \n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-----\n| rowspan=2 | 1990 \n| Chamber of Deputies \n| align=\"center\" | \n| align=\"center\" |  \n| align=\"center\" | 3\n|-----\n| Federal Senate\n| align=\"center\" | \n| align=\"center\" |  \n| align=\"center\" | \n|-----\n|}\n{{small|*}} The 1947 elections had just a complementary character at the federal level (since the deputies elected in 1945 had mandates until 1950) and elected the State Chambers according to the new Constitution.

These included the [[Cyprus Emergency]] of 1955\u201359 during British rule, the post-independence [[Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364]], and the [[Cyprus crisis of 1967]]. Hostilities culminated in the 1974 ''de facto'' division of the island along the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line]] following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. The region has been relatively peaceful since then, but the [[Cyprus dispute]] has continued, with various attempts to solve it diplomatically having been generally unsuccessful.\n\n==Background==\n\nCyprus, an island lying in the eastern Mediterranean, hosted a population of Greeks and Turks (four-fifths and one fifth respectively) living under British rule in the early 20th century.{{sfn|James|2001|pp=3-5}} Christian Orthodox Church of Cyprus played a prominent political role among the Greek Cypriot community, a privilege it acquired during the Ottoman Era with the employment of the millet system, so the archbishop had an unofficial ethnarch status.{{sfn|James|2001|pp=6}}\n\n===''Enosis'' and ''Taksim''===\nThe repeated rejections by the British of Greek Cypriot demands for ''enosis'', annexation by Greece, led to armed resistance organized by a group known as the National Organization of Cypriot Struggle, or [[EOKA]].<ref name=Encarta>\"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578820_6/Cyprus.html Cyprus],\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007.

One of the effects of the EOKA campaign was to alter the Turkish position from demanding full reincorporation into Turkey to a demand for ''[[Taksim (politics)|taksim]]'' (partition). EOKA mission and activities caused a \"Cretan syndrome\" (see [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]]) within the Turkish Cypriot community, as its members feared that they would be forced to leave the island in such a case as was the case with [[Cretan Turks]]; as such, they preferred the continuation of the British rule and later, taksim, the division of the island. Due to the Turkish Cypriots' support for the British, the EOKA leader Georgios Grivas declared them an enemy.<ref>Sachenko, Daria (2012).

Further, as Lindlay writes \"the merging of church, schools/education, and politics in divisive and nationalistic ways\" had played a crucial role in creation of a havoc in Cyprus history.{{sfn|Lindley|2007|p=239}} Also, Attalides Michael pointed to the opposing nationalism as the cause of the Cyprus problem.{{sfn|Yildizian|Ehteshami|2004|p=4}}\n\n== Crisis of 1955\u20131959 ==\n{{main|Cyprus Emergency}}\nThe British started recruiting Turkish Cypriots into the police force that patrolled Cyprus to fight the EOKA. EOKA targeted colonial authorities, including police, but [[Georgios Grivas]], the leader of EOKA, did not initially wish to open up a new front by fighting Turkish Cypriots and reassured them that EOKA would not harm their people. In 1956, some Turkish Cypriot policemen were killed by EOKA members and this provoked some intercommunal violence in the spring and summer, but these attacks on policemen were not motivated by the fact that they were Turkish Cypriots. However, in January 1957, Grivas changed his policy as his forces in the mountains became increasingly pressured by the British forces. In order to divert the attention of the British forces, EOKA members started to target Turkish Cypriot policemen intentionally in the towns, so that Turkish Cypriots would riot against the Greek Cypriots and the security forces would have to be diverted to the towns to restore order. The killing of a Turkish Cypriot policeman on 19 January, when a power station was bombed, and the injury of three others, provoked three days of intercommunal violence in Nicosia. The two communities targeted each other in reprisals, at least one Greek Cypriot was killed and the army was deployed in the streets.<ref name=French258>{{cite book|last1=French|first1=David|title=Fighting EOKA: The British Counter-Insurgency Campaign on Cyprus, 1955-1959|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191045592|pages=258\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cmnuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA258}}</ref> Greek Cypriot stores were burned and their neighborhoods attacked.<ref name=\"Crawshaw, Nancy 1978\"/> Following the events, the Greek Cypriot leadership spread the propaganda that the riots had merely been an act of Turkish Cypriot aggression.<ref name=French258/> Such events created chaos and drove the communities apart both in Cyprus and in Turkey.<ref name=\"Crawshaw, Nancy 1978\">Crawshaw, Nancy.

Foot suggested five to seven years of self-government before any final decision. His plan rejected both ''enosis'' and ''taksim''. The Turkish Cypriot response to this plan was a series of anti-British demonstrations in [[Nicosia]] on 27 and 28 January 1958 rejecting the proposed plan because the plan did not include partition. The British then withdrew the plan.\n\nBy 1958 signs of dissatisfaction with the British increased on both sides, with Turkish Cypriots now forming Volkan, later known as the Turkish Resistance Organization paramilitary group to promote partition and the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as dictated by the Menderes plan.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nOn 27 January 1958 British soldiers opened fire against a crowd of Turkish Cypriot rioters. The events continued until the next day.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn June 1958 the British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] was expected to propose a plan to resolve the Cyprus issue. In light of the new development the Turks rioted in Nicosia to promote the idea that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could not live together and therefore any plan that did not include partition would not be viable. This violence was soon followed by bombing, Greek Cypriot deaths and looting of Greek Cypriot-owned stores and houses. Greek and Turkish Cypriots started to flee mixed population villages where they were a minority in search of safety. This was effectively the beginning of segregation of the two communities.<ref name=\"Crawshaw, Nancy 1978\"/> On 7 June 1958 a bomb exploded at the entrance of the Turkish Embassy in Cyprus.

Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop  [[Makarios III]] now set independence for the island as his objective.<ref>David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.2</ref>\n\nBritain resolved to solve the dispute by creating an independent Cypriot state. In 1959 all involved parties signed the Zurich agreements: Britain, Turkey, Greece, and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, Makarios and Dr. [[Fazil Kucuk]] respectively. The new constitution drew heavily on the ethnic composition of the island. The President would be a Greek Cypriot and the Vice-President a Turkish Cypriot with an equal veto. The contribution to the public service would be set at a ratio of 70:30, and the Supreme Court would consist of an equal number of judges from both communities plus an independent judge who was not Greek, Turkish or British. The Zurich accords were supplemented by a number of treaties. The [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]] stated that secession or union with any state was forbidden, and that Greece, Turkey and Britain would be given guarantor status to intervene should this be violated. The [[Treaty of Alliance (1960)|Treaty of Alliance]] allowed for two small Greek and Turkish military contingents to be stationed on the island whilst the Treaty of Establishment gave Britain sovereignty over two bases in [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].\n\nOn August 15, 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed.\n\nThe new constitution brought dissatisfaction to Greek Cypriots that felt that it was highly unjust for them, for historical, demographic and contributional reasons. While 80% of the island were Greek Cypriots and Greek Cypriots were the vast majority and indigenous people of the island for thousands of years, plus contributing to 94% percent of the taxes, the new constitution was giving the 17% of Turkish Cypriots, with a 6% contribution to the taxes, 30% of the government jobs and 40% of the national security jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccha-ahdr.info./items/show/768 |title=Cyprus Critical History Archive: Reconsidering the culture of violence in Cyprus, 1955-64 &#124; What Greeks and Turks contribute to the government revenue |publisher=Ccha-ahdr.info. |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Crisis of 1963\u20131964 ==\n<!--The above section header \"Crisis of 1963\u20131964\" is currently (April 2019) the target of a redirect, \"Cyprus crisis of 1963\u20131964\" and \"Cyprus crisis of 1963-1964\".

Makarios subsequently declared his intention to ignore the judgement, resulting in the West German judge resigning from his position.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Michael|title=Cyprus: Two Nations in One Island|url=http://www.mediaprof.org/tcvoices/bowwhole.txt|accessdate=9 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703214001/http://www.mediaprof.org/tcvoices/bowwhole.txt|archivedate=3 July 2007|format=TXT|year=1987}}</ref> Makarios proposed [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen amendments to the constitution]], which would have had the effect of resolving most of the issues in the Greek Cypriot favour.<ref>[http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/narrative-main-%203.html The Cyprus Conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217102905/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/narrative-main-%203.html |date=2007-02-17 }}, ''The Main Narrative'', by Keith Kyle</ref> Under the proposals, the President and Vice President would lose their veto, the separate municipalities as sought after by the Turkish Cypriots would be abandoned, the need for separate majorities by both communities in passing legislation would be discarded and the civil service contribution would be set at actual population ratios (82:18) instead of the slightly higher figure for Turkish Cypriots.\n\nThe intention behind the amendments has long been called into question. The [[Akritas plan]], written in the height of the constitutional dispute by the Greek Cypriot interior minister [[Polycarpos Georkadjis]], called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating \u201cIn the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, it is imperative to overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, because if we succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.\u201d<ref>[http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/akritas_plan.html The Cyprus Conflict], ''The Akritas Plan''</ref> Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards ''enosis'' had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as \"a step on the road to ''enosis''\".<ref>David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.3</ref> Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing ''taksim'' (partition) the best safeguard against ''enosis''.\n\nGreek Cypriots however believe the amendments were a necessity stemming from a perceived attempt by Turkish Cypriots to frustrate the working of government. Turkish Cypriots saw it as a means to reduce their status within the state from one of co-founder to that of minority, seeing it as a first step towards enosis. The security situation deteriorated rapidly.\n\n===Intercommunal violence===\n{{main|Bloody Christmas (1963)|Battle of Tillyria}}\nAn armed conflict was triggered after December 21, 1963, a period remembered by Turkish Cypriots as [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|Bloody Christmas]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Ali Carkoglu|title=Turkey and the European Union: Domestic Politics, Economic Integration and International Dynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-IIzJty4sYC&pg=PA67|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-7146-8335-5|page=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Salomon Ruysdael|title=New Trends in Turkish Foreign Affairs: Bridges and Boundaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmLPR0-a8tEC&pg=PA299|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=1 September 2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24494-2|pages=299\u2013}}</ref>, when a Greek Cypriot policemen that had been called to help deal with a taxi driver refusing officers already on the scene access to check the identification documents of his customers, took out his gun upon arrival and shot and killed the taxi driver and his partner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Her \u015fey buradan ba\u015flad\u0131 [Everything started here]|url=http://www.havadiskibris.com/her-sey-buradan-basladi/|publisher=Havadis|accessdate=28 March 2017|date=21 December 2014}}</ref> Eric Solsten summarized the events as follows: \"a Greek Cypriot police patrol, ostensibly checking identification documents, stopped a Turkish Cypriot couple on the edge of the Turkish quarter.

On the 23rd, a ceasefire was negotiated, but did not hold. Fighting, including automatic weapons fire, between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and militias increased in Nicosia and [[Larnaca]]. A force of Greek Cypriot [[Irregular military|irregulars]] led by [[Nikos Sampson]] entered the Nicosia suburb of [[Omorphita]] and engaged in heavy firing on armed, as well as by some accounts unarmed, Turkish Cypriots.

Turkey was dissuaded from direct involvement by the creation of a [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP) in 1964. Despite the negotiated ceasefire in Nicosia, attacks on the Turkish Cypriot persisted, particularly in Limassol. Concerned about the possibility of a Turkish invasion, Makarios undertook the creation of a Greek Cypriot conscript-based army called the \u201cNational Guard\u201d. A general from Greece took charge of the army, whilst a further 20,000 well-equipped officers and men were smuggled from Greece into Cyprus. Turkey threatened to intervene once more, but was prevented by a strongly worded  letter from the American President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], anxious to avoid a conflict between [[NATO]] allies Greece and Turkey at the height of the [[Cold War]].\n\nTurkish Cypriots had by now established an important bridgehead at [[Kokkina]], provided with arms, volunteers and materials from Turkey and abroad. Seeing this incursion of foreign weapons and troops as a major threat, the Cypriot government invited George Grivas to return from Greece as commander of the Greek troops on the island and launch a major attack on the bridgehead. Turkey retaliated by dispatching its fighter jets to bomb Greek positions, causing Makarios to threaten an attack on every Turkish Cypriot village on the island if the bombings did not cease.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/10/newsid_3037000/3037898.stm]\nBBC On This Day.\n1964: Guns fall silent in Cyprus</ref> The conflict had now drawn in Greece and Turkey, with both countries amassing troops on their Thracian borders. Efforts at mediation by [[Dean Acheson]], a former [[U.S. Secretary of State]], and UN-appointed mediator [[Galo Plaza]] had failed, all the while the division of the two communities becoming more apparent. Greek Cypriot forces were estimated at some 30,000, including the National Guard and the large contingent from Greece. Defending the Turkish Cypriot enclaves was a force of approximately 5,000 irregulars, led by a Turkish colonel, but lacking the equipment and organization of the Greek forces.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1964, [[U Thant]], reported the damage during the conflicts:\n\n:''UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances; it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish-Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting''.<ref>[https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Cyprus%20S%205950.pdf Report S/5950 (10 September 1964), page 48, paragraph 180]</ref>\n\n== Crisis of 1967 ==\nThe situation worsened in 1967, when a [[military junta]] overthrew the democratically elected government of Greece, and began applying pressure on Makarios to achieve ''enosis''. Makarios, not wishing to become part of a military dictatorship or trigger a Turkish invasion, began to distance himself from the goal of ''enosis''. This caused tensions with the junta in Greece as well as George Grivas in Cyprus. Grivas's control over the National Guard and Greek contingent was seen as a threat to Makarios's position, who now feared a possible coup. Grivas escalated the conflict when his armed units began patrolling the Turkish Cypriot enclaves of Ayios Theodhoros and Kophinou, and on November 15 engaged in heavy fighting with the Turkish Cypriots.\n\nBy the time of his withdrawal 26 Turkish Cypriots had been killed.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cy0023) Country Studies]: Cyprus - Intercommunal Violence {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108125029/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+cy0023%29 |date=8 November 2004 }}</ref> Turkey replied with an ultimatum demanding that Grivas be removed from the island, that the troops smuggled from Greece in excess of the limits of the Treaty of Alliance be removed, and that the economic blockades on the Turkish Cypriot enclaves be lifted. Grivas resigned his position and 12,000 Greek troops were withdrawn. Makarios now attempted to consolidate his position by reducing the number of National Guard troops, and by creating a paramilitary force loyal to Cypriot independence. In 1968, acknowledging that ''enosis'' was now all but impossible, Makarios stated, \"A solution by necessity must be sought within the limits of what is feasible which does not always coincide with the limits of what is desirable.\"\n\n==Greek coup==\n {{main|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nAfter 1967 tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots subsided. Instead, the main source of tension on the island came from factions within the Greek Cypriot community. Although Makarios had effectively abandoned ''enosis'' in favour of an \u2018attainable solution\u2019, many others continued to believe that the only legitimate political aspiration for Greek Cypriots was union with Greece. Makarios was branded a traitor to the cause by Grivas and, in 1971, he made a clandestine return to the island.\n\nOn his arrival, Grivas began by establishing a nationalist paramilitary group known as the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston B or [[EOKA#EOKA-B|EOKA-B]]), drawing comparisons with the EOKA struggle for ''enosis'' under the British colonial administration of the 1950s.\n\nThe military junta in Athens saw Makarios as an obstacle, and directed funds to Grivas to carry out a number of attacks and to fund a propaganda campaign through the creation of pro-''enosis'' newspapers. Makarios's failure to disband the National Guard, whose officer class was dominated by mainland Greeks, had meant the junta had practical control over the Cypriot military establishment, leaving Makarios isolated and a vulnerable target.\n\n==Turkish invasion==\n {{main|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Modern history of Cyprus]]\n* [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=James|first=Alan|title=Keeping the Peace in the Cyprus Crisis of 1963\u201364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2CIDAAAQBAJ|date=28 November 2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-4039-0089-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal | last=Lindley| first=Dan | title=Historical, Tactical, and Strategic Lessons from the Partition of Cyprus | journal=International Studies Perspectives | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=8 | issue=2 | year=2007 | issn=1528-3577 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-3585.2007.00282.x | pages=224\u2013241 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal | last1=Yildizian|first1= Arax-Marie|last2=Ehteshami|first2= A. |year=2004|title= Ethnic Conflict in Cyprus and the Contact Hypothesis: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228677594| ref=harv}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Chapter-VII-S-5950.pdf Report s/5950 (10 September 1964) by the Secretary-General]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140112082705/http://cyprus-conflict.net/ Cyprus-Conflict.net] An independent and comprehensive website dedicated to the Cyprus conflict, containing a detailed narrative as well as documents, reports and eye-witness accounts.\n* [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cytoc.html#cy0024 Library of Congress Cyprus Country Study] Detailed information on Cyprus, covering the various phases of the Cyprus conflict.\n\n{{Foreign relations of Northern Cyprus}}\n{{Foreign relations of Cyprus}}\n{{Cyprus dispute}}\n{{Cyprus topics}}\n{{Middle East conflicts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cypriot Intercommunal Violence}}\n[[Category:20th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:1955 in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:1958 in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:1963 in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:1964 in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Cyprus dispute|Intercommunal violence]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Asia]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Europe]]\n[[Category:Civil wars post-1945]]\n[[Category:Ethnicity-based civil wars]]\n[[Category:Sectarian violence]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1955]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1956]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1957]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1958]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1959]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1960]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1961]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1962]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1963]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1964]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Violence between ethnic communities in Cyprus}}\n{{Campaignbox Cyprus dispute}}\n\nSeveral distinct periods of '''Cypriot intercommunal violence''' involving the two main ethnic communities, [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]], marked mid-20th century [[Cyprus]].

EOKA mission and activities caused a \"Cretan syndrome\" (see [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]]) within the Turkish Cypriot community, as its members feared that they would be forced to leave the island in such a case as was the case with [[Cretan Turks]]; as such, they preferred the continuation of the British rule and later, taksim, the division of the island.

EOKA targeted colonial authorities, including police, but [[Georgios Grivas]], the leader of EOKA, did not initially wish to open up a new front by fighting Turkish Cypriots and reassured them that EOKA would not harm their people. In 1956, some Turkish Cypriot policemen were killed by EOKA members and this provoked some intercommunal violence in the spring and summer, but these attacks on policemen were not motivated by the fact that they were Turkish Cypriots. However, in January 1957, Grivas changed his policy as his forces in the mountains became increasingly pressured by the British forces. In order to divert the attention of the British forces, EOKA members started to target Turkish Cypriot policemen intentionally in the towns, so that Turkish Cypriots would riot against the Greek Cypriots and the security forces would have to be diverted to the towns to restore order. The killing of a Turkish Cypriot policeman on 19 January, when a power station was bombed, and the injury of three others, provoked three days of intercommunal violence in Nicosia. The two communities targeted each other in reprisals, at least one Greek Cypriot was killed and the army was deployed in the streets.<ref name=French258>{{cite book|last1=French|first1=David|title=Fighting EOKA: The British Counter-Insurgency Campaign on Cyprus, 1955-1959|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191045592|pages=258\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cmnuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA258}}</ref> Greek Cypriot stores were burned and their neighborhoods attacked.<ref name=\"Crawshaw, Nancy 1978\"/> Following the events, the Greek Cypriot leadership spread the propaganda that the riots had merely been an act of Turkish Cypriot aggression.<ref name=French258/> Such events created chaos and drove the communities apart both in Cyprus and in Turkey.<ref name=\"Crawshaw, Nancy 1978\">Crawshaw, Nancy.

Foot suggested five to seven years of self-government before any final decision. His plan rejected both ''enosis'' and ''taksim''. The Turkish Cypriot response to this plan was a series of anti-British demonstrations in [[Nicosia]] on 27 and 28 January 1958 rejecting the proposed plan because the plan did not include partition. The British then withdrew the plan.\n\nBy 1958 signs of dissatisfaction with the British increased on both sides, with Turkish Cypriots now forming Volkan, later known as the Turkish Resistance Organization paramilitary group to promote partition and the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as dictated by the Menderes plan.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nOn 27 January 1958 British soldiers opened fire against a crowd of Turkish Cypriot rioters.

In light of the new development the Turks rioted in Nicosia to promote the idea that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could not live together and therefore any plan that did not include partition would not be viable. This violence was soon followed by bombing, Greek Cypriot deaths and looting of Greek Cypriot-owned stores and houses.

Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop  [[Makarios III]] now set independence for the island as his objective.<ref>David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.2</ref>\n\nBritain resolved to solve the dispute by creating an independent Cypriot state. In 1959 all involved parties signed the Zurich agreements: Britain, Turkey, Greece, and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, Makarios and Dr. [[Fazil Kucuk]] respectively. The new constitution drew heavily on the ethnic composition of the island. The President would be a Greek Cypriot and the Vice-President a Turkish Cypriot with an equal veto. The contribution to the public service would be set at a ratio of 70:30, and the Supreme Court would consist of an equal number of judges from both communities plus an independent judge who was not Greek, Turkish or British. The Zurich accords were supplemented by a number of treaties. The [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]] stated that secession or union with any state was forbidden, and that Greece, Turkey and Britain would be given guarantor status to intervene should this be violated. The [[Treaty of Alliance (1960)|Treaty of Alliance]] allowed for two small Greek and Turkish military contingents to be stationed on the island whilst the Treaty of Establishment gave Britain sovereignty over two bases in [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].\n\nOn August 15, 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed.\n\nThe new constitution brought dissatisfaction to Greek Cypriots that felt that it was highly unjust for them, for historical, demographic and contributional reasons. While 80% of the island were Greek Cypriots and Greek Cypriots were the vast majority and indigenous people of the island for thousands of years, plus contributing to 94% percent of the taxes, the new constitution was giving the 17% of Turkish Cypriots, with a 6% contribution to the taxes, 30% of the government jobs and 40% of the national security jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccha-ahdr.info./items/show/768 |title=Cyprus Critical History Archive: Reconsidering the culture of violence in Cyprus, 1955-64 &#124; What Greeks and Turks contribute to the government revenue |publisher=Ccha-ahdr.info. |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Crisis of 1963\u20131964 ==\n<!--The above section header \"Crisis of 1963\u20131964\" is currently (April 2019) the target of a redirect, \"Cyprus crisis of 1963\u20131964\" and \"Cyprus crisis of 1963-1964\".

In particular disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. A constitutional court ruled in 1963 Makarios had failed to uphold article 173 of the constitution which called for the establishment of separate municipalities for Turkish Cypriots. Makarios subsequently declared his intention to ignore the judgement, resulting in the West German judge resigning from his position.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Michael|title=Cyprus: Two Nations in One Island|url=http://www.mediaprof.org/tcvoices/bowwhole.txt|accessdate=9 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703214001/http://www.mediaprof.org/tcvoices/bowwhole.txt|archivedate=3 July 2007|format=TXT|year=1987}}</ref> Makarios proposed [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen amendments to the constitution]], which would have had the effect of resolving most of the issues in the Greek Cypriot favour.<ref>[http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/narrative-main-%203.html The Cyprus Conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217102905/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/narrative-main-%203.html |date=2007-02-17 }}, ''The Main Narrative'', by Keith Kyle</ref> Under the proposals, the President and Vice President would lose their veto, the separate municipalities as sought after by the Turkish Cypriots would be abandoned, the need for separate majorities by both communities in passing legislation would be discarded and the civil service contribution would be set at actual population ratios (82:18) instead of the slightly higher figure for Turkish Cypriots.\n\nThe intention behind the amendments has long been called into question. The [[Akritas plan]], written in the height of the constitutional dispute by the Greek Cypriot interior minister [[Polycarpos Georkadjis]], called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating \u201cIn the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, it is imperative to overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, because if we succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.\u201d<ref>[http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/www.cyprus-conflict.net/akritas_plan.html The Cyprus Conflict], ''The Akritas Plan''</ref> Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards ''enosis'' had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as \"a step on the road to ''enosis''\".<ref>David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.3</ref> Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing ''taksim'' (partition) the best safeguard against ''enosis''.\n\nGreek Cypriots however believe the amendments were a necessity stemming from a perceived attempt by Turkish Cypriots to frustrate the working of government. Turkish Cypriots saw it as a means to reduce their status within the state from one of co-founder to that of minority, seeing it as a first step towards enosis. The security situation deteriorated rapidly.\n\n===Intercommunal violence===\n{{main|Bloody Christmas (1963)|Battle of Tillyria}}\nAn armed conflict was triggered after December 21, 1963, a period remembered by Turkish Cypriots as [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|Bloody Christmas]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Ali Carkoglu|title=Turkey and the European Union: Domestic Politics, Economic Integration and International Dynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-IIzJty4sYC&pg=PA67|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-7146-8335-5|page=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Salomon Ruysdael|title=New Trends in Turkish Foreign Affairs: Bridges and Boundaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmLPR0-a8tEC&pg=PA299|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=1 September 2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24494-2|pages=299\u2013}}</ref>, when a Greek Cypriot policemen that had been called to help deal with a taxi driver refusing officers already on the scene access to check the identification documents of his customers, took out his gun upon arrival and shot and killed the taxi driver and his partner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Her \u015fey buradan ba\u015flad\u0131 [Everything started here]|url=http://www.havadiskibris.com/her-sey-buradan-basladi/|publisher=Havadis|accessdate=28 March 2017|date=21 December 2014}}</ref> Eric Solsten summarized the events as follows: \"a Greek Cypriot police patrol, ostensibly checking identification documents, stopped a Turkish Cypriot couple on the edge of the Turkish quarter.

On the 23rd, a ceasefire was negotiated, but did not hold. Fighting, including automatic weapons fire, between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and militias increased in Nicosia and [[Larnaca]]. A force of Greek Cypriot [[Irregular military|irregulars]] led by [[Nikos Sampson]] entered the Nicosia suburb of [[Omorphita]] and engaged in heavy firing on armed, as well as by some accounts unarmed, Turkish Cypriots.

Turkey was dissuaded from direct involvement by the creation of a [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP) in 1964. Despite the negotiated ceasefire in Nicosia, attacks on the Turkish Cypriot persisted, particularly in Limassol. Concerned about the possibility of a Turkish invasion, Makarios undertook the creation of a Greek Cypriot conscript-based army called the \u201cNational Guard\u201d. A general from Greece took charge of the army, whilst a further 20,000 well-equipped officers and men were smuggled from Greece into Cyprus. Turkey threatened to intervene once more, but was prevented by a strongly worded  letter from the American President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], anxious to avoid a conflict between [[NATO]] allies Greece and Turkey at the height of the [[Cold War]].\n\nTurkish Cypriots had by now established an important bridgehead at [[Kokkina]], provided with arms, volunteers and materials from Turkey and abroad. Seeing this incursion of foreign weapons and troops as a major threat, the Cypriot government invited George Grivas to return from Greece as commander of the Greek troops on the island and launch a major attack on the bridgehead. Turkey retaliated by dispatching its fighter jets to bomb Greek positions, causing Makarios to threaten an attack on every Turkish Cypriot village on the island if the bombings did not cease.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/10/newsid_3037000/3037898.stm]\nBBC On This Day.\n1964: Guns fall silent in Cyprus</ref> The conflict had now drawn in Greece and Turkey, with both countries amassing troops on their Thracian borders. Efforts at mediation by [[Dean Acheson]], a former [[U.S. Secretary of State]], and UN-appointed mediator [[Galo Plaza]] had failed, all the while the division of the two communities becoming more apparent. Greek Cypriot forces were estimated at some 30,000, including the National Guard and the large contingent from Greece. Defending the Turkish Cypriot enclaves was a force of approximately 5,000 irregulars, led by a Turkish colonel, but lacking the equipment and organization of the Greek forces.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1964, [[U Thant]], reported the damage during the conflicts:\n\n:''UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances; it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish-Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting''.<ref>[https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Cyprus%20S%205950.pdf Report S/5950 (10 September 1964), page 48, paragraph 180]</ref>\n\n== Crisis of 1967 ==\nThe situation worsened in 1967, when a [[military junta]] overthrew the democratically elected government of Greece, and began applying pressure on Makarios to achieve ''enosis''. Makarios, not wishing to become part of a military dictatorship or trigger a Turkish invasion, began to distance himself from the goal of ''enosis''. This caused tensions with the junta in Greece as well as George Grivas in Cyprus. Grivas's control over the National Guard and Greek contingent was seen as a threat to Makarios's position, who now feared a possible coup. Grivas escalated the conflict when his armed units began patrolling the Turkish Cypriot enclaves of Ayios Theodhoros and Kophinou, and on November 15 engaged in heavy fighting with the Turkish Cypriots.\n\nBy the time of his withdrawal 26 Turkish Cypriots had been killed.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cy0023) Country Studies]: Cyprus - Intercommunal Violence {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108125029/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+cy0023%29 |date=8 November 2004 }}</ref> Turkey replied with an ultimatum demanding that Grivas be removed from the island, that the troops smuggled from Greece in excess of the limits of the Treaty of Alliance be removed, and that the economic blockades on the Turkish Cypriot enclaves be lifted. Grivas resigned his position and 12,000 Greek troops were withdrawn. Makarios now attempted to consolidate his position by reducing the number of National Guard troops, and by creating a paramilitary force loyal to Cypriot independence. In 1968, acknowledging that ''enosis'' was now all but impossible, Makarios stated, \"A solution by necessity must be sought within the limits of what is feasible which does not always coincide with the limits of what is desirable.\"\n\n==Greek coup==\n {{main|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nAfter 1967 tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots subsided. Instead, the main source of tension on the island came from factions within the Greek Cypriot community. Although Makarios had effectively abandoned ''enosis'' in favour of an \u2018attainable solution\u2019, many others continued to believe that the only legitimate political aspiration for Greek Cypriots was union with Greece. Makarios was branded a traitor to the cause by Grivas and, in 1971, he made a clandestine return to the island.\n\nOn his arrival, Grivas began by establishing a nationalist paramilitary group known as the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston B or [[EOKA#EOKA-B|EOKA-B]]), drawing comparisons with the EOKA struggle for ''enosis'' under the British colonial administration of the 1950s.\n\nThe military junta in Athens saw Makarios as an obstacle, and directed funds to Grivas to carry out a number of attacks and to fund a propaganda campaign through the creation of pro-''enosis'' newspapers.
