He averaged 10.9 points and 5.3 assists, which did not meet his career averages of 11.7 and 6.5. His play dropped dramatically in the postseason, averaging 5.8 points per game and 3.5 assists per game. His struggles contributed to the Heat being swept by the Bulls in four games in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Williams played 67 games while averaging 8.7 points and 4.6 assists per game. He shot 41.5 percent from the field, 86.3 percent from the free-throw line, and 35.3 percent from beyond the three-point arc. In March, he had 34 points versus Orlando, connecting on five three-point baskets. He had two double-doubles: one against Phoenix and one against the Bucks; both were 21-point, 10-assist performances.<ref>{{cite web| website= Basketball-Reference.com| url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willija02/gamelog/2008/ |title= Jason Williams 2007-08 Game Log| access-date= October 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement and return===\n[[File:Jason Williams Magic cropped.jpg|100px|thumbnail|right|Williams came out of retirement to play with the [[Orlando Magic]] in 2009]]\nIn the summer of 2008, Williams signed with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to a one-year deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3524422 |title=Clippers reach terms with free-agent guard Williams |publisher= ESPN| website= espn.go.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2019-07-08}}</ref> However, on September 26, 2008 Williams announced his retirement from the NBA after 10 years due to persistent injuries.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/jwilliams_retire_080926.html|title=Clippers Guard Jason Williams Announces Retirement After 10 Year NBA Career |first=|last=|date=September 26, 2008|work=[[Los Angeles Clippers]]|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, Williams announced he would attempt a return to the NBA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ys-williamscomeback021909 |title=NBA Basketball News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-07-08}}</ref> On August 19, 2009, Williams signed with the [[Orlando Magic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic Sign Free Agent Jason Williams| url= http://www.nba.com/magic/news/sign_williams_081909.html|work=[[Orlando Magic]]|publisher=NBA.com|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> The move reunited Williams with [[Stan Van Gundy]], his former coach in Miami, who pushed the team to make the signing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_magic/2009/08/stan-van-gundy-sees-similarities-between-jason-williams-and-rafer-alston.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 2, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090824030635/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_magic/2009/08/stan-van-gundy-sees-similarities-between-jason-williams-and-rafer-alston.html |archivedate=August 24, 2009}}</ref> Orlando was also located just south of Gainesville, where he had gone to college.\n\nWilliams played in all 82 games for the Magic that year, including 18 starts when [[Jameer Nelson]] was injured.

He became a regular on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' for his spectacular passes and dazzling assists. He regularly attempted, and mostly completed passes such as behind-the back, no-look and half-court. Popular user-generated Internet-video sites contain many \"home-made\" highlight videos dedicated solely to Williams' highlights. He was also known for taking spectacular three-point shots that drove home audiences wild. With his risky play, he was turnover-prone at times: in his second and fourth years, he peaked at over 3.5 per game. His playing style led Williams to be benched during crucial periods of some games. For example, in the [[2000 NBA Playoffs]], Williams sat out most of the fourth quarter in all five games against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nIn his later years with Memphis and Miami, he significantly tamed his extravagant playing style and consistently achieved one of the highest assists per turnover ratios in the NBA. Throughout his entire career, Williams continued to be known for his assists and for his creativity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebasketballfans.com/do-you-like-white-chocolate-basketball/|title=Do you like White Chocolate Basketball? - The Basketball Fans|date=July 18, 2018|work=The Basketball Fans|access-date=November 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge|Rookie Challenge]] of the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in 2000, in a counter-attack, Williams made a no-look, behind-the-back pass off the elbow on a full sprint to [[Raef LaFrentz]]. \"I did it so you all wouldn't ask me to ever do it again\", Williams said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/07/clip-of-the-morning-jason-williams-breaks-out-the-elbow-pass-to-scottie-pippen|title=Clip of the Morning: Jason Williams Breaks Out the Elbow Pass to Scottie Pippen|first=Jose|last=Martinez|date=July 21, 2012|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\nWilliams' nickname was \"White Chocolate\". The nickname was started in Williams' rookie year by Stephanie Shepard, a media relations assistant with the Sacramento Kings. \"I came up with that name because of his style\", Shepard said. \"He has flash and pizazz. The way he does things with the ball is incredible to me. It reminds me of, like, schoolyard street ball when I go to Chicago.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nDespite his NBA success, Williams preferred to stay out of the spotlight and live a low-key lifestyle, spending time with his family. Williams married Denika Kisty, a University of Florida alumna, a former member of the [[Florida Gators track and field]] team, and an All-American javelin thrower.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://web.gatorzone.com/trackfield/media/2008/pdf/women.pdf |title= 2008 University of Florida Track and Field Media Guide| website= gatorzone.com| publisher= | date= | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140929230529/http://web.gatorzone.com/trackfield/media/2008/pdf/women.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2014}}</ref> Williams and his wife have three children; in his NBA profile, he listed his family as his \"most treasured possession\".<ref name=nbaprofile/>\n\nWilliams is a close friend of former Miami Heat teammate and center [[Shaquille O'Neal]], having been neighbors in Orlando for three years. \"I was the one who helped broker the deal this summer\", O'Neal said (in 2005) of the five-team, 13-player trade that brought Williams to [[Miami]]. \"He wanted to play with me and I wanted to play with a guard who loves to pass and I think it'll be a good combination for myself and [guard] [[Dwyane Wade]].\"<ref>{{cite news| first= Chris |last= Perkins| title= Not Apologetic, Just Himself| work= [[The Palm Beach Post]]| date= October 10, 2005}}</ref>\n\nWilliams also has a number of tattoos, which include a panther on his right arm, a dragon on his left arm (which was redone in the 2007\u201308 season), an eye on his chest of which he said, \"It's why I pass so good, I have a 3rd eye\".

He averaged 10.9 points and 5.3 assists, which did not meet his career averages of 11.7 and 6.5. His play dropped dramatically in the postseason, averaging 5.8 points per game and 3.5 assists per game. His struggles contributed to the Heat being swept by the Bulls in four games in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Williams played 67 games while averaging 8.7 points and 4.6 assists per game. He shot 41.5 percent from the field, 86.3 percent from the free-throw line, and 35.3 percent from beyond the three-point arc. In March, he had 34 points versus Orlando, connecting on five three-point baskets. He had two double-doubles: one against Phoenix and one against the Bucks; both were 21-point, 10-assist performances.<ref>{{cite web| website= Basketball-Reference.com| url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willija02/gamelog/2008/ |title= Jason Williams 2007-08 Game Log| access-date= October 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement and return===\n[[File:Jason Williams Magic cropped.jpg|100px|thumbnail|right|Williams came out of retirement to play with the [[Orlando Magic]] in 2009]]\nIn the summer of 2008, Williams signed with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to a one-year deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3524422 |title=Clippers reach terms with free-agent guard Williams |publisher= ESPN| website= espn.go.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2019-07-08}}</ref> However, on September 26, 2008 Williams announced his retirement from the NBA after 10 years due to persistent injuries.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/jwilliams_retire_080926.html|title=Clippers Guard Jason Williams Announces Retirement After 10 Year NBA Career |first=|last=|date=September 26, 2008|work=[[Los Angeles Clippers]]|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, Williams announced he would attempt a return to the NBA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ys-williamscomeback021909 |title=NBA Basketball News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-07-08}}</ref> On August 19, 2009, Williams signed with the [[Orlando Magic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic Sign Free Agent Jason Williams| url= http://www.nba.com/magic/news/sign_williams_081909.html|work=[[Orlando Magic]]|publisher=NBA.com|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> The move reunited Williams with [[Stan Van Gundy]], his former coach in Miami, who pushed the team to make the signing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_magic/2009/08/stan-van-gundy-sees-similarities-between-jason-williams-and-rafer-alston.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 2, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090824030635/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_magic/2009/08/stan-van-gundy-sees-similarities-between-jason-williams-and-rafer-alston.html |archivedate=August 24, 2009}}</ref> Orlando was also located just south of Gainesville, where he had gone to college.\n\nWilliams played in all 82 games for the Magic that year, including 18 starts when [[Jameer Nelson]] was injured.

He became a regular on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' for his spectacular passes and dazzling assists. He regularly attempted, and mostly completed passes such as behind-the back, no-look and half-court. Popular user-generated Internet-video sites contain many \"home-made\" highlight videos dedicated solely to Williams' highlights. He was also known for taking spectacular three-point shots that drove home audiences wild. With his risky play, he was turnover-prone at times: in his second and fourth years, he peaked at over 3.5 per game. His playing style led Williams to be benched during crucial periods of some games. For example, in the [[2000 NBA Playoffs]], Williams sat out most of the fourth quarter in all five games against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nIn his later years with Memphis and Miami, he significantly tamed his extravagant playing style and consistently achieved one of the highest assists per turnover ratios in the NBA. Throughout his entire career, Williams continued to be known for his assists and for his creativity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebasketballfans.com/do-you-like-white-chocolate-basketball/|title=Do you like White Chocolate Basketball? - The Basketball Fans|date=July 18, 2018|work=The Basketball Fans|access-date=November 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge|Rookie Challenge]] of the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in 2000, in a counter-attack, Williams made a no-look, behind-the-back pass off the elbow on a full sprint to [[Raef LaFrentz]]. \"I did it so you all wouldn't ask me to ever do it again\", Williams said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/07/clip-of-the-morning-jason-williams-breaks-out-the-elbow-pass-to-scottie-pippen|title=Clip of the Morning: Jason Williams Breaks Out the Elbow Pass to Scottie Pippen|first=Jose|last=Martinez|date=July 21, 2012|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\nWilliams' nickname was \"White Chocolate\". The nickname was started in Williams' rookie year by Stephanie Shepard, a media relations assistant with the Sacramento Kings. \"I came up with that name because of his style\", Shepard said. \"He has flash and pizazz. The way he does things with the ball is incredible to me. It reminds me of, like, schoolyard street ball when I go to Chicago.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\nHe also had the nicknames \"J-Will\" and \"J-Dub\".\n\n==Personal life==\nDespite his NBA success, Williams preferred to stay out of the spotlight and live a low-key lifestyle, spending time with his family. Williams married Denika Kisty, a University of Florida alumna, a former member of the [[Florida Gators track and field]] team, and an All-American javelin thrower.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://web.gatorzone.com/trackfield/media/2008/pdf/women.pdf |title= 2008 University of Florida Track and Field Media Guide| website= gatorzone.com| publisher= | date= | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140929230529/http://web.gatorzone.com/trackfield/media/2008/pdf/women.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2014}}</ref> Williams and his wife have three children; in his NBA profile, he listed his family as his \"most treasured possession\".<ref name=nbaprofile/>\n\nWilliams is a close friend of former Miami Heat teammate and center [[Shaquille O'Neal]], having been neighbors in Orlando for three years. \"I was the one who helped broker the deal this summer\", O'Neal said (in 2005) of the five-team, 13-player trade that brought Williams to [[Miami]]. \"He wanted to play with me and I wanted to play with a guard who loves to pass and I think it'll be a good combination for myself and [guard] [[Dwyane Wade]].\"<ref>{{cite news| first= Chris |last= Perkins| title= Not Apologetic, Just Himself| work= [[The Palm Beach Post]]| date= October 10, 2005}}</ref>\n\nWilliams also has a number of tattoos, which include a panther on his right arm, a dragon on his left arm (which was redone in the 2007\u201308 season), an eye on his chest of which he said, \"It's why I pass so good, I have a 3rd eye\".

The case, decided in 1922, is the basis upon which baseball, unlike any other professional sport, still claims an exemption from federal antitrust laws.<ref name=JS/>\n\n===Coaching tree===\nMany of those who played on teams managed by Hanlon went on to careers as managers.

However, ''The Sporting News'' observed at the time that, when the Hall was ready to begin inducting the game's leading managers, Hanlon's place would be assured based on his accomplishments that had \"left an indelible print on the annals of the game.\"<ref name=TSN/>  Yet, even when the Hall began inducting managers, beginning in December 1937 with two of Hanlon's former players-turned-managers ([[John McGraw]] and [[Connie Mack]]), Hanlon was overlooked for another 59 years, though he was named to the Hall's [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]] in 1946.<ref>In December 1937, the Centennial Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame announced its inductees, including three managers, [[John McGraw]], [[Connie Mack]], and [[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]].  [[Cap Anson]] and [[Charles Comiskey]] were inducted two years later in 1939.  Two more Hanlon disciples, [[Wilbert Robinson]] and [[Hughie Jennings]], were inducted in 1945.  In the [[Veterans Committee#Honor Rolls of Baseball|1946 vote]] that led to the creation of the [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]], Hanlon received the 10th highest vote count.  Eight of the nine individual receiving more votes than Hanlon in that 1946 vote were granted full induction into the Hall of Fame by 1964 with the ninth, [[Bucky Harris]], being inducted in 1976.  Hanlon was not inducted until 1996.</ref>\n\nHanlon was not without nay-sayers who questioned his contributions to the championship teams in Baltimore and Brooklyn.  Some opined that the credit for the five pennants rested entirely with his Hall of Fame players\u2014John McGraw, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler.  In fact, Hanlon had a 304&ndash;441 ({{winperc|304|441|0}}) record in the portion of his career when he did not have Willie Keeler on his teams.<ref name=MGR>{{cite web|title=Ned Hanlon Managerial Career|work=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=July 6, 2014|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/hanlone01.shtml}}</ref><ref>Keeler played for Hanlon from 1894 to 1902.

Combining all seasons without Keeler, Hanlon's coaching record was 524-729 ({{winperc|524|729|0}}).</ref>  One prominent critic was [[Sam Crawford]] who was interviewed in the 1960s\u2014long after Hanlon and most of his colleagues had been deceased &ndash; for Lawrence Ritter's book, ''[[The Glory of Their Times]]''.  Although Crawford never played for Hanlon, and did not become a major league starter until 1900, Crawford made the following claim:<blockquote>Ned Hanlon used to manage that Baltimore club, but those old veterans didn't pay any attention to him.  Heck, they all knew baseball inside out... [T]hose old Baltimore Orioles didn't pay any more attention to Ned Hanlon, their manager, than they did to the batboy... He was a bench manager in civilian clothes.  When things would get a little tough in a game, Hanlon would sit there on the bench and wring his hands and start telling some of the old-timers what to do.  They'd look at him and say, 'For Christ's sake, just keep quiet and leave us alone. We'll win this ball game if you only shut up.'<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence S. Ritter|title=The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It|pages=52&ndash;53|publisher=William Morrow|year=1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1995, John Steadman of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' published an article urging Hanlon's induction.  Steadman pointed to Hanlon's strategic innovations as being worthy of the Hall, and suggested that Hanlon's omission may have been the result of having committed an \"unpardonable sin\" in suing Major League Baseball for violation of the antitrust laws.<ref name=JS>{{cite news|title=Shortchanged Hanlon brought baseball riches|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|author=John Steadman|date=February 15, 1995|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-02-15/sports/1995046172_1_ned-hanlon-federal-league-baltimore}}</ref>  In 1996, Hanlon was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame by vote of the [[Veterans Committee]].<ref name=HOF>{{cite web|title=Ned Hanlon Hall of Fame Profile|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=July 4, 2014|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/hanlon-ned}}</ref>\n\n==Family and later years==\nHanlon and his wife, Helen Jane Hanlon, had five children: Edward (born 1891), Joseph (born 1893), Mary (born 1895), Helen (born 1898), and Catherine Lillian (born c. 1903).<ref name=C00/><ref name=C10/>\n\nHanlon moved to [[Baltimore]] when he assumed control of the Orioles in 1892 and lived there for the rest of his life.

He was posthumously inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1996 by the [[Veterans Committee]].\n\nHanlon was a manager in [[Major League Baseball]] from 1889 to 1907, compiling a 1,313\u20131,164 (.530) record with five different clubs.  He is best remembered as the manager of the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] (1892\u20131898) and [[Brooklyn Superbas]] (1899\u20131905).  In the seven seasons from 1894 to 1900, Hanlon compiled a 635\u2013315 ({{Winning percentage|635|315}}) record, and his teams won five [[National League]] pennants.  During his years with the Orioles, Hanlon was also credited with inventing and perfecting the [[Inside baseball (strategy)|\"inside baseball\"]] strategy, including the [[Hit and run (baseball)|\"hit and run\"]] play and the [[Baltimore chop]].\n\nHanlon also played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a [[center fielder]].  He played in over 800 games as an outfielder for the [[Detroit Wolverines]], remaining with the team during all eight years of its existence from 1881 to 1888.

An official for the American Association called Hanlon's act in signing Bierbauer to be \"piratical.\" The Alleghenies contended that because \"the American Association did not reserve Bierbauer, he was a free agent\".

Hanlon and his co-owners in the Terrapins were not provided with any compensation, and the Terrapins thereupon sued the National and American Leagues for conspiring to monopolize baseball by buying the Federal League's other constituent clubs, thereby destroying the Federal League.  At trial, the defendants were found jointly liable, and damages of $80,000 assessed, which was tripled to $240,000 ($3,173,284 as of 2014), under the provisions of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The judgment was reversed on appeal, ultimately resulting in a United States Supreme Court decision, ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., holding that baseball was not interstate commerce and was therefore not subject to regulation, including antitrust regulation, by the federal government.  The case, decided in 1922, is the basis upon which baseball, unlike any other professional sport, still claims an exemption from federal antitrust laws.<ref name=JS/>\n\n===Coaching tree===\nMany of those who played on teams managed by Hanlon went on to careers as managers.

However, ''The Sporting News'' observed at the time that, when the Hall was ready to begin inducting the game's leading managers, Hanlon's place would be assured based on his accomplishments that had \"left an indelible print on the annals of the game.\"<ref name=TSN/>  Yet, even when the Hall began inducting managers, beginning in December 1937 with two of Hanlon's former players-turned-managers ([[John McGraw]] and [[Connie Mack]]), Hanlon was overlooked for another 59 years, though he was named to the Hall's [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]] in 1946.<ref>In December 1937, the Centennial Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame announced its inductees, including three managers, [[John McGraw]], [[Connie Mack]], and [[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]].  [[Cap Anson]] and [[Charles Comiskey]] were inducted two years later in 1939.  Two more Hanlon disciples, [[Wilbert Robinson]] and [[Hughie Jennings]], were inducted in 1945.  In the [[Veterans Committee#Honor Rolls of Baseball|1946 vote]] that led to the creation of the [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]], Hanlon received the 10th highest vote count.  Eight of the nine individual receiving more votes than Hanlon in that 1946 vote were granted full induction into the Hall of Fame by 1964 with the ninth, [[Bucky Harris]], being inducted in 1976.  Hanlon was not inducted until 1996.</ref>\n\nHanlon was not without nay-sayers who questioned his contributions to the championship teams in Baltimore and Brooklyn.  Some opined that the credit for the five pennants rested entirely with his Hall of Fame players\u2014John McGraw, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler.  In fact, Hanlon had a 304&ndash;441 ({{winperc|304|441|0}}) record in the portion of his career when he did not have Willie Keeler on his teams.<ref name=MGR>{{cite web|title=Ned Hanlon Managerial Career|work=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=July 6, 2014|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/hanlone01.shtml}}</ref><ref>Keeler played for Hanlon from 1894 to 1902.

Combining all seasons without Keeler, Hanlon's coaching record was 524-729 ({{winperc|524|729|0}}).</ref>  One prominent critic was [[Sam Crawford]] who was interviewed in the 1960s\u2014long after Hanlon and most of his colleagues had been deceased &ndash; for Lawrence Ritter's book, ''[[The Glory of Their Times]]''.  Although Crawford never played for Hanlon, and did not become a major league starter until 1900, Crawford made the following claim:<blockquote>Ned Hanlon used to manage that Baltimore club, but those old veterans didn't pay any attention to him.  Heck, they all knew baseball inside out... [T]hose old Baltimore Orioles didn't pay any more attention to Ned Hanlon, their manager, than they did to the batboy... He was a bench manager in civilian clothes.  When things would get a little tough in a game, Hanlon would sit there on the bench and wring his hands and start telling some of the old-timers what to do.  They'd look at him and say, 'For Christ's sake, just keep quiet and leave us alone. We'll win this ball game if you only shut up.'<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence S.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary.

At the event, the two fought in a secluded rural locale, in a cinematic narrative-heavy event, rather than a traditional wrestling match.

He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. He was managed by Paul Bearer, who used an urn to give Undertaker supernatural powers. During his early years, he used the Funeral March by Chopin as his entrance theme. WWF composer Jim Johnson changed the Chopin march to create a new theme, the Graveyard Symphony.<ref>https://superluchas.com/jim-johnston-habla-del-proceso-tras-el-tema-de-entrada-de-the-undertaker/</ref>\n\nWhen he made his return in 2000, he abandoned the somber mortician-themed attires, his [[Funeral march|funeral dirge ring music]], allusions to the supernatural and the accompanying morbid theatrics. In place of this, he took on a biker identity, riding to the ring on a motorcycle and wearing sunglasses and bandanas to the ring. His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, like [[Limp Bizkit]]'s \"[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\" and [[Kid Rock]]'s \"[[American Bad Ass]]\" (from which the name of The Undertaker's new gimmick originated), though it was accompanied by the characteristic opening bell of The Undertaker's original theme.\n\nIn 2020, Undertaker started a feud with AJ Styles. Styles claimed that, in the last months, Undertaker lost his mystique because he broke kayfabe in social media and shoot interviews. At WrestleMania 36, Undertaker presented a new character called \"The Unholy Trinity\", a mix of the supernatural, the American Bad Ass characters and the real-life person.<ref>https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/88886-undertaker-boneyard-match-por-mi-lo-hubiera-dejado-como-buried-alived</ref>\n\n== Legacy and reception ==\n[[File:Undertaker with Fire.jpg|thumb|The Undertaker in 2008]]\nThe Undertaker has been named one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/wwe/news/14203/11516978/wwe-analysis-is-the-undertaker-the-greatest-of-all-time|title=WWE Analysis: Is The Undertaker the greatest of all time?|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> The Undertaker was voted the greatest WWE wrestler ever in a 2013 [[Digital Spy]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Undertaker voted greatest WWE Superstar of all time|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s216/wwe/news/a482978/the-undertaker-voted-greatest-wwe-superstar-of-all-time.html#~plW3SSuMcxWtpS|publisher=Digital Spy UK|accessdate=August 21, 2015|date=May 20, 2013}}</ref> In naming him the second greatest wrestler ever, [[IGN]] described The Undertaker as, \"one of the most respected wrestlers, and characters, in the business; treated with actual reverence.

After signing for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he enjoyed a brief stint as a mid-card performer named \"Mean Mark\" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990. He is the longest-tenured wrestler in the company, having been performing for 30 years.\n\nIn the WWF, Calaway was rebranded as \"The Undertaker\" and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories at WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]].\n\nCalaway has held 17 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

He also eliminated [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] before being [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]]; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name).

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary.

At the event, the two fought in a secluded rural locale, in a cinematic narrative-heavy event, rather than a traditional wrestling match.

He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. He was managed by Paul Bearer, who used an urn to give Undertaker supernatural powers. During his early years, he used the Funeral March by Chopin as his entrance theme. WWF composer Jim Johnson changed the Chopin march to create a new theme, the Graveyard Symphony.<ref>https://superluchas.com/jim-johnston-habla-del-proceso-tras-el-tema-de-entrada-de-the-undertaker/</ref>\n\nWhen he made his return in 2000, he abandoned the somber mortician-themed attires, his [[Funeral march|funeral dirge ring music]], allusions to the supernatural and the accompanying morbid theatrics. In place of this, he took on a biker identity, riding to the ring on a motorcycle and wearing sunglasses and bandanas to the ring. His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, like [[Limp Bizkit]]'s \"[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\" and [[Kid Rock]]'s \"[[American Bad Ass]]\" (from which the name of The Undertaker's new gimmick originated), though it was accompanied by the characteristic opening bell of The Undertaker's original theme.\n\nIn 2020, Undertaker started a feud with AJ Styles. Styles claimed that, in the last months, Undertaker lost his mystique because he broke kayfabe in social media and shoot interviews. At WrestleMania 36, Undertaker presented a new character called \"The Unholy Trinity\", a mix of the supernatural, the American Bad Ass characters and the real-life person.<ref>https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/88886-undertaker-boneyard-match-por-mi-lo-hubiera-dejado-como-buried-alived</ref>\n\n== Legacy and reception ==\n[[File:Undertaker with Fire.jpg|thumb|The Undertaker in 2008]]\nThe Undertaker has been named one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/wwe/news/14203/11516978/wwe-analysis-is-the-undertaker-the-greatest-of-all-time|title=WWE Analysis: Is The Undertaker the greatest of all time?|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> The Undertaker was voted the greatest WWE wrestler ever in a 2013 [[Digital Spy]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Undertaker voted greatest WWE Superstar of all time|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s216/wwe/news/a482978/the-undertaker-voted-greatest-wwe-superstar-of-all-time.html#~plW3SSuMcxWtpS|publisher=Digital Spy UK|accessdate=August 21, 2015|date=May 20, 2013}}</ref> In naming him the second greatest wrestler ever, [[IGN]] described The Undertaker as, \"one of the most respected wrestlers, and characters, in the business; treated with actual reverence.
