He soon recovers and enjoys his hospital stay as respite from the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] trial. Tony recognizes this as a potential advantage and convinces Junior to feign [[dementia]] during his competency hearings. He gives a good performance, but begins exhibiting actual signs of dementia in private.\n\n[[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s 12-year-old son Justin is hit in the chest with an arrow while play-acting ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' with a friend, resulting in significant blood loss and brain damage. Delivering a wad of cash to Tony, Ralphie cries openly. Tony tells him he is now seeing [[Valentina La Paz|Valentina]]; Ralphie smiles and pats his cheek. Expressing a desire for some kind of redemption, he meets with [[Father Phil Intintola|Father Phil]] and establishes a scholarship at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] in [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie Jr.]]'s name. Everyone sympathizes with him except [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]]: his mother recently received a traumatic prank phone call, and he suspects that it was from Ralphie, retaliating against Paulie for [[The Weight (The Sopranos)|ratting him out to Johnny]].   \n\nThere is a fire at the stables, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault. Pie-O-My is badly burned and has to be euthanized. Tony immediately suspects Ralphie, and confronts him at his home over the suspicious timing of the fire: there will be a $200,000 insurance pay-out. Ralphie vehemently denies the accusation, but their argument escalates into a physical fight, leading to Tony killing Ralphie with his bare hands. He calls [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] to help with the clean-up. A doped-up Chris arrives late and helps Tony [[dismemberment|dismember]] Ralphie's body, then dispose of his remains in separate locations. Tony never outright admits to Chris that he murdered Ralphie, and Chris never expresses outright suspicion. After completing the disposal, they clean up at the [[Bada Bing]], where Tony passes out and wakes up alone the following morning.\n\n==Deceased==\n*  Pie-O-My and several other horses: Killed in a stable fire. Cause is deemed accidental by insurance company.\n* [[Ralph Cifaretto]]: beaten and strangled to death by Tony Soprano due to suspicion that he caused the fire that killed Pie-O-My, which Ralph denies. His body is then [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[Decapitation|decapitated]] with the help of Christopher Moltisanti.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Tony uses the phrase \"whoever did this\" when discussing with Christopher who exactly was responsible for Ralphie's death. Earlier, he used the phrase in reference to the guilty party responsible for the prank call to Paulie's mother.\n\n==Connections to prior episodes==\n*When Tony confronts Ralph about the fire, he asks him about Corky Ianucci. Tony believes Ralph hired him to start the stable fire which killed Pie-O-My. Corky was also apparently used by Silvio to help blow up Vesuvio, the restaurant owned by Artie Bucco, in the [[Pilot (The Sopranos)|pilot episode]].\n* When Tony looks in the mirror the morning after killing Ralph, he sees a picture of Tracee, the Bada Bing stripper whom Ralph killed in the episode \"[[University (The Sopranos episode)|University]].\"\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* Carmela is seen wearing a [[Columbia University]] T-shirt when talking to Tony and her son in the kitchen.\n* After Ralph's murder, Tony and Christopher watch ''[[The Last Time I Saw Paris]]'' (1954) on Ralph's television.\n* Father Phil asks Ralphie \"Were you there when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain?\" This is a near-verbatim quotation of a line from the [[Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" (\"I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain\").\n\n==Music==\n* \"[[When I Need You]]\" by [[Leo Sayer]] is playing when Ralph is in the bath.\n*[[The Moonglows]]' original recording of \"[[Sincerely (song)|Sincerely]]\" plays while Carmela and Rosalie dine at Vesuvio.\n* The song played over the end credits is \"The Man with the Harmonica\" by [[Apollo 440]]. It is originally from the [[Ennio Morricone]] score of ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', a [[Sergio Leone]] film. The man with the harmonica was played by [[Charles Bronson]].\n* Though not heard, the song \"[[Sympathy For The Devil]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]] is referenced four times through various dialogue directly alluding to Ralph as the devil.  The references allude to the fact that Ralph in this episode for the first time is portrayed somewhat sympathetically.\n**Ralph to surgeon: \"Please, allow me to introduce myself.\"\n**Ralph to Father Intintola: \"Pleased to meet you.\"\n**Father Intintola to Ralph: \"Were you there, when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain?\" \n**Tony to Paulie: \"Paulie, his kid's in the hospital.

He soon recovers and enjoys his hospital stay as respite from the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] trial. Tony recognizes this as a potential advantage and convinces Junior to feign [[dementia]] during his competency hearings. He gives a good performance, but begins exhibiting actual signs of dementia in private.\n\n[[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s 12-year-old son Justin is hit in the chest with an arrow while play-acting ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' with a friend, resulting in significant blood loss and brain damage. Delivering a wad of cash to Tony, Ralphie cries openly. Tony tells him he is now seeing [[Valentina La Paz|Valentina]]; Ralphie smiles and pats his cheek. Expressing a desire for some kind of redemption, he meets with [[Father Phil Intintola|Father Phil]] and establishes a scholarship at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] in [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie Jr.]]'s name. Everyone sympathizes with him except [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]]: his mother recently received a traumatic prank phone call, and he suspects that it was from Ralphie, retaliating against Paulie for [[The Weight (The Sopranos)|ratting him out to Johnny]].   \n\nThere is a fire at the stables, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault. Pie-O-My is badly burned and has to be euthanized. Tony immediately suspects Ralphie, and confronts him at his home over the suspicious timing of the fire: there will be a $200,000 insurance pay-out. Ralphie vehemently denies the accusation, but their argument escalates into a physical fight, leading to Tony killing Ralphie with his bare hands. He calls [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] to help with the clean-up. A doped-up Chris arrives late and helps Tony [[dismemberment|dismember]] Ralphie's body, then dispose of his remains in separate locations. Tony never outright admits to Chris that he murdered Ralphie, and Chris never expresses outright suspicion. After completing the disposal, they clean up at the [[Bada Bing]], where Tony passes out and wakes up alone the following morning.\n\n==Deceased==\n*  Pie-O-My and several other horses: Killed in a stable fire. Cause is deemed accidental by insurance company.\n* [[Ralph Cifaretto]]: beaten and strangled to death by Tony Soprano due to suspicion that he caused the fire that killed Pie-O-My, which Ralph denies. His body is then [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[Decapitation|decapitated]] with the help of Christopher Moltisanti.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Tony uses the phrase \"whoever did this\" when discussing with Christopher who exactly was responsible for Ralphie's death. Earlier, he used the phrase in reference to the guilty party responsible for the prank call to Paulie's mother.\n\n==Connections to prior episodes==\n*When Tony confronts Ralph about the fire, he asks him about Corky Ianucci. Tony believes Ralph hired him to start the stable fire which killed Pie-O-My. Corky was also apparently used by Silvio to help blow up Vesuvio, the restaurant owned by Artie Bucco, in the [[Pilot (The Sopranos)|pilot episode]].\n* When Tony looks in the mirror the morning after killing Ralph, he sees a picture of Tracee, the Bada Bing stripper whom Ralph killed in the episode \"[[University (The Sopranos episode)|University]].\"\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* Carmela is seen wearing a [[Columbia University]] T-shirt when talking to Tony and her son in the kitchen.\n* After Ralph's murder, Tony and Christopher watch ''[[The Last Time I Saw Paris]]'' (1954) on Ralph's television.\n* Father Phil asks Ralphie \"Were you there when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain?\" This is a near-verbatim quotation of a line from the [[Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" (\"I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain\").\n\n==Music==\n* \"[[When I Need You]]\" by [[Leo Sayer]] is playing when Ralph is in the bath.\n*[[The Moonglows]]' original recording of \"[[Sincerely (song)|Sincerely]]\" plays while Carmela and Rosalie dine at Vesuvio.\n* The song played over the end credits is \"The Man with the Harmonica\" by [[Apollo 440]]. It is originally from the [[Ennio Morricone]] score of ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', a [[Sergio Leone]] film. The man with the harmonica was played by [[Charles Bronson]].\n* Though not heard, the song \"[[Sympathy For The Devil]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]] is referenced four times through various dialogue directly alluding to Ralph as the devil.  The references allude to the fact that Ralph in this episode for the first time is portrayed somewhat sympathetically.\n**Ralph to surgeon: \"Please, allow me to introduce myself.\"\n**Ralph to Father Intintola: \"Pleased to meet you.\"\n**Father Intintola to Ralph: \"Were you there, when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain?\" \n**Tony to Paulie: \"Paulie, his kid's in the hospital.

However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self.

The short was directed by series creator [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] and [[Rob Renzetti]] who also wrote the short.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dexter's Laboratory (TV Series) Deedeemensional/Dial M for Monkey: Magmanamus/Maternal Combat (1996) Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831977/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |website=IMDb |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn \"DeeDeemensional\", Dexter (voiced by [[Christine Cavanaugh]]) is forced to send his sister, Dee Dee (voiced by [[Allison Moore (actress)|Allison Moore]]), back in time to warn past Dexter not to open an interdimensional doorway. However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed. The Dee Dees arrive again at 3:00 to see Dexter righting something and warn him, he then firmly says that they're interrupting his \"...very important calculations.\" as it shows Dexter's papers for the doorway.<ref>{{cite episode |title=DeeDeemensional |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Dexter's Laboratory |series-link= |first=Rob |last=Renzetti |network=TNT |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=english}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIMDb: {{Rating|7.6|10}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dexter's Laboratory Season 1 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115157/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1 |website=IMDb |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> Rating Graph: {{Rating|7.6|10}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dexter's Laboratory rating (TV show, 1996-2003) |url=https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/dexter-s-laboratory-ratings-5382/ |website=Rating Graph |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n", "name_user": "Opirentis", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeeDeemensional_(Dexter%27s_Laboratory)"}
