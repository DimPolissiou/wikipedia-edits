{"title_page": "Culture of Belgium", "text_new": "{{Culture of Belgium}}\n'''Belgian culture''' involves both the aspects shared by all Belgians regardless of the language they speak and the differences between the main cultural communities:  the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and the French-speaking [[Walloons]]. Most Belgians view their culture as an integral part of European culture. However, members of each of the two main linguistic groups generally make their cultural choices from within their own community, and then, when going beyond, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] draw intensively from both the [[English-speaking culture]] (which dominates sciences, professional life and most news media) and the [[Culture of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], whereas French-speakers focus on \ncultural life in [[Culture of France|France]] and elsewhere in the [[Francophone|French-speaking world]], and less outside. Hi my name is nicklebum and I live in Antarctica with my obese toenails.\n\nMinorities, such as the [[Jews]] who have formed a component of [[Flemish culture]] \u2014 in particular that of [[Antwerp]] \u2014 for over five hundred years, have specific cultures.\n\n== Art==\n{{main|Art in Belgium}}\n\n===Comics===\n{{main|Belgian comics}}\n\nBelgium has numerous well-known [[cartoonist]]s, such as [[Herg\u00e9]] (''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''), [[Peyo]] (''[[The Smurfs]]''), [[Andre Franquin|Franquin]] (''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'', ''[[Marsupilami]]'', ''[[Gaston Lagaffe|Gaston]]''), [[Willy Vandersteen]] (''[[Spike and Suzy]]''), [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] (''[[Lucky Luke]]''), [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs|Edgar P. Jacobs]] (''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''), [[Jef Nys]] ([[Jommeke]]) and [[Marc Sleen]] (''[[The Adventures of Nero|Nero]]'').\n\nMore recently, [[Jean Van Hamme]] (''[[XIII (comic)|XIII]]'', ''[[Largo Winch]]'', ''[[Thorgal]]'', etc.), [[Raoul Cauvin]] (''[[Les Tuniques Bleues]]'', ''[[Agent 212]]''), [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] and [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] (''[[Les Cit\u00e9s Obscures]]'') are among the most read cartoonists.\n\nBelgium is home to some of the most important European comics magazines and publishers, with [[Dupuis]] (''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine), [[Le Lombard]] (''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine) and [[Casterman]].\n\n===Museums===\nSome of the most impressive museums in Belgium are [[Royal Museum for Fine Arts, Antwerp|The Royal Museum for Fine Arts]], in [[Antwerp]], which has an admirable collection of works by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], the [[Groeningemuseum]], in [[Bruges]], with the [[Flemish Primitives]], the MAS (Museum Aan De Stroom) which is located on 't eilandje is the biggest museum in Belgium, and the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in Brussels, which has a cinema, a concert hall and artworks of many periods, including a large [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] collection.\n\nFurthermore, the [[Plantin-Moretus Museum]] in Antwerp, a [[world heritage]] site, is the complete factory of the largest publishing house of the 17th century.\n\n==Architecture==\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Belgium\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\nExamples of Belgian architecture include the [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ''Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Gertrude de [[Nivelles]]'' (1046) and ''[[Tournai Cathedral|Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Tournai]]'', the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] 15th-century [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in Antwerp and [[Baroque]] [[Brussels]] [[Grand Place]]. [[Mosan Renaissance]] style is typical of the architecture within the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]].\nFamous [[Art Nouveau]] architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] influenced early 20th-century architecture in Belgium and abroad.\n\n==Literature==\n{{main|Belgian literature}}\n\nBelgian literature was more cohesive in the past but is now divided between a Flemish literature and a Belgian Francophone literature. Until the mid-20th century, Belgian writers more often wrote in French even if they were Flemish, due both to the then-dominant position of that language in worldwide culture and its dominant position within Belgium itself (e.g. [[Suzanne Lilar]], [[Emile Verhaeren]] or [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]), and many French-speaking individuals come from originally Dutch-speaking families (particularly in Brussels, e.g. [[Jacques Brel]]). As the [[Flemish movement]] grew in importance, Dutch-penned authors became more and more prominent in Flanders and even played an important role in the said movement\u2014see for example [[Hendrik Conscience]]. Important contemporary Flemish authors are [[Tom Lanoye]] or [[Dimitri Verhulst]].\n\nBelgian Francophone literature is sometimes difficult to distinguish from French literature as a whole, because several great French authors went to Belgium for refuge (e.g. [[Apollinaire]], [[Baudelaire]], [[Rimbaud]], [[Verlaine]] and recent tax-refugee [[Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt]]) and conversely, top French-speaking writers sometimes settle in Paris (e.g. [[Georges Simenon|Simenon]], [[Am\u00e9lie Nothomb]]). Belgian Francophone literature is characterized by authors who achieved a nationwide success in Belgium while being little known in France, and shares traits that are perceived as typically Belgian: use of black humour, self-derision, surrealism and absurdism (in a similar vein as Belgian painters such as [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]), and references to Belgian history and society (such as Belgian royalty, language conflicts, former colony of Congo, Belgian beers and gastronomy, and whatever is typically Belgian) and they are often active in Belgian medias as columnists or entertainers. Such authors are [[Thomas Gunzig]], [[Juan d'Oultremont]], [[Jacques Mercier]], etc.\n\nThere have also been writers in the [[Walloon language]], such as [[Nicolas Defrecheux]] and [[Edouard Remouchamps]].\n\nMost famous Belgian authors are : [[Guido Gezelle]] (1830\u20131899), [[Emile Verhaeren]] (1855\u20131916), [[Max Elskamp]] (1862\u20131931), [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] (1862\u20131949), [[Paul van Ostaijen]] (1896\u20131926), [[Henri Michaux]] (French born and educated in Belgium, 1899\u20131984) and [[Jacques Brel]] (1929\u20131978) and prose writers: [[Hendrik Conscience]] (1812\u20131883), [[Charles de Coster]] (1827\u20131879), [[Willem Elsschot]] (1882\u20131960), [[Michel De Ghelderode|Michel de Ghelderode]] (1898\u20131962), [[Georges Simenon]] 1903\u20131989, [[Louis Paul Boon]] (1912\u20131979), [[Hugo Claus]] (1929\u20132008), [[Pierre Mertens]] (born in 1939) [[Ernest Claes]] (1885\u20131968),  and, [[Am\u00e9lie Nothomb]] (born in 1967).\n\n==Cinema==\n{{main|Cinema of Belgium}}\nBelgian cinema has already been awarded several times at [[Cannes Film Festival]] and in other less-known festivals.  Belgian movies are generally made with small budget, and are mostly funded by the regional governments (the [[Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds]], and [[Wallimage]], among others)  and private corporations by means of sponsorship and [[product placement]].\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Music of Belgium}}\nMany important classical composers were born in Belgium. One of the most famous is [[C\u00e9sar Franck]] but [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and [[Wim Mertens]] are also noteworthy. Many great Medieval and Renaissance composers, such as [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Heinrich Isaac]] and [[Jacob Obrecht]] came from the area which is now Belgium (see the [[Franco-Flemish School]]).\n\nWell-known singers include [[Lara Fabian]], [[Stromae]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[Arno Hintjens|Arno]], [[Maurane]], [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]], [[Salvatore Adamo]], [[Philippe Lafontaine]] and [[Pierre Rapsat]].\n\n[[Adolphe Sax]], the inventor of the saxophone, was born in Belgium. The country has also a very active [[jazz]] scene that is achieving international recognition with bands like [[Aka Moon]], [[Maak's Spirit]] and [[Octurn]]. Harmonicist [[Toots Thielemans]], guitarist [[Philip Catherine]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] are probably the best known Belgian jazz musicians.\n\n[[Hooverphonic]], formed in the mid-1990s, is a Belgian [[pop music|pop]] / [[trip hop]] band that achieved international recognition through their inclusion on the soundtrack [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s 1996 film ''Io Ballo da Sola'' (English: [[Stealing Beauty]]). Other popular Belgian pop music comes from [[Axelle Red]], [[Vaya Con Dios (band)|Vaya Con Dios]], [[Kate Ryan]] and [[K's Choice]].\n\nBelgium has also influenced electronic music with a.o. [[Front 242]], [[Praga Khan]] (also known as [[Lords of Acid]]) and [[2 Many DJ's]], and rock music with [[Deus (band)|dEUS]] and [[Soulwax]].\n\nBelgian [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] started with the rise of [[Starflam]], [[CNN (crew)|CNN]] (a Brussels-based crew) and [['t Hof van Commerce]] in the mid-1990s.\n\nBelgium is also Home to some very popular music festivals such as: [[Tomorrowland festival|Tomorrowland]], [[Rock Werchter]] or [[Pukkelpop]]\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Cuisine of Belgium}}\n\nGood cooking and fine beers are seen by many as part of Belgian culture. One of the many beers with the high prestige is that of the [[Trappists|Trappist]] [[monk]]s. Technically, it is an [[ale]] and traditionally each abbey's beer is served in its own glass (the forms, heights and widths are different). There are only eleven breweries (six of them are Belgian) that are allowed to brew [[Trappist beer]].\n\nAlthough Belgian gastronomy is connected to French cuisine, some [[recipe]]s were reputedly invented there as e.g. [[French-fried potatoes]] (despite the name), [[Carbonade flamande|stoofkarbonnaden]] (or ''carbonade flamande'' in French, a beef stew with beer, mustard and [[bay laurel]]), [[speculaas]] (a sort of cinnamon and ginger-flavoured cookie), [[Brussels waffle]]s (and their variant, [[Liege waffle]]s), [[waterzooi]] (a broth made with chicken or fish, cream and vegetables), [[endive]] with [[bechamel]] sauce, [[Brussels sprout]]s, Belgian [[praline]]s (Belgium has some of the most renowned [[chocolate]] houses), ''charcuterie'' (deli meats) and ''[[Paling in 't groen]]'' (river [[eel]]s in a sauce of green herbs).\n\nBelgian cookies are noted for their aroma and unique texture.\n\n== Folklore ==\n{{main|Folklore of Belgium}}\nFestivals play a major role in Belgium's cultural life. Nearly every city and town has its own festival, some that date back several centuries. These are not merely aimed at tourism but authentic celebrations that take months to prepare. Two of the biggest festivals are the three-day [[carnival]] at [[Binche]], near [[Mons]], held just before [[Lent]] (the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter), and the Procession of the Holy Blood, held in [[Bruges]] in May. During the carnival in Binche, \"Gilles\", which are men dressed in high, plumed hats and bright costumes, lead the procession.  Several of these festivals include sporting competitions, such as [[cycling]], and many fall under the category of [[Kermesse (festival)|kermesse]].\n\nAn important holiday (which is however not an official public holiday) takes place each year on December 6. This is ''[[Sinterklaas]]'' in Dutch or ''la Saint-Nicolas'' in French (English: ''[[Saint Nicholas]]''). This is sort of an early Christmas. On December 5 evening before going to bed, children put their shoes by the hearth with water or wine and a carrot for Saint Nicholas's horse or [[donkey]].  According to tradition, St. Nicholas comes at night and travels down the chimney. He then takes the food and water or wine, leaves presents, goes back up, feeds his horse or donkey, and continues on his course. He also knows whether children have been good or bad. This holiday is especially loved by children in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dutch immigrants imported the tradition into the [[United States]], where Saint Nicholas is now known as [[Santa Claus]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Belgian literature]]\n* [[List of Belgians]]\n* [[Europalia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.belgium.be Belgium portal in Dutch, English, French, and German]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515060034/http://www.diabolicdigest.net/Belgium/Culture.htm Exploring Belgium's cultural identity]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515080054/http://www.diabolicdigest.net/Belgium/Etiquette.htm Grooming yourself for Belgian society]\n\n{{Belgium topics}}\n{{Culture of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Belgian culture| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Culture of Belgium}}\n'''Belgian culture''' involves both the aspects shared by all Belgians regardless of the language they speak and the differences between the main cultural communities:  the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and the French-speaking [[Walloons]].

Antarctica was also part of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwanaland]], which gradually broke up by [[continental drift]] starting 110 million years ago. The separation of [[South America]] from Antarctica 30-35 million years ago allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still an important component of the flora of southern [[Neotropical]] ([[South America]]) and [[Australasian realm]]s, which were also former parts of Gondwana.\n\nSome botanists recognize an [[Antarctic Floristic Kingdom]] that includes Antarctica, [[New Zealand]], and parts of Temperate South America where the Antarctic Flora is still a major component.\n\n== Ecoregions ==\nFour [[tundra]] [[ecoregions]] are recognized:\n{{Antarctica tundra}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Terauds | first1 = A | last2 = Chown | first2 = SL | last3 = Morgan | first3 = F | last4 = Peat | first4 = HJ | last5 = Watts | first5 = D | display-authors = et al | year = 2012 | title = Conservation biogeography of the Antarctic | url = | journal = Divers Distrib | volume = 18 | issue = 7| pages = 726\u2013741 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00925.x }}\n* [[Life in the Freezer]], a [[BBC]] [[television]] series on life on and around Antarctica\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060208123258/http://www.planetavivo.org/english/ResearchPrograms/Antarctica/SlideShows/ArdleyIsland/ArdleyIsland1.html Biodiversity at Ardley Island, South Shetland archipelago, Antarctica]\n* [http://www.foraminifera.eu/weddell.html Deep Sea Foraminifera] \u2013 Deep Sea Foraminifera from 4400m depth, Weddell Sea - an image gallery of hundreds of specimens and description\n* [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/340017/title/Aliens_in_Antarctica Aliens in Antarctica; Visitors carry unwelcome species into a once pristine environment] May 5, 2012 ''[[Science News]]''\n\n{{Antarctica|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Biomes}}\n\n{{coord|90|00|S|0|00|W|source:kolossus-cawiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Antarctic realm| ]]\n[[Category:Biogeographic realms]]\n[[Category:Biogeography]]\n[[Category:Phytogeography]]\n[[Category:Antarctic region]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "copyedits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_realm"}
