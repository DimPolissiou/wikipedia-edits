The league would also enforce a rule where every Senior A club must field a reserve grade team \"of sufficient calibre to satisfy the management committee\". If they failed to do so they would be vulnerable to being removed from the A grade. The league also reserved the right to set the two lowest teams together at the end of the season against each other in a match and eliminating the losers, or compelling them to improve their standard of play or withdraw from the league.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Clubs a Fifth\n| page = 13\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume= LXII| issue= 55\n| date = 6 March 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310306.2.143\n| accessdate = 17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Eastern Suburbs Tour of New Zealand ===\nIn mid October the Eastern Suburbs club team from Sydney toured New Zealand.

Mr. Samuel Harris of the [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team collapsed and died from heart failure a few minutes from time in the final.

There was a match played between North Island and South Island, but the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team's only match was for the Northern Union Cup against [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]]. In a surprise result Northland had defeated [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] to lift the trophy.

There was a match played between North Island and South Island, but the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team's only match was for the Northern Union Cup against [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]]. In a surprise result Northland had defeated [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] to lift the trophy. [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] challenged for it but could only manage a 19 all draw and so Northland retained it. Auckland junior teams played two matches and a colts side played against the touring [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] team from [[Sydney]] who were the premiers of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]].\n\n=== Representative fixtures ===\nOnly a small number of fixtures were played in the 1931 season partly owing to the fact that [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] did not hold the Northern Union Cup. Also the touring [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] team from Sydney had matches with club sides organised for them.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1931 Auckland Representative Fixtures\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Representative Fixture\n| 15 Aug<ref>{{cite news\n| title =High Scoring Game/North Island League Team/Too Superior for South/Margin of Twenty-Nine Points\n| page = 11\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20953\n| date = 17 August 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310817.2.130\n| accessdate = 26 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| North Island || 52 || South Island || 23 || Carlaw Park # 1, 3pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Northern Union Cup\n| 26 Sep<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Fixture/Auckland and Northland/Match Ends in a Draw\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20989\n| date = 28 September 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310928.2.131.5\n| accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| Auckland || 19 || Northland || 19 || Carlaw Park # 1, 3:15pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Representative Match\n| 17 Oct<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Wednesday Reps V Junior Reps\n| page =9\n| work =New Zealand Herald| volume= LXVIII| issue= 21007\n| date = 19 October 1931\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19311019.2.136\n| accessdate = 28 September 2019}}</ref>\n|| Wednesday Representatives|| 23 || Auckland Junior Representatives || 6 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n== Annual general meetings and club news ==\n*[[Auckland Rugby League]] held their annual general meeting in the Chamber of Commerce, Swanson Street on Thursday 16 April.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football\n| page = 18\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=82\n| date = 8 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310408.2.172.3\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref> At a later meeting they voted to adopt the motion whereby its grading of referees and appointments of them for matches would be done by a group of three, consisting of two of its members and a representative of the [[Auckland Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Appointment of Referees/Management Representation Approved\n| page = 12\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=98\n| date = 28 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310428.2.125\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref> Tenders were requested for the lease of the Carlaw Park Refreshment Stall, and for the rights of the Rugby League Gazette.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Rugby Football League\n| page = 20\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=87\n| date = 14 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310414.2.188.3\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n*[[Auckland Rugby League]] Junior Management Committee held their annual meeting at the Grey Buildings on Tuesday, 31 March.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football\n| page = 8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume= LXVIII |issue= 20834\n| date = 28 March 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310328.2.10.4\n| accessdate = 18 October 2019}}</ref> After the reports were given by club delegates the prospect was for a record season in terms of team and player numbers.

These features guarantee high reliability and safety, even under the most extreme environmental conditions.\n\nThe KBA offers a wide range of firing modes: single shot; programmable rapid single shot with a rate of fire of up to 200 rds/min; and full automatic fire of 600 rds/ min. The cannon functions, such as cocking and firing, are electrically actuated by remote control unit or in auxiliary mode mechanically by a hand crank and a trigger pedal.\n\nThe Oerlikon KBA 25mm cannon has been designed for integration in various types of mounts, small size and low weight offer various integration possibilities such as: \n* Manned (1 or 2 operators) or remote controlled turrets on IFVs, APCs\n* Air defence gun mounts\n* Naval mounts\n* Helicopter mounts\n\nThe various types of available ammunition combined with the unique Instant Ammunition Selection Device (IASD) and different selectable firing modes with a rate of fire up to 600rds/min support any type of operational use.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1964 the American company [[TRW Inc.]] was entrusted with the development of a 25&nbsp;mm weapon while Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works assumed responsibility for developing the ammunition and interior ballistics for it.\n\nBoth were intended to meet the requirements for the armament of [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s of the 80's and 90's: \n* Ammunition performance: 25&nbsp;mm armour steel, 60\u00b0 (NATO) angle of impact, 1000m range, corresponding to the armour of a well-armoured infantry fighting vehicle.\n* \"Instant ammunition selection\" for engagement of different targets\n* Selectable firing mode: Accurate single shot, bursts with a rate of fire of more than 550 rds/min for engagement of aircraft\n* Compact structure: with low weight for installation in gun turrets of APC's\n* Simple to operate: and service in the hands of infantry\n\n[[File:KBA Draw.png|left|thumb|284x284px|Oerlikon KBA 25mm Part Description]]\nThree years later, at the beginning of 1967, technical tests and firing trials were carried out with the first two American prototype (recoil operated) cannons (TRW-6425)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bevfitchett.us/machine-gun-v5/mm-trw-automatic-cannon.html|title=Mm Trw Automatic Cannon - Machine Gun V5|website=www.bevfitchett.us|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> at Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works followed by the first demonstrations for another NATO country.\n\nIn the trials, however, the American prototypes displayed a number of basic functional deficiencies.

(1970, 10 gas-operated cannons). When the first prototype cannons became available, suitable gun turrets had also to be provided. In 1967 an agreement was signed between Machine Tool Works Oerlikon-Buehrle and a well-known and established sub-contractor, to collaborate in the development and manufacture of 25&nbsp;mm gun turrets. These gun turrets were in the first instance to be suitable for mounting on [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]] C&R of a NATO country's army. \nThe complete system, cannon, hand-driven turret and ammunition underwent detailed firing trials between 1969 and 1971. Special new development efforts were devoted to improve functional reliability, durability and firing precision, and in 1971 sufficient progress had been made for the weapon system to fulfil the strict specifications laid down, and to be delivered to the Netherlands.\n\nWithin the framework of the product support service Oerlikon improves the product and adapts it regularly to the latest requirements. An important step forward was made in 1982/83 when the ammunition penetration performance range of the 25&nbsp;mm APDS-T (sub-caliber) round was increased 150% from 1000 to 2500 m.\n\nThe wide range of strong points of the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon, such as high rate of fire, ammunition performance, good safety record, dual belt feeder with first-round response, no external power requirement and simple maintenance lead to a considerably increasing interest in the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon in years.\n\n== Ammunition ==\nA wide range of ammunition has been developed for this weapon specifically developed to engage and defeat both ground and air targets.\n\nThe ammunition complies with all handling and operational safety requirements according to MIL-STD\u2019s, and was subjected to intensive trials by NATO member countries prior to its introduction and standardization as NATO 25mmx137 ammunition.\n[[File:US Navy 090129-N-4774B-008 Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Nicholas Brassard

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]].

A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}</ref>\n\n==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====\n{{main|Treatise on Law}}\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law]].

There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.\n\nAquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].\n\n=== Islamic Political Evolution ===\n\n==== Mutazilite vs. Asharite ====\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 375\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Al-Farabi.jpg\n | width1            = 1800\n | height1           = 1950\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Al Farabi]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Avicenna Portrait on Silver Vase - Museum at BuAli Sina (Avicenna) Mausoleum - Hamadan - Western Iran (7423560860).jpg\n | width2            = 485\n | height2           = 550\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Ibn Sina]]\n}}\n\nThe rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]\u2014in effect ''all'' philosophy was \"[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]\" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the \"rationalist\" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the \"traditionalist\" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla/page/153 153]|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}</ref>\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 375\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Statue of Averroes (C\u00f3rdoba) - BAE09705.jpg\n | width1            = 1800\n | height1           = 2000\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Ibn Rushd]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Ibn khaldoun-kassus.jpg\n | width2            = 500\n | height2           = 450\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Ibn Khaldun]]\n}}\n[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]\u2014i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad\u2014thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|\u0130bn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the \"core\" terms of the Qur'an\u2014i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)\u2014is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occur because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b {{!}} Muslim philosopher|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOther notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the \"Book of Government\" in English.

Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.<ref>{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}</ref>\n\n=== European Renaissance ===\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.\n\n==== Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli ====\n\nOne of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511\u201312 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of [[classical antiquity]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end\u2014i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.<ref>{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310\u201312|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}</ref>\n\n=== European Enlightenment ===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories emerged about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]]. These new theories led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].\n\nThese theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \"state\" and \"government.\" It was decided that \"state\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206\u201307|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}</ref>\n\nPolitical and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. Free trade, as apposed to these religious theories, is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment.\n\nHistorians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as \"propagandistic\".Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church Fathers. In a letter to Frederick II, King of Prussia, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity: La n\u00f4tre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infect\u00e9 le monde.\n\"Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ...

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I.[19] Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin, it was Persianised in terms of language, culture, literature and habits.\n\nAs well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], Delaware, [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.The Iroquois (/\u02c8\u026ar\u0259kw\u0254\u026a/ or /\u02c8\u026ar\u0259kw\u0251\u02d0/) or Haudenosaunee are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy in North America. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy, and to the English as the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca. After 1722, they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy, as they were also Iroquoian-speaking, and became known as the Six Nations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/nativeamericanpo0000joha|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/nativeamericanpo0000joha/page/69 69]|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}</ref>\n\n==== John Locke ====\n\n[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.\n\n==== John Stuart Mill ====\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]]'s work on political philosophy begins in ''On Liberty, On Liberty'' is the most influential statement of his liberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new threats to liberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional societies in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an aristocracy). Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own interests, rather than the interests of the governed. Mill's explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of Utilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty, which is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong actions as actions that it is useful to sanction. Mill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice involves duties that are perfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are correlated with rights.\nJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a matter of right. These perfect duties will thus create liberty and collective freedom within a state.\nHe uses, ''On Liberty'' to discuss gender equality in a society. To Mill, Utilitarianism was the perfect tool to justify gender equality in The Subjection of Women, referring to the political, lawful and social subjection of women. When a woman was married, she entered a legally binding coverture with her husband; once she married her legal existence as an individual was suspended under \u201cmarital unity\u201d . While it is easy to presume that a woman would not marry under these circumstances, being unmarried had social consequences. A woman could only advance in social stature and wealth if she had a rich husband to do the groundwork. Mill uses his Utilitarian ethics to assess how gender equality would be the best way to achieve \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d :\n\u201cThe principle that regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes \u2026 and is now one of the chief obstacles to human improvement\u2026\u201d \n\nThe \u2018chief obstacle\u2019 to Mill relates to women's intellectual capability. The Subjection of Women looks at this in the women of society and argues that diminishing their intellectual potential wastes the knowledge and skill of half of the population; such knowledge lost could formulate ideas which could maximise pleasure for society.\n\n==== Benjamin Constant ====\n\n''Main article: [[The Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns]]''\n\nOne of the first thinkers to go by the name of \"liberal\", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society. He drew a distinction between the \"Liberty of the Ancients\" and the \"Liberty of the Moderns\". The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly. In order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.\n\nThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.\n\nMoreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon's martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organised on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations.\n\n==== Thomas Hobbes ====\n\nThe main practical conclusion of Hobbes' political theory is that state or society can not be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent.\n\nIn Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.[citation needed] Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\n\nBeginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\".\n\n==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====\n\n''The Social Contract'' outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanism. Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition. It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article \u00c9conomie Politique (Discourse on Political Economy), featured in Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die. The treatise begins with the dramatic opening lines, \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.\"\n\nRousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom.\n\n=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===\nThe [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism\u2014developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]\u2014was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history\u2014Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was \"standing on its head\", \"the right side up again\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1\u20134|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}</ref> By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]\u2014and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)\u2014on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary ==\nFrom the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in China and [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Britain and the United States\u2014including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]\u2014encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.\n\n[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.\n\nIn Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.<ref>David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers\u2014still largely influenced by Marxism\u2014put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a \"return to [[Hegel]]\". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.\n\nAnother debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective. These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].\n\nA prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in Germany, but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).</ref>\n\nA pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely \"liberty as non-domination.\" Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as \"non-interference,\" \"non-domination\" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.\n\nAnother important strand of contemporary political theory in North America draws on thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]], among others, to develop critiques and articulate alternatives to the sufficiency of the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Communitarianism|communitarian]] debate and [[republicanism]] discourse. Since the 1990s, these political theorists, broadly engaging the \"[[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical approach]]\", \"[[deconstruction]]\", and [[Weak ontology (political concept)|\"weak ontology]]\", have expanded the scope of political theory and issued a variety of arguments on topics such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[agonism]], [[Performativity|gender performativity]], secularism<ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Critique Secular?|last=Asad|first=Talal|last2=Brown|first2=Wendy|last3=Butler|first3=Judith|last4=Mahmood|first4=Saba|date=2013-05-09|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=9780823251681|doi = 10.5422/fordham/9780823251681.001.0001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Why I am not a secularist|last=Connolly, William E.|date=2010|publisher=Minnesota University Press|isbn=9780816633326|oclc=796203705}}</ref>, and more recently the Anthropocene<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facing the planetary.

Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.\n* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason\u2014manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues\u2014gives way to the assembly of righteous government.\n* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).\n* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].\n* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].\n* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.\n* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of [[Conservatism|conservative]]  thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.\n* [[Noam Chomsky]]: He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. Chomsky is a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, and aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chomsky.info/1994____/|title=On Linguistics and Politics, by Noam Chomsky}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourpolitics.net/noam-chomsky-philosophy-anarco-syndicalism-and-truth-to-power/|title=Noam Chomsky: Philosophy, Anarco-Syndicalism, and Truth to Power|date=2018-03-20}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/|title=Noam Chomsky: Neoliberalism is Destroying Our Democracy|journal=The Nation|date=2017-06-02|last1=Lydon|first1=Christopher}}</ref>\n* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.\n* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].\n* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.\n* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.\n* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison\u2013industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.\n* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes they rule over.\n* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].\n* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]\u2014a mainstay of socialism\u2014would lead to a \"total\" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.\n* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the \"cunning\" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].\n* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.\n* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Hume also coined the 'is/ought' problem i.e. the idea that just because something is does not mean that is how it ought to be. This was very influential on normative politics<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1959). Hume on \"Is\" and \"Ought\". The Philosophical Review, 68(4), 451\u2013468. doi:10.2307/2182491</ref>\n* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].\n* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.\n* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].\n* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]: First systematic analysis of how politics necessitates expedient and evil actions. Gave an account of statecraft in a realistic point of view instead of relying on idealism. Machiavelli also relays recommendations on how to run a well ordered [[Republicanism|republican]] state, as he viewed them to be better forms of government than autocracies.\n* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be \"Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]\" and \"Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]\" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].\n* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of \"[[repressive desublimation]]\", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.\n* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.\n* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.\n* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.\n* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a \"balance of powers\" in the divisions of a state.\n* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].\n* [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]: Known for the socio-economic and political theory [[Progressive Utilization Theory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://proutglobe.org/|title=PROUT Globe|website=proutglobe.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].\n* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.\n* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].\n* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.\n* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].\n* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].\n* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.\n* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.\n* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].\n* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].\n* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior (\"the invisible hand\") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.\n* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.\n* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason.

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]].

A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}</ref>\n\n==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====\n{{main|Treatise on Law}}\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law]].

This view was challenged by the \"rationalist\" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the \"traditionalist\" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla/page/153 153]|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}</ref>\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 375\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Statue of Averroes (C\u00f3rdoba) - BAE09705.jpg\n | width1            = 1800\n | height1           = 2000\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Ibn Rushd]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Ibn khaldoun-kassus.jpg\n | width2            = 500\n | height2           = 450\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Ibn Khaldun]]\n}}\n[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]\u2014i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad\u2014thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|\u0130bn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the \"core\" terms of the Qur'an\u2014i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)\u2014is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occur because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b {{!}} Muslim philosopher|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOther notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the \"Book of Government\" in English.

Others, like [[Nicole Oresme]] in his ''[[Livre de Politiques]]'', categorically denied this right to overthrow an unjust ruler.\n\nThe [[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice's sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.<ref>{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}</ref>\n\n=== European Renaissance ===\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.\n\n==== Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli ====\n\nOne of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511\u201312 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of [[classical antiquity]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end\u2014i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.<ref>{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310\u201312|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}</ref>\n\n=== European Enlightenment ===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories emerged about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]]. These new theories led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].\n\nThese theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \"state\" and \"government.\" It was decided that \"state\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206\u201307|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}</ref>\n\nPolitical and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. Free trade, as apposed to these religious theories, is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment.\n\nHistorians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as \"propagandistic\".Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church Fathers. In a letter to Frederick II, King of Prussia, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity: La n\u00f4tre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infect\u00e9 le monde.\n\"Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out.\"[ After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1\u20132|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire or simply Turkey, was a state and caliphate that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia and North Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I.[19] Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin, it was Persianised in terms of language, culture, literature and habits.\n\nAs well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], Delaware, [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.The Iroquois (/\u02c8\u026ar\u0259kw\u0254\u026a/ or /\u02c8\u026ar\u0259kw\u0251\u02d0/) or Haudenosaunee are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy in North America. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy, and to the English as the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca. After 1722, they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy, as they were also Iroquoian-speaking, and became known as the Six Nations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/nativeamericanpo0000joha|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/nativeamericanpo0000joha/page/69 69]|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}</ref>\n\n==== John Locke ====\n\n[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.\n\n==== John Stuart Mill ====\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]]'s work on political philosophy begins in ''On Liberty, On Liberty'' is the most influential statement of his liberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new threats to liberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional societies in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an aristocracy). Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own interests, rather than the interests of the governed. Mill's explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of Utilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty, which is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong actions as actions that it is useful to sanction. Mill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice involves duties that are perfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are correlated with rights.\nJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a matter of right. These perfect duties will thus create liberty and collective freedom within a state.\nHe uses, ''On Liberty'' to discuss gender equality in a society. To Mill, Utilitarianism was the perfect tool to justify gender equality in The Subjection of Women, referring to the political, lawful and social subjection of women. When a woman was married, she entered a legally binding coverture with her husband; once she married her legal existence as an individual was suspended under \u201cmarital unity\u201d . While it is easy to presume that a woman would not marry under these circumstances, being unmarried had social consequences. A woman could only advance in social stature and wealth if she had a rich husband to do the groundwork. Mill uses his Utilitarian ethics to assess how gender equality would be the best way to achieve \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d :\n\u201cThe principle that regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes \u2026 and is now one of the chief obstacles to human improvement\u2026\u201d \n\nThe \u2018chief obstacle\u2019 to Mill relates to women's intellectual capability. The Subjection of Women looks at this in the women of society and argues that diminishing their intellectual potential wastes the knowledge and skill of half of the population; such knowledge lost could formulate ideas which could maximise pleasure for society.\n\n==== Benjamin Constant ====\n\n''Main article: [[The Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns]]''\n\nOne of the first thinkers to go by the name of \"liberal\", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society. He drew a distinction between the \"Liberty of the Ancients\" and the \"Liberty of the Moderns\". The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly. In order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.\n\nThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.\n\nMoreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon's martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organised on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations.\n\n==== Thomas Hobbes ====\n\nThe main practical conclusion of Hobbes' political theory is that state or society can not be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent.\n\nIn Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.[citation needed] Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\n\nBeginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\".\n\n==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====\n\n''The Social Contract'' outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanism. Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition. It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article \u00c9conomie Politique (Discourse on Political Economy), featured in Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die. The treatise begins with the dramatic opening lines, \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.\"\n\nRousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom.\n\n=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===\nThe [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism\u2014developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]\u2014was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history\u2014Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was \"standing on its head\", \"the right side up again\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1\u20134|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}</ref> By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]\u2014and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)\u2014on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary ==\nFrom the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in China and [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Britain and the United States\u2014including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]\u2014encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.\n\n[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.\n\nIn Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.<ref>David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers\u2014still largely influenced by Marxism\u2014put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a \"return to [[Hegel]]\". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.\n\nAnother debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective. These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].\n\nA prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in Germany, but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).</ref>\n\nA pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely \"liberty as non-domination.\" Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as \"non-interference,\" \"non-domination\" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.\n\nAnother important strand of contemporary political theory in North America draws on thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]], among others, to develop critiques and articulate alternatives to the sufficiency of the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Communitarianism|communitarian]] debate and [[republicanism]] discourse. Since the 1990s, these political theorists, broadly engaging the \"[[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical approach]]\", \"[[deconstruction]]\", and [[Weak ontology (political concept)|\"weak ontology]]\", have expanded the scope of political theory and issued a variety of arguments on topics such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[agonism]], [[Performativity|gender performativity]], secularism<ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Critique Secular?|last=Asad|first=Talal|last2=Brown|first2=Wendy|last3=Butler|first3=Judith|last4=Mahmood|first4=Saba|date=2013-05-09|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=9780823251681|doi = 10.5422/fordham/9780823251681.001.0001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Why I am not a secularist|last=Connolly, William E.|date=2010|publisher=Minnesota University Press|isbn=9780816633326|oclc=796203705}}</ref>, and more recently the Anthropocene<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facing the planetary.

Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.\n* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason\u2014manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues\u2014gives way to the assembly of righteous government.\n* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).\n* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].\n* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].\n* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.\n* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of [[Conservatism|conservative]]  thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.\n* [[Noam Chomsky]]: He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. Chomsky is a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, and aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chomsky.info/1994____/|title=On Linguistics and Politics, by Noam Chomsky}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourpolitics.net/noam-chomsky-philosophy-anarco-syndicalism-and-truth-to-power/|title=Noam Chomsky: Philosophy, Anarco-Syndicalism, and Truth to Power|date=2018-03-20}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/|title=Noam Chomsky: Neoliberalism is Destroying Our Democracy|journal=The Nation|date=2017-06-02|last1=Lydon|first1=Christopher}}</ref>\n* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.\n* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].\n* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.\n* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.\n* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison\u2013industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.\n* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes they rule over.\n* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].\n* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]\u2014a mainstay of socialism\u2014would lead to a \"total\" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.\n* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the \"cunning\" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].\n* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.\n* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Hume also coined the 'is/ought' problem i.e. the idea that just because something is does not mean that is how it ought to be. This was very influential on normative politics<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1959). Hume on \"Is\" and \"Ought\". The Philosophical Review, 68(4), 451\u2013468. doi:10.2307/2182491</ref>\n* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].\n* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.\n* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].\n* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]: First systematic analysis of how politics necessitates expedient and evil actions. Gave an account of statecraft in a realistic point of view instead of relying on idealism. Machiavelli also relays recommendations on how to run a well ordered [[Republicanism|republican]] state, as he viewed them to be better forms of government than autocracies.\n* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be \"Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]\" and \"Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]\" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].\n* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of \"[[repressive desublimation]]\", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.\n* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.\n* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.\n* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.\n* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a \"balance of powers\" in the divisions of a state.\n* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].\n* [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]: Known for the socio-economic and political theory [[Progressive Utilization Theory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://proutglobe.org/|title=PROUT Globe|website=proutglobe.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].\n* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.\n* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].\n* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.\n* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].\n* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].\n* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.\n* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.\n* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].\n* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].\n* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior (\"the invisible hand\") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.\n* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.\n* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.\n* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]]. He was also the founder of ethical egoism which endorses anarchy.<ref>Hospers, John (1973). Rule-Egoism. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 54 (4):391.</ref>\n* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[neoconservatism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].\n* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].\n* [[Voltaire|Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.\n* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen\u2014along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]\u2014as a key foundational work on political realism.\n* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Consensus decision-making]]\n* [[Consequentialist justifications of the state]]\n* [[Critical theory]]\n* [[Engaged theory]]\n* [[Justification for the state]]\n* [[Majoritarianism]]\n* [[Panarchy]]\n* [[Political journalism]]\n* [[Political spectrum]]\n* [[Political Theory (journal)|''Political Theory'']]\n* [[Post-structuralism]]\n* [[Progressivism]]\n* [[Rechtsstaat]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n* [[Semiotics of culture]]\n* [[Theodemocracy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Academic journals dedicated to political philosophy include: ''Political Theory'', ''[[Philosophy and Public Affairs]]'', ''[[Contemporary Political Theory]]'', ''Theory & Event'', ''[[Constellations (journal)|Constellations]]'', and ''Journal of Political Philosophy''\n* {{cite book|last=Assiter|first=Alison|authorlink= Alison Assiter|title=Kierkegaard, metaphysics and political theory unfinished selves|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London New York|year=2009|isbn=9780826498311}}\n* {{cite book|author=James F.
