In a secret supplementary protocol, it was agreed (among other points) that the northern part of Bukovina would be annexed by the Soviet Union under a territorial re-organization in [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Eastern Europe]], with the German sub-populations therein undergoing compulsory resettlement to other future Nazi-occupied territories. Under this accord, the Soviet Union occupied northern Romania in 1940. \n\nConsequently, the Third Reich resettled nearly the entire German population of Bukovina (about 96,000 ethnic Germans) to, most notably, Nazi-occupied [[Poland]], where the incoming evacuees were frequently compensated with expropriated farms. From 1941 to 1944, Bukovina was entirely Romanian. Additionally, most of the Jewish population ({{circa}} 30% of the regional population as a whole) were murdered by the Third Reich in collaboration with fascist Romania under Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] during the [[Holocaust]].\n\n=== Resettlement in the wake of World War II ===\n\nIn 1944\u201345, as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] moved closer, the Bukovina Germans settled in Polish areas (like the remaining German population), fled westward or wherever they could manage. Some remained in East Germany; others went to Austria. In 1945, the 7,500 or so remaining Germans in Bukovina were evacuated to Germany, ending (except for a very feeble number of individuals) a significant German presence in Bukovina, Romania after 1940. During the postwar era, the Bukovina Germans, as other 'homeland refugees', assimilated into the Federal Republic, Austria, or the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02619288.1984.9974569 | volume=3 | title=The Second World War resettlement of the Bukovina\u2010Germans | year=1984 | journal=Immigrants | pages=49\u201368 | author=Welisch Sophie}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Romanian 1930 census recorded {{circa}} 75,000 ethnic Germans in Bukovina.<ref>Hannelore Baier, Martin Bottesch, u. a.: Geschichte und Traditionen der deutschen Minderheit in Rum\u00e4nien (Lehrbuch f\u00fcr die 6. und 7.

In 1910\u20131911, the Bukovinan Reconciliation (a political agreement between the peoples of Bukovina and their political representatives in the [[Landtag]] assembly on the question of autonomous regional administration) took place between the representatives of the nationalities.\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Chernivtsi - \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456 1.jpg|[[Chernivtsi|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]] ({{lang-de|Czernowitz}}) town hall, {{circa}} 1905\nFile:Palatul Administrativ din Suceava19.jpg|[[Suceava]] ({{lang-de|Suczawa}}) town hall (nowadays administrative palace), early 20th century\nFile:Biserica romano-catolica din Gura Humorului11.jpg|Roman Catholic church in [[Gura Humorului]] ({{lang-de|Gura Humora}}), early 20th century\nFile:Jakobeny (BildID 15716697).jpg|View of [[Iacobeni, Suceava|Iacobeni]] ({{lang-de|Jakobeny}}), a Zipser German village, early 20th century\nFile:Vatra Dornei 1.jpg|Bilingual German-Romanian postcard from [[Vatra Dornei]] ({{lang-de|Dorna-Watra}}), early 20th century\nFile:Biserica Adormirea Maicii Domnului din Ilisesti.jpg|Former Evangelical Lutheran (now Orthodox) church in [[Ili\u0219e\u0219ti]] ({{lang-de|llischestie}})\n</gallery>\n\n=== Early 20th century and Kingdom of Romania ===\n\n[[File:Deutsche_Siedlungsgebiete_in_Osteuropa_1925.jpg|thumb|right|Map of German minorities in Eastern Europe during the interwar period, also highlighting German settlements in the Kingdom of Romania, including Bukovina.]]\n\nFrom 1918 to 1919, following the end of [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bukovina became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]].

Beginning in 1938 however, due to the poor economic situation and the powerful [[Nazi propaganda|national socialist propaganda]], a pro Third Reich mentality developed within the Bukovina German community. Because of this, many increased their preparedness for evacuation.\n\n=== Outbreak of World War II ===\n\n{{Main|Heim ins Reich}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0693, Graz, Bahnhof, Volksdeutsche Umsiedler.jpg|thumb|Bukovina and [[Bessarabia Germans]] arriving in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], in November, 1940, on their way of resettlement to Nazi-occupied Poland.]]\n\nWhen Nazi Germany signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 (just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]), the fate (unknown to those affected) of the Germans in Bukovina was sealed. In a secret supplementary protocol, it was agreed (among other points) that the northern part of Bukovina would be annexed by the Soviet Union under a territorial re-organization in [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Eastern Europe]], with the German sub-populations therein undergoing compulsory resettlement to other future Nazi-occupied territories. Under this accord, the Soviet Union occupied northern Romania in 1940. \n\nConsequently, the Third Reich resettled nearly the entire German population of Bukovina (about 96,000 ethnic Germans) to, most notably, Nazi-occupied [[Poland]], where the incoming evacuees were frequently compensated with expropriated farms. From 1941 to 1944, Bukovina was entirely Romanian. Additionally, most of the Jewish population ({{circa}} 30% of the regional population as a whole) were murdered by the Third Reich in collaboration with fascist Romania under Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] during the [[Holocaust]].\n\n=== Resettlement in the wake of World War II ===\n\nIn 1944\u201345, as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] moved closer, the Bukovina Germans settled in Polish areas (like the remaining German population), fled westward or wherever they could manage. Some remained in East Germany; others went to Austria. In 1945, the 7,500 or so remaining Germans in Bukovina were evacuated to Germany, ending (except for a very feeble number of individuals) a significant German presence in Bukovina, Romania after 1940. During the postwar era, the Bukovina Germans, as other 'homeland refugees', assimilated into the Federal Republic, Austria, or the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02619288.1984.9974569 | volume=3 | title=The Second World War resettlement of the Bukovina\u2010Germans | year=1984 | journal=Immigrants | pages=49\u201368 | author=Welisch Sophie}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Romanian 1930 census recorded {{circa}} 75,000 ethnic Germans in Bukovina.<ref>Hannelore Baier, Martin Bottesch, u. a.: Geschichte und Traditionen der deutschen Minderheit in Rum\u00e4nien (Lehrbuch f\u00fcr die 6. und 7.

(Since the 18th century, the term \"novella\", or \"novelle\" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long [[short story]] or a short novel.)\n\n[[Murasaki Shikibu|Murasaki Shikibu's]] ''[[Tale of Genji]]'', an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel, but there is considerable debate over this \u2014 there were certainly long fictional works much earlier. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European [[novelist]] of the [[modern era]].<ref name=\"Merriam-Webster 1995\">''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''.  Kathleen Kuiper, ed. 1995. Merriam-Webster, Springfield, Mass.</ref> [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.\n\n==Defining the genre==\n[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]] spending her afternoon with a book ([[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], 1756)]]\nA novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.\n\n* A fictional narrative\n[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.\n* Literary prose\nWhile prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 \u2013 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').<ref>Doody (1996), pp.&nbsp;18\u20133, 187.</ref> Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.<ref>Doody (1996), p.&nbsp;187.</ref>\n* Content: intimate experience\nBoth in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, \"conduct\", and \"gallantry\" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.\n* Length\nThe novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible. The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the \"totality of life.\"<ref>[[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] ''The Theory of the Novel.

Other non-European works, such as the [[Torah]], the [[Quran]], and the [[Bible]], are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel.

They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is \"the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism.\"<ref>\"Chivalric romance\", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).</ref> In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].\n\nOriginally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.\n\nThe shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.<ref>See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.</ref>\n\nPopular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of the medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word \"medieval\" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0-521-47735-2}}</ref>\n\nAround 1800, the connotations of \"romance\" were modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].\n\n===The novella===\n{{Main|Novella}}\n\nThe term \"novel\" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386\u20131400). The ''Decameron'' was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people\u2014seven women and three men\u2014fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.\n\n==Renaissance period: 1500\u20131700==\n[[File:1474 Melusine Ausgabe Augsburg Johann B\u00e4mler Blatt 2.png|thumb|1474: The customer in the copyist's shop with a book he wants to have copied.

Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]\u2014''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by Garc\u00eda Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.\n\n===Chapbooks===\n{{Main|Chapbook}}\nA chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].<ref name=mit.edu>{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century.

The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi\u2013volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.<ref name=\"mit.edu\"/>\n\n===Heroic romances===\n{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}\nHeroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.\n\nThe beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astr\u00e9e]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568\u20131625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of \" panache\", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603\u20131674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.\n\n===Satirical romances===\n[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]\nStories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666\u20131668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.\n\nA second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532\u20131564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.\n\nOther important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651\u201357), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715\u20131735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).<ref>Compare also: G\u00fcnter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser.

All books were sold under the rubric of \"History and politicks\" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.\n\nThat fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were \"lies\" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.\n\nThe romance format of the quasi\u2013historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[C\u00e9sar Vichard de Saint-R\u00e9al]],<ref>See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-R\u00e9al, romancier de l'histoire: une coh\u00e9rence esth\u00e9thique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).</ref> [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],<ref>Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman \u00e0 la fin du Grand Si\u00e8cle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).</ref> and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.\n\nPrefaces and title pages of seventeenth and early eighteenth century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman \u00e0 clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a \"romance\" nor a \"novel\". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.<ref>[[Daniel Defoe]], [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: [[William Taylor (bookseller)|William Taylor]], 1719)</ref>\n\n===Cervantes and the modern novel===\n{{See also|Picaresque novel}}\n\nThe rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.<ref>See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. \"Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining\" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre.

In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.\n\nInfluenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of eighteenth century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality [\u2026] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\").

The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].<ref>''The Works of T.

Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.<ref>August Bohse's (alias Talander) \"Preface\" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).</ref>\n\nThe English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720\u201322), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon|F\u00e9nelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.\n\n==19th century novels==\n\n===Romanticism===\n{{main|Romanticism}}\n{{See also|Newgate novel}}\n[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]\nThe very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).\n\nThe new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],<ref>See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).</ref> and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].<ref>See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).</ref>\n\nThe authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.\n\nThe romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journ\u00e9es de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].\n\nThe [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented \"the true historical novel\".<ref name=\"The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885\">''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed.

In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.\n\nAs the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.\n\nAlong with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.<ref>See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David & Charles, 1978), p.&nbsp;205.</ref><ref>Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852\u20132002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).</ref> Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.\n\n==The 20th century and later==\n{{See also|Modernism|Postmodernism|Antinovel|Nouveau roman}}\n\n===Modernism and post-modernism===\n[[File:Evstafiev-solzhenitsyn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], Vladivostok, 1995]]\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a \"[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\".

Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n\nPopular literature holds a larger market share.

Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.<ref>John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700\u20131739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).</ref> The twentieth century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and [[hedonistic]] belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its nineteenth century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early nineteenth century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.\n\nThe authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.<ref>Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}</ref> And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.\n[[File:J. K. Rowling 2010.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[J. K. Rowling]], 2010]]\nCrime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985\u20131986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.\n\n[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].\n\n[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Chain novel]]\n* [[Children's literature]]\n* [[Gay literature]]\n* [[Nautical fiction]]\n* [[Novel in Scotland]]\n* [[Proletarian novel]]{{col-break|gap=5em}}\n* [[Psychological novel]]\n* [[Sociology of literature]]\n* [[Social novel]]\n* [[War novel]]\n* [[Web fiction]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Theories of the novel'''\n* [[Bakhtin]], Mikhail.

Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]].

The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.\n\n* A fictional narrative\n[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.\n* Literary prose\nWhile prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 \u2013 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').<ref>Doody (1996), pp.&nbsp;18\u20133, 187.</ref> Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.<ref>Doody (1996), p.&nbsp;187.</ref>\n* Content: intimate experience\nBoth in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, \"conduct\", and \"gallantry\" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.\n* Length\nThe novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible. The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the \"totality of life.\"<ref>[[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] ''The Theory of the Novel.

They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is \"the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism.\"<ref>\"Chivalric romance\", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).</ref> In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].\n\nOriginally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.\n\nThe shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.<ref>See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.</ref>\n\nPopular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of the medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word \"medieval\" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0-521-47735-2}}</ref>\n\nAround 1800, the connotations of \"romance\" were modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].\n\n===The novella===\n{{Main|Novella}}\n\nThe term \"novel\" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386\u20131400). The ''Decameron'' was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people\u2014seven women and three men\u2014fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.\n\n==Renaissance period: 1500\u20131700==\n[[File:1474 Melusine Ausgabe Augsburg Johann B\u00e4mler Blatt 2.png|thumb|1474: The customer in the copyist's shop with a book he wants to have copied.

Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]\u2014''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by Garc\u00eda Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.\n\n===Chapbooks===\n{{Main|Chapbook}}\nA chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].<ref name=mit.edu>{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century.

The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi\u2013volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.<ref name=\"mit.edu\"/>\n\n===Heroic romances===\n{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}\nHeroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.\n\nThe beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astr\u00e9e]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568\u20131625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of \" panache\", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603\u20131674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.\n\n===Satirical romances===\n[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]\nStories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666\u20131668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.\n\nA second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532\u20131564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.\n\nOther important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651\u201357), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715\u20131735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).<ref>Compare also: G\u00fcnter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser.

All books were sold under the rubric of \"History and politicks\" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.\n\nThat fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were \"lies\" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.\n\nThe romance format of the quasi\u2013historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[C\u00e9sar Vichard de Saint-R\u00e9al]],<ref>See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-R\u00e9al, romancier de l'histoire: une coh\u00e9rence esth\u00e9thique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).</ref> [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],<ref>Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman \u00e0 la fin du Grand Si\u00e8cle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).</ref> and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.\n\nPrefaces and title pages of seventeenth and early eighteenth century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman \u00e0 clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a \"romance\" nor a \"novel\". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.<ref>[[Daniel Defoe]], [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: [[William Taylor (bookseller)|William Taylor]], 1719)</ref>\n\n===Cervantes and the modern novel===\n{{See also|Picaresque novel}}\n\nThe rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.<ref>See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. \"Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining\" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre.

In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.\n\nInfluenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of eighteenth century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality [\u2026] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\").

The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].<ref>''The Works of T.

Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.<ref>August Bohse's (alias Talander) \"Preface\" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).</ref>\n\nThe English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720\u201322), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon|F\u00e9nelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.\n\n==19th century novels==\n\n===Romanticism===\n{{main|Romanticism}}\n{{See also|Newgate novel}}\n[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]\nThe very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).\n\nThe new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],<ref>See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).</ref> and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].<ref>See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).</ref>\n\nThe authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.\n\nThe romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journ\u00e9es de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].\n\nThe [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented \"the true historical novel\".<ref name=\"The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885\">''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed.

In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.\n\nAs the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.\n\nAlong with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.<ref>See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David & Charles, 1978), p.&nbsp;205.</ref><ref>Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852\u20132002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).</ref> Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.\n\n==The 20th century and later==\n{{See also|Modernism|Postmodernism|Antinovel|Nouveau roman}}\n\n===Modernism and post-modernism===\n[[File:Evstafiev-solzhenitsyn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], Vladivostok, 1995]]\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a \"[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\".

Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n\nPopular literature holds a larger market share. [[Romance fiction]] had an estimated $1.375&nbsp;billion share in the US book market in 2007. [[Inspirational literature]]/religious literature followed with $819&nbsp;million, [[science fiction]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] with $700&nbsp;million, [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] with $650&nbsp;million and then classic literary fiction with $466&nbsp;million.<ref>See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.<ref>John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700\u20131739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).</ref> The twentieth century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and [[hedonistic]] belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its nineteenth century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early nineteenth century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.\n\nThe authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.<ref>Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}</ref> And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.\n[[File:J. K. Rowling 2010.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[J. K. Rowling]], 2010]]\nCrime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985\u20131986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.\n\n[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].\n\n[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Chain novel]]\n* [[Children's literature]]\n* [[Gay literature]]\n* [[Nautical fiction]]\n* [[Novel in Scotland]]\n* [[Proletarian novel]]{{col-break|gap=5em}}\n* [[Psychological novel]]\n* [[Sociology of literature]]\n* [[Social novel]]\n* [[War novel]]\n* [[Web fiction]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Theories of the novel'''\n* [[Bakhtin]], Mikhail.

It was subsequently remade for ''Earthling''. \n\nA CD single for \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" was released in the United States and Canada. The single did not include the album version of the song, but instead featured [[remix]]es of the track performed by Bowie's former tourmates, [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[drum and bass]] artist [[Photek]]. Nine Inch Nails' \"V1\" mix became more popular than the original version, in large part because of the accompanying video, leading to its appearance on some editions of the retrospectives ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n\nThe ''Showgirls'' version, as well as [[Nine Inch Nails]]' \"V1\" remix and [[Mark Plati]]'s \"Original Edit,\" were included on the bonus disc of the digibook expanded edition CD of ''Earthling'' in 2004.\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

I was traveling in [[Java]] when [its] first [[McDonald's]] went up: it was like, \"for fuck's sake.\" The invasion by any [[wikt:homogenized|homogenized]] culture is so depressing, the erection of another [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney World]] in, say, [[Umbria, Italy]], more so. It strangles the indigenous culture and narrows expression of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Reviews/Albums/E/PressRelease.html |title='&#39;Earthling'&#39; press release |publisher=Teenagewildlife.com |date=25 June 1999 |accessdate=10 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308032621/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Reviews/Albums/E/PressRelease.html |archive-date=8 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Releases==\n\"I'm Afraid of Americans\" was originally engineered by [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]] and appeared as a rough mix on [[Showgirls (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the film ''[[Showgirls]]'' in 1995 (in which the chorus is \"I'm afraid of the animals,\" instead of the later \"I'm afraid of Americans\"). It was subsequently remade for ''Earthling''. \n\nA CD single for \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" was released in the United States and Canada. The single did not include the album version of the song, but instead featured [[remix]]es of the track performed by Bowie's former tourmates, [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[drum and bass]] artist [[Photek]]. Nine Inch Nails' \"V1\" mix became more popular than the original version, in large part because of the accompanying video, leading to its appearance on some editions of the retrospectives ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n\nThe ''Showgirls'' version, as well as [[Nine Inch Nails]]' \"V1\" remix and [[Mark Plati]]'s \"Original Edit,\" were included on the bonus disc of the digibook expanded edition CD of ''Earthling'' in 2004.\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

Folk costume has various details according to the place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.

These were first exhibited by company models at summer parties in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]].<ref name=\"bielefeld\"> Heidi Hagen-Pekdemir: Bielefelder machten das Dirndl erst schick.

These were first exhibited by company models at summer parties in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]].<ref name=\"bielefeld\"> Heidi Hagen-Pekdemir: Bielefelder machten das Dirndl erst schick.

He produced books and diaries even when he was in the jail. \n\n== Books ==\nFollowing books are on his credit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sindhsalamat.com/threads/12066/|title=\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0641 - \u06aa\u0647\u0627\u06bb\u064a\u06aa\u0627\u0631 \u060c \u0646\u0642\u0627\u062f \u06fd \u0627\u064a\u068a\u064a\u067d\u0631 (\u0648\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0621 \u062a\u064a \u06a9\u064a\u0633 \u0680\u064a\u067d\u0627)|website=SindhSalamat|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.sindhsalamat.com:443/author.php?id=404|title=\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0641 {{!}} \u0633\u0646\u068c \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u06aa\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u06af\u0647\u0631|website=books.sindhsalamat.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>:\n* Soonhan, Pathar and Piyar (\u0633\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0646\u060c \u067e\u067f\u0631 \u06fd \u067e\u064a\u0627\u0631), short stories (1964)\n* Zindageea Jo Tanha Musafir (\u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u064a\u0621\u064e \u062c\u0648 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0631), short stories (1978)\n* Darid Ja Deenhan, Dard Joon Ratiyoon (\u062f\u0631\u062f \u062c\u0627 \u068f\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0646\u060c \u062f\u0631\u062f \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0648\u0646), short stories (1982)\n* Band Akhiun Men, Kujh Sapna Kujh Yadoon (\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u06a9\u064a\u0646 \u06fe \u06aa\u062c\u0647 \u0633\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u06aa\u062c\u0647 \u064a\u0627\u062f\u0648\u0646) (1992)\n* Baweeha Mahina Jail Men (\u067b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u06be \u0645\u0647\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u062c\u064a\u0644 \u06fe) (Two Parts), Jail Diary\n* Jail Gharium Jin San (\u062c\u064a\u0644 \u06af\u0647\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u062c\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0646)\n* Adh Mulaqat (\u0627\u068c \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a)\n* Meeru Dhareil (\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0648 \u068c\u0627\u0699\u064a\u0644), Novel\n\n== Death ==\nTarique Ashraf died on 14 April 1992 in [[Karachi]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.pk/story/557059/|title=\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06be\u06cc \u0627\u062f\u0628 \u06a9\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0641 (\u0622\u062e\u0631\u06cc \u062d\u0635\u06c1)|date=2016-07-14|website=\u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0633 \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>.\n\n== References ==\n\n\n[[Category: Sindhi-language writers]]\n[[Category: Writers from Sindh]]\n[[Category: Pakistani writers]]\n[[Category: People from Hyderabad, Sindh]]\n[[Category: 1940 births]]\n[[Category: 1992 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Ashraf"}
