The airport is a technical base and focus city for [[Air Greenland]], the [[flag carrier]] airline of Greenland, linking the capital with several towns in western and south-western part of the country, including the airline hub at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]. With connections to [[Iceland]], Nuuk Airport is also one of six international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]] in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[seaplane]]s of the newly established Air Greenland landed in [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]]. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s.\n\nThe airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large [[airliner]]s or flights reaching Denmark or other countries. In connection with events are chartered aircraft or VIP flights unable to reach Nuuk. A change to a small local aircraft (normally at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]) is always needed. A large expansion of the airport has been controversial due to the approach near the urbanized area of the outlying districts of Nuuk, although the issue continues to be a subject of internal debate in Greenland.\n\nA new international airport is slated for completion in 2023.<ref>https://politiken.dk/indland/art7331116/Nye-lufthavne-i-Gr%C3%B8nland-bliver-realitet-i-urolig-tid</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Seaplane era===\nIn the early 1960s, after the establishment of [[Air Greenland]] on 7 November 1960 as '''Gr\u00f8nlandsfly''',<ref name=\"anni60\">{{cite web |url=http://50.airgreenland.dk/60'erne/ |title=Greenlandair 1960\u201369 |publisher=Air Greenland |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> Nuuk was served exclusively by the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]], with the aircraft using the waterways of the [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]] as a landing site.<ref name=\"anni60\"/> In 1962 a PBY Catalina crashed near the port, killing 15 people on board.<ref name=\"anni60\"/>\n\n===Helicopter era===\n[[File:Air-Greenland-sikorsky-s61n-ilulissat-airport.jpg|thumb|The [[Sikorsky S-61]]N helicopter connected Nuuk with smaller towns for more than four decades.]]\nThe tragedy was one of the factors leading to the decision to invest in a helicopter fleet.

The airport is a technical base and focus city for [[Air Greenland]], the [[flag carrier]] airline of Greenland, linking the capital with several towns in western and south-western part of the country, including the airline hub at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]. With connections to [[Iceland]], Nuuk Airport is also one of six international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]] in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[seaplane]]s of the newly established Air Greenland landed in [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]]. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s.\n\nThe airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large [[airliner]]s or flights reaching Denmark or other countries.

In general the short runway is a problem for large events in Nuuk. Charter and extra flights from outside Greenland can not land in Nuuk (or any other city of Greenland), so Air Greenland need to shuttle passengers between Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk, using planes much smaller than the charter planes, often requiring a hotel night in Kangerlussuaq.<ref>[http://www.mit.gl/stor-tilfredshed-med-indsatsen-i-forbindelse-med-arctic-winter-games/ Stor tilfredshed med indsatsen i forbindelse med Arctic Winter Games] (17 March 2016, in Danish)</ref>\n\n===Runway expansion===\nNuuk airport has one asphalt runway (05/23) {{convert|950|x|30|m|abbr=on|0}} {{convert|283|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> The airport terminal and apron are built on a levelled platform on an undulating slope under the Quassussuaq mountain, with the runway platform artificially elevated to compensate for the scarp immediately to the west.

After 2010 there are no aircraft that can be purchased, which have more than 30 seats and can use short runways like Nuuk.

An expansion of the runway in that direction would require relocation of the connecting road, which climbs under the runway scarp. An often-discussed extension of the runway<ref name=\"extend\"/><ref name=\"sayno\"/> in the other direction would have brought the endpoint close to [[Qinngorput]], the newest district of Nuuk, rapidly expanding in the late 2000s. Also an expansion should not obstruct ongoing traffic since there is no other runway or airport reachable by road.\n\nSuggestions were extend it from {{convert|950|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|1199|m|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.knr.gl/index.php?id=183&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=45110&cHash=8379ea778c |title=Seri\u00f8se planer om at udvide lufthavnen i Nuuk |work=[[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]] |language=Danish |date=24 May 2009|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> to {{convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} (the longest possible) the latter which would allow direct flights to Denmark, but only with medium-size jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737]] or [[Airbus A320]] instead of the large [[Airbus A330]] used at present.

Doris Lessing's first novel, ''[[The Grass Is Singing]]'', as well as the collection of short stories ''African Stories'', are set in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) where she was then living.\n\nThis was followed by a [[Psychology|psychological]] phase from 1956 to 1969, including the ''Golden Notebook'' and the \"Children of Violence\" quartet.\n\nThird came the [[Sufism|Sufi]] phase, explored in the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' sequence of science fiction (or as she preferred to put it \"space fiction\") novels and novellas.\n\nLessing's ''Canopus'' sequence was not popular with many mainstream [[literary critic]]s. For example, in ''The New York Times'' in 1982 [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]] wrote in reference to ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' that \"[o]ne of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing...

Using [[Sufi]] concepts, to which Lessing had been introduced in the mid-1960s by her \"good friend and teacher\" [[Idries Shah]],<ref name=\"Lessingon\"/> the series of novels also uses an approach similar to that employed by the early 20th century mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] in his work ''[[All and Everything]]''. Earlier works of \"inner space\" fiction like ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing's interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned.<ref>\"Postcolonial Nostalgias: Writing, Representation and Memory\", Volume 31 of ''Routledge research in postcolonial literatures'', Dennis Walder, Taylor & Francis ltd, 2010, p92. {{ISBN|9780203840382}}.</ref>\n\nLessing's novel ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' is considered a feminist classic by some scholars,<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|title=Fresh Air Remembers 'Golden Notebook' Author Doris Lessing|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=245955408|accessdate=19 November 2013|publisher=NPR|date=18 November 2013}}</ref> but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns as a means of healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in ''Walking in the Shade'' that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend [[Joan Rodker]], the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher [[John Rodker]].<ref>Scott, Lynda, [http://www.otago.ac.nz/DeepSouth/0498/0498lynda.htm \"Lessing's Early and Transitional Novels: The Beginnings of a Sense of Selfhood\"], ''Deepsouth'', vol. 4, no. 1 (Autumn 1998). Retrieved 17 October 2007.</ref>\n\nLessing did not like being pigeon-holed as a feminist author. When asked why, she explained: {{Quote|What the feminists want of me is something they haven't examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, 'Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.' Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do. I've come with great regret to this conclusion.|Doris Lessing|''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 July 1982<ref name=\"space fiction\"/>}}\n\n==Doris Lessing Society==\nThe Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing's work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the ''Doris Lessing Newsletter'' was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal ''Doris Lessing Studies''. The Society also organises panels at the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Languages Association (MLA)]] annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in [[New Orleans]] in 2004 and [[Leeds]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dorislessingsociety.wordpress.com/|title=Doris Lessing Society|website=Doris Lessing Society}}</ref>\n\n==Archives==\nLessing's literary archive is held by the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999.

Using [[Sufi]] concepts, to which Lessing had been introduced in the mid-1960s by her \"good friend and teacher\" [[Idries Shah]],<ref name=\"Lessingon\"/> the series of novels also uses an approach similar to that employed by the early 20th century mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] in his work ''[[All and Everything]]''. Earlier works of \"inner space\" fiction like ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing's interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned.<ref>\"Postcolonial Nostalgias: Writing, Representation and Memory\", Volume 31 of ''Routledge research in postcolonial literatures'', Dennis Walder, Taylor & Francis ltd, 2010, p92. {{ISBN|9780203840382}}.</ref>\n\nLessing's novel ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' is considered a feminist classic by some scholars,<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|title=Fresh Air Remembers 'Golden Notebook' Author Doris Lessing|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=245955408|accessdate=19 November 2013|publisher=NPR|date=18 November 2013}}</ref> but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns as a means of healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in ''Walking in the Shade'' that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend [[Joan Rodker]], the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher [[John Rodker]].<ref>Scott, Lynda, [http://www.otago.ac.nz/DeepSouth/0498/0498lynda.htm \"Lessing's Early and Transitional Novels: The Beginnings of a Sense of Selfhood\"], ''Deepsouth'', vol. 4, no. 1 (Autumn 1998).

When asked why, she explained: {{Quote|What the feminists want of me is something they haven't examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, 'Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.' Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do. I've come with great regret to this conclusion.|Doris Lessing|''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 July 1982<ref name=\"space fiction\"/>}}\n\n==Doris Lessing Society==\nThe Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing's work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the ''Doris Lessing Newsletter'' was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal ''Doris Lessing Studies''. The Society also organises panels at the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Languages Association (MLA)]] annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in [[New Orleans]] in 2004 and [[Leeds]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dorislessingsociety.wordpress.com/|title=Doris Lessing Society|website=Doris Lessing Society}}</ref>\n\n==Archives==\nLessing's literary archive is held by the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999. Original material for Lessing's early books is assumed not to exist because she kept none of her early manuscripts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2007/lessing.html|title=Harry Ransom Center Holds Archive of Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing|accessdate=17 March 2008|publisher= hrc.utexas.edu}}</ref> The [[Robert M.

The airport is located 38 kilometers west of the city of Ambon. The airport was named after [[Pattimura]], an [[National Hero of Indonesia|Indonesian national hero]] who fought against the Dutch colonialists in the nineteenth century.

In early February 1942, the airport was captured by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Ambon]] and used as a base for the Japanese to do battle against the allied forces in the Pacific.\nAfter the independence of Indonesia was proclaimed, Pattimura was used as an air base. This lasted until August 1, 1962, when the government formed a working unit in charge of organizing the civil aviation maintenance and operation of airports for the benefit of civil air transport. Pattimura Airport continued to be operated as an Air Force Air Base. Based on the Joint Decree of the Minister of Defense / Armed Forces Commander, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance, in 1975, Pattimura airport was designated as a civilian airfield and came under the full control of the Department of Transportation. On October 11, 1995, the management of the Pattimura Airport was transferred to PT.

The domestic terminal is 7,393 m<sup>2</sup> (gates A & B) and has an annual capacity of 406,000 passengers.\n\nCurrently there are no regularly scheduled international flights to or from Ambon, so the international terminal is used for domestic flights which are operated with larger airplanes and can make use of the two jet bridges for easier loading and unloading of the airplanes \u2013 especially during rain.\n\nThe cargo terminal size is 1,192 m<sup>2</sup>.
