[[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|His disclosures]] revealed numerous [[global surveillance]] programs, many run by the NSA and the [[Five Eyes|Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance]] with the cooperation of [[Telephone company|telecommunication companies]] and European governments, and prompted a [[Reactions to global surveillance disclosures|cultural discussion]] about [[national security]] and individual privacy.\n\nIn 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], after previous employment with [[Dell]] and the CIA.<ref name=\"VanityFair\">{{cite news |first1=Bryan |last1=Burrough |first2=Sarah |last2=Ellison |first3=Suzanna |last3=Andrews |title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light |date=April 23, 2014 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |website=Vanity Fair |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview }}</ref> Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to [[Hong Kong]] after leaving his job at an [[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|NSA facility in Hawaii]], and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists [[Glenn Greenwald]], [[Laura Poitras]], and [[Ewen MacAskill]]. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Further disclosures were made by other publications including ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice]] unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and theft of government property,<ref name=\"wapocharges\" /> following which the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] revoked his passport.<ref name=\"KerryPassport\" /> Two days later, he flew into [[Moscow]]'s [[Sheremetyevo Airport]], where Russian authorities noted that his [[U.S. passport]] had been cancelled, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the [[right of asylum]] with an initial visa for residence for one year, and repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. In early 2016, he became the president of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]], a San Francisco-based organization that states its purpose is to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/reporters-need-edward-snowden/|title=Edward Snowden's New Job: Protecting Reporters From Spies|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=February 2017|first=Andy|last=Greenberg |accessdate=October 23, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 2019, his memoir ''[[Permanent Record (autobiography)|Permanent Record]]'' was published.<ref name=\"I was very much a person the most powerful government in the world wanted to go away\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/edward-snowden-interview-whistleblowing-russia-ai-permanent-record|title=I was very much a person the most powerful government in the world wanted to go away|last1=McAskill|first1=Ewan|date=September 13, 2019|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=September 14, 2019}}</ref> On the first day of publication, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit against Snowden over publication of his memoir, alleging he had breached nondisclosure agreements signed with the U.S. federal government.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Tom McCarthy |author2=David Smith |title=US government files civil lawsuit against Snowden over publication of memoir |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/17/edward-snowden-memoir-us-government-lawsuit |accessdate=September 18, 2019 |agency=The Guardian |date=September 17, 2019}}</ref> Former ''The Guardian'' national security reporter [[Ewen MacAskill]] called the civil lawsuit a \"huge mistake\", noting that the \"UK ban of ''[[Spycatcher]]'' 30 years ago created huge demand\".<ref>{{Cite tweet|user=ewenmacaskill |number=1174062740488577025|title=Huge mistake by US govt in filing civil lawsuit against Snowden over publication of memoir.

The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act.

The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act.

Released in 2006, it was a finalist for the [[Michael L. Printz Award]].\n\nThe novel includes an appendix by [[Daniel Biss]], a close friend of Green, that explains some of the more complex equations used by the main character, Colin Singleton.\n\n==Plot summary==\nColin Singleton, a child prodigy living in [[Chicago]], fears he will not maintain his genius as an adult. Over the span of his life, Colin has dated nineteen girls named Katherine, all spelled in that manner.  After being dumped by his girlfriend, Katherine XIX, Colin is longing to feel whole, and longing to matter. He hopes to become a genius by having a \"[[eureka effect|eureka]]\" moment.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, and before college, Colin's best and only friend, Hassan Harbish, convinces him to go on a road trip to take his mind off the breakup. Colin goes, hoping to find his \"eureka\" moment. After reaching a rural [[Tennessee]] town called Gutshot , they visit the supposed resting place of  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. There, they meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother Hollis, whose family runs a local textile mill. Hollis allows Colin and Hassan to stay with her family, and offers them a summer job of interviewing the town's residents and assemble an oral history of it.\n\nColin begins to like Lindsey, though he is foiled by her boyfriend, Colin Lyford (he and Hassan call him TOC, \"the other Colin\"). Colin is still chasing his eureka moment, finally finding it in his theorem he created called the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability. The theorem determines the curve of any relationship based on several factors of the personalities of the two people in a relationship. His theorem eventually works for all but one of his past relationships with a Katherine\u2014which the novel explores.\n\nWhile the back stories of Colin\u2019s life play out, Hassan gets a girlfriend, Katrina, a friend of Lindsey\u2019s. The relationship is cut short when Colin and Hassan catch Katrina having sex with Lyford while on a feral hog hunt with Lindsey, her friends and Lyford's father. A fight between Lyford and all of the surrounding acquaintances begins when Lindsey finds out that he\u2019s been cheating on her. While injured in the fight, Colin anagrams the Archduke's name while in the grave yard to dull the pain, and realizes that it is actually Lindsey's great-grandfather, named Fred N. Dinzanfar, that is buried in the tomb.\n\nColin finds Lindsey at her secret hideout in a cave, where he tells her the story of every Katherine he has ever loved. Lindsey tells him how she does not feel sad but instead slightly relieved by Lyford's affair. They discuss what it means to them to \"matter\" and eventually confess their love for each other. As their relationship continues, Colin decides to use his dating formula to determine whether or not he and Lindsey will last. The graph reveals that they will only last for four more days. Lindsey then slips a note under his door, four days later, stating that she cannot be his girlfriend because she is in love with Hassan. But she leaves a P.S. stating that she is joking. Colin realizes that his theorem cannot predict the future of a relationship; it can only shed light on why a relationship failed. Despite this, Colin is content with not \"mattering\". Hassan also states that he is applying for two college classes, which Colin has been trying to convince him to do throughout the book. The story ends with the trio driving past the restaurant they were originally planning on going to, because Colin, Lindsey, and Hassan realize that they can just keep driving; there is nothing stopping them from continuing on.\n\n==Main characters==\n;Colin Singleton: Colin Singleton is an anagram-loving seventeen-year-old boy who is depressed. Though he was a child-prodigy with an IQ of over 200, he has not yet become a \"genius\". Colin finds everything interesting, especially things that other people seem to not care much about. Because of this, it is difficult for people to relate to Colin. After only dating Katherines, Colin breaks the streak by dating Lindsey Lee Wells, whom he met on his road trip with Hassan. Throughout the novel Colin feels as though there is a hole in his stomach, and he is looking to fill it. Colin spends his time striving to be unique, but with Lindsey's help, ends up coming to the realization that he is \"not-unique in the very best way possible.\"\n;Hassan Harbish: Hassan Harbish is Colin Singleton's lazy, funny, and slightly overweight best, and only, friend. Though he is smart and has been accepted to college, Hassan takes a year off. At first Hassan does not seem to plan furthering his education. He convinces Colin to go on a road trip in order to break out of his depression. Hassan is Muslim and prays regularly, acting with strict religiosity, until he dates Katrina. Hassan is an integral part to Colin's journey of finding his true identity.\n;Lindsey Lee Wells: Lindsey Lee Wells meets Colin Singleton and Hassan Harbish on their road trip in Gutshot, Tennessee. She is a paramedic-in-training who also gives tours of Gutshot. When Lindsey first appears in the novel, she is dating Colin Lyford. However, she doesn't feel like she is truly herself until she starts hanging around Colin Singleton. Like Singleton, Lindsey seems to be struggling with her identity. Inspired by Colin Singleton's ability to always be himself, Lindsey finally becomes herself. She also becomes Singleton's girlfriend after her break-up from Lyford.\n;Hollis Wells: Lindsey's mother. An extreme workaholic. Very kind to the people who work at her factory.\n\n==Style and format==\nThe novel is written in a [[third-person narrative]]. Green used third person to create empathy for Colin. In a blog post, Green wrote that the novel \"needed to be written in third person, because it's about a guy whose brain does not lend itself to narratives, and who struggles to tell stories in ways other people find interesting.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/>\n\nThe story includes many footnotes that become an essential part to understanding Colin's brain and how it works. Green says that the footnotes \"function as a kind of competing narrative that comments upon and\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014problematizes the central narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Questions about An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|website=John Green Books|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=24 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003359/http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''An Abundance of Katherines'' is a fiction work that includes many mathematical terms and academic language.

These chapters include Colin's flashbacks, which are \"meant to reflect the relationship we have between chronological narrative and emotional narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/> This format is also known as [[non-linear narrative]].\n\n==Symbols==\n;Archduke Franz Ferdinand: Franz Ferdinand is an anagram of Lindsey's great grandpa's name, Fred N. Dinzanfar. Ferdinand becomes a symbol of what matters to Colin most: mattering. Though Ferdinand is famous, he did not really do much; he is famous for being shot. \"While some people are remembered, others are forgotten, and a lot of times it doesn't matter whether we try to do something noteworthy or not.
