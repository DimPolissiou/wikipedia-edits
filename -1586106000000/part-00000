The death rate among adults had risen from one person per 1000 per year in October 1632 to twenty in the month of March 1633. After their vow, the adult death rate slowly subsided to one in the month of July 1633. The villagers believed they had been spared and thus kept their part of the vow when the play was first performed in 1634.\n\nThe play is now performed repeatedly over the course of five months during every year ending in zero.  102 performances took place from 15 May until 3 October 2010 and is next scheduled for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bavaria.by/|title=Holiday in Bavaria Germany - visit sights, cities, attractions, hotels - BavariaTourism|website=Bayern Tourismus|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> (The 2020 play is being postponed to 2022 due to the outbreak of COVID-19.) The production involves over 2,000 performers, musicians and stage technicians, all residents of the village.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passionsspiele-oberammergau.de/en |title=Passion Play 2020 Oberammergau |publisher=Passionsspiele Oberammergau |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> The play comprises spoken dramatic text, musical and choral accompaniment and ''tableaux vivants'', which are scenes from the [[Old Testament]] depicted for the audience by motionless actors accompanied by verbal description.  These scenes are the basis for the typology, the interrelationship between the Old and [[New Testament]]s, of the play. They include a scene of [[King Ahasuerus]] rejecting [[Vashti]] in favor of [[Esther]], the brothers selling [[Joseph (dreamer)|Joseph]] into slavery in [[Egypt]], and [[Moses]] raising up the [[nehushtan]] ([[bronze]] [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]) in the wilderness.  Each scene precedes that section of the play that is considered to be prefigured by the scene. The three ''tableaux'' mentioned are presented to the audience as prefiguring Christianity [[supersessionism|superseding]] Judaism, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] selling information on the location of Jesus, and the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe evolution of the [[Passion Play]] was about the same as that of the [[Easter Play]], originating in the ritual of the Latin Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on [[Good Friday]] should be sung in parts divided among various persons.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Plot synopsis==\n'''Prelude'''\n\nThe prologue and chorus greet the audience. Two tableaux are presented.  In the first, [[Adam and Eve]], wearing sheepskins are banished from the [[Garden of Eden]] by a winged angel who holds a sword in the form of a flame.  Behind the angel stands a burst of gilded rays symbolizing the tree of [[forbidden fruit]].  The second living picture traditionally showed a number of girls and smaller children surrounding a cross at center stage.  The adoration represents the time in 1633 when villagers swore their vow before a huge crucifix bearing a twelve-foot-high Jesus.\n\n'''Act 1'''\n''[[Jesus and the Money Changers]].'' Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey to the shouts and exultation of the people on [[Palm Sunday]].  He drives the money changers and traders from the Temple then returns to Bethany.\n\n'''Act 2'''\n''Conspiracy of the High Council.'' In the past, this act began with a tableau showing the sons of the patriarch [[Jacob]] conspiring to kill [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] in the Plain of Dothan; the frieze was deleted from the 1980 presentation.  The act consists of discussions between the traders and [[Sanhedrin]], who agree that Jesus must be arrested to preserve [[Mosaic law]].\n\n'''Act 3'''\n''Parting at Bethany.'' Two tableaux presage the action.  In the first, the young Tobias departs from his parents while the angel Raphael, played by another boy, waits, crook in hand, stage left.  In the second, the loving bridesmaid from the [[Song of Solomon]] laments the loss of her groom.  In the play, Christ is anointed by [[Mary Magdalene]], then takes leave of his mother and friends.  Judas is angered by the waste of the spikenard oil.\n\n'''Act 4'''\n''The Last Journey to Jerusalem.'' A controversial tableau (now deleted) showed [[Queen Vashti]] dishonored at the court of King [[Ahasuerus]].  The old queen (Judaism, explains the Prologue) has been displaced by [[Esther]] (Christianity). Jesus sends two disciples to secure a [[Passover sacrifice|Paschal lamb]].  He enters Jerusalem for the last time and weeps over the fate of the city.  Judas contemplates betraying his master and is tempted by Dathan and other merchants.\n\n'''Act 5'''\n''[[The Last Supper]].'' The [[Passover Seder]] or Last Supper is celebrated in a scene evocative of the famous [[Da Vinci]] painting.  Jesus washes the feet of his disciples and institutes the mass with wine and thick, brown, leavened bread.  Two tableaux show [[Moses]] with rays or horns protruding from his head, bringing manna and grapes to the people in the wilderness.\n\n'''Act 6'''\n''The Betrayer.'' In a tableau, Joseph, a boy nude to the waist, is sold by his brothers to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver.  In accompanying action, Judas appears before the Sanhedrin and promises to deliver Jesus for [[thirty pieces of silver]].  After his departure, the [[Pharisees]] plan at great length the death of Jesus.\n\n'''Act 7'''\n''Jesus at the [[Mount of Olives]].'' Two more Old Testament scenes introduce the soliloquy of Jesus in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].  The first, a non-sequitur, which we are told explains that man must earn his food by the sweat of his brow, shows Adam, in sheepskin and assisted by a brood of similarly attired children, drawing a plow across a field.  The second frieze more appropriately offers a helmeted Joab, surrounded by soldiers stabbing an unsuspecting Amasa in the ribs.  Christ agonizes over his fate while his apostles doze.  Judas enters with an armed band and betrays Jesus with a kiss.\n\n'''Act 8'''\n''Jesus before [[Annas]].''  The Old Testament parallel has Micah slapped on the cheek by Zedekiah, priest of Baal, for daring to predict King Ahab would die in battle.  In like manner, Jesus is taken before a waiting, eager Annas and is struck on the face for his insolence.  Soldiers also deride Christ as he is led though the streets by a rope.\n\n'''Act 9'''\n''Condemned by the High Council.'' Two more tableaux emphasize the humiliation of Christ.  In one, the aged Naboth is condemned by false witnesses and is stoned to death by the sons of Jezebel.  In the other, Job, sitting on a dunghill is railed at by his friends, servants, even his wife and children.  Meanwhile, Jesus is questioned by [[Caiaphas]] about his [[messiah]]-ship and is condemned.  A tortured Judas tries to get the Sanhedrin to repeal its verdict.  When his efforts prove unsuccessful, he tosses the money back at them and storms off.\n\n'''Act 10'''\n''Despair of Judas.'' Judas and all who identify with him are linked with Cain in the opening tableau.  The battered body of Abel appears at center stage.  To the right is Cain, clad in a leopard skin and holding a club in one hand.  His other hand is at his brow, attempting to conceal the brand of God.  In this short act Judas offers a speech of remorse then hangs himself.\n\n'''Act 11'''\n''Christ before [[Pilate]].'' Originally there was a frieze which heralded Christ's first appearance before Pilate.  The tableau of Daniel in the great pillared hall of Darius was deleted from later twentieth-century productions.  Pilate's interrogation, coupled with news of his wife's dream, convinces the governor that Jesus should be prosecuted by [[Herod Antipas]] for lese majesty.\n\n'''Act 12'''\n''Christ Before Herod.'' The scene stands without the original living picture which showed a blinded [[Samson]] mocked by the [[Philistines]].  Herod treats Christ with scorn, demanding a miracle, then sends him back to Pilate, cloaked in a red mantle of royalty.  Responding to the urging of the Sanhedrin, Pilate reluctantly agrees to have Jesus scourged.  [[Classical Rome|Roman]] guards beat Jesus and press a [[crown of thorns]] into his scalp.\n\n'''Act 13'''\n''Christ Sentenced to Death on the Cross.'' Two graphic pictures showing the presentation of Joseph's bloodied coat to Jacob, and [[Abraham]] about to stab Isaac on [[Moriah|Mt. Moriah]] have been rejected from contemporary versions of the Passion.  Retained, however, are tableaux which show Joseph riding a sedan chair as vizir of Egypt and another which supposedly represents the scapegoat offering of [[Yom Kippur]].  Following the tableaux, the stage is swarming with action as priests and Pharisees bring mobs from every direction.  Pilate gives Jesus another hearing then offers the people a choice between Jesus and [[Barabbas]].  They demand and receive a final judgement on Christ.\n\n'''Act 14'''\n''[[The Way of the Cross]].'' The final segment of the Passion is introduced by a more sublime image of the ''[[Akedah]],'' or binding of Isaac.  In this tableau, the boy, like Jesus, carries wood on his back as he and Abraham climb Mt. Moriah.  Another frieze, showing Moses and a bronze serpent intertwined about the cross has been deleted.  When the chorus withdraws from the stage Christ bears his cross to [[Golgotha]].  As he passes through the streets he encounters his mother, Veronica, and [[Simon of Cyrene]].  The women of Jerusalem weep for him.\n\n'''Act 15'''\n''Jesus on [[Calvary]].'' For the first time the chorus appears in black traditional mourning garb.  There is no tableau.  He is mocked by members of the Sanhedrin and the soldiers and utters his last words.  The legs of the criminals are broken.  A soldier pierces the side of Christ with a lance and blood gushes forth.  Jesus' followers slowly and reverently take down the body and lay it before his mother in a replica of the [[Pieta]].  The Sanhedrin insists that guards be posted before the tomb which is to hold Christ's body.\n\n'''Act 16'''\n''[[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and [[Apotheosis]].'' For the first time, action precedes a tableau.  Roman guards see a light at the tomb.  Mary Magdalene and the other women encounter an angel and recite the same lines as ''[[Quem Quaeritis]].''  The final tableau shows Jesus resplendent in white with his apostles, angels, the Virgin Mary, and Moses.  The Passion ends with a proclamation by the chorus.<ref name=Friedman/>\n\n==Length and frequency==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nThe Oberammergau production takes place in one day,<ref name=Moses>{{cite book|last=Moses|first=Montrose J.|title=The Passion Play of Oberammergau| year=1930|publisher=The Cornwall Press|location=Cornwall, NY}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} but the running time has varied due to the many revisions that have taken place through the years.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2010 it had a running time of 5 hours, beginning at 2:30 pm and ending at 10:00 pm, with a meal break.

By the middle of the 18th century it was obvious that the graveyard was also too small and a new venue was found on a field close by; however, the stage had to be specially built every year of the Play.\n\nThe first permanent stage seems to have been built in 1815 to a design by the then-local parish priest. In 1830 he was asked to help build a new, larger stage on the site of the present theatre. When it rained the audience got wet: umbrellas would have obscured the view of people sitting behind them.\n\nHowever, in 1890 a new, purpose-built theatre was built and, apart from some of the scenes on the side of the stage, it would have looked much as it does today. It was ready in time for the 1900 performance, with the six-arched hall capable of holding over 4000 spectators.\n\nThe theatre was enlarged in time for the 1930 and 1934 seasons and whilst it was considered ugly and uncomfortable it was praised for its superb acoustics and sight of the stage.\n\nFollowing the 1990 production both the interior and fa\u00e7ade of the theatre were renovated and the stage mechanics modernised.\n\nIt has now been transformed - new more comfortable seating has been installed along with under-floor heating; cloakrooms have been extended; the foyer made accessible for wheelchair users; exhibition areas added; safety and toilet facilities improved.\n\nToday the theatre can seat an audience of over 4700.\n\n==Antisemitism==\nPrevious versions of the play were [[Anti-Semitism#Passion plays|anti-Semitic]] in character, blaming the Jews for the \"murder\" of Christ.<ref name=Shapiro/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}  [[Adolf Hitler]] indicated, according to [[Abe Foxman]], approval of these allegedly anti-Semitic elements in the ''Oberammergau Passion Play''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Passion problems |date=2004-03-04 |first=Abraham H. |last=Foxman |journal=National Review}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 review in the Jewish newspaper \"[[The Forward]]\" stated: \"It is undeniably true that the play was virulently antisemitic through most of its history, and that it gained an extra dose of notoriety after Hitler endorsed the 1934 production.\"<ref name=Goldmann>Goldmann, A.

In the 1970s, Oberammergau invited representatives from Jewish organizations to revise the play, and revisions were approved by a Christian theological advisor.<ref name=Goldmann/> 2000 and 2010 director Christian St\u00fcckl told \"The Forward\" that Jesus \"lived as a Jew.\" Therefore, in the revised play, Jesus and his disciples pray in Hebrew. After viewing the play, the reviewer was sympathetic to its artistry and felt less offended by its message than by \"Wagner\u2019s antisemitic caricatures and religious mysticism\".<ref name=Goldmann/> Nonetheless, the review quoted a report from the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations, which reviewed the 2010 script and objected that the play still makes use of \"elements that are historically dubious\" from the Gospels. The review stated that \"It seems unfair\" to accuse the play of anti-semitism when it recounts material in Christianity\u2019s sacred texts and noted that the ADL's national director Abe Foxman had said that if the play is \"about a Crucifixion in which the Jews kill Christ, you can never clean it up enough\" to avoid an anti-semitic message.<ref name=Goldmann/>\n\nIn 2010, there was a new production directed by Oberammergau native Christian St\u00fcckl, director at Munich's Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier and music director Markus Zwink and conductor Michael Bocklet - all from Oberammergau. The play started each day at 14.30 and including a three-hour supper interval ended at 22.30. This was an innovation, since previous productions had been performed in the morning and afternoon with a break for lunch. \n\nThe changes to the play since World War II have included the manner in which the play presents the charge of [[deicide]], collective guilt, [[supersessionism]] and typology, as well as the following:\n\n*the role of the Temple traders has been reduced;\n*the character \"Rabbi\" has been eliminated and his lines given to another character;\n*Jewish priests no longer wear horn-shaped hats;\n*Jesus has been addressed as Rabbi Yeshua;\n*Jesus and others speak fragments of Hebrew prayers in the play;\n*Jews are shown disputing with others about theological aspects of Judaism, not just about Jesus;\n*Pilate has been made to appear more tyrannical and threatens Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest, and it is made clear that Caiaphas does not speak for all the Jews;\n*Romans now stand guard at the gates when Jesus makes his entrance to Jerusalem;\n*Jesus' supporters have been added to the screaming crowd outside Pilate's palace;\n*Judas is portrayed as being duped into betraying Jesus;\n*removing the line \"His blood is upon us and also upon our children's children\" (from [[Matthew 27:25]]), and \"[[Ecce homo]]\" (Behold [only] a man);\n*[[Saint Peter|Peter]], when questioned by Nathaniel regarding abandoning [[Judaism]] replies, \"No!

Among other things, the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] ordered the official poster for the jubilee season amended to include the message \"Deutschland ruft dich!\" (\"Germany is calling you!\"), and the ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' scheme's discount-travel programme offered special cut-rate packages for the Passion Play, including train fare, tickets and accommodations.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nOfficial propaganda described the Passion Play as \"peasant drama ... inspired by the consecrating power of the soil\", and Hitler attended a performance. An attempt to rewrite the Passion Play script to bring it into line with Nazi ideology was rejected, however, by the more conservative element.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Papal protective measures to ensure soundness of doctrine===\nMissio Canonica is a canonical certification necessary for preaching. In 19th-century Germany it was extended to teaching as well. In 1922 the Catholic Church gave the play a ''[[Missio Canonica]]''.

The death rate among adults had risen from one person per 1000 per year in October 1632 to twenty in the month of March 1633. After their vow, the adult death rate slowly subsided to one in the month of July 1633. The villagers believed they had been spared and thus kept their part of the vow when the play was first performed in 1634.\n\nThe play is now performed repeatedly over the course of five months during every year ending in zero.  102 performances took place from 15 May until 3 October 2010 and is next scheduled for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bavaria.by/|title=Holiday in Bavaria Germany - visit sights, cities, attractions, hotels - BavariaTourism|website=Bayern Tourismus|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> (The 2020 play is being postponed to 2022 due to the outbreak of COVID-19.) The production involves over 2,000 performers, musicians and stage technicians, all residents of the village.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passionsspiele-oberammergau.de/en |title=Passion Play 2020 Oberammergau |publisher=Passionsspiele Oberammergau |accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> The play comprises spoken dramatic text, musical and choral accompaniment and ''tableaux vivants'', which are scenes from the [[Old Testament]] depicted for the audience by motionless actors accompanied by verbal description.  These scenes are the basis for the typology, the interrelationship between the Old and [[New Testament]]s, of the play. They include a scene of [[King Ahasuerus]] rejecting [[Vashti]] in favor of [[Esther]], the brothers selling [[Joseph (dreamer)|Joseph]] into slavery in [[Egypt]], and [[Moses]] raising up the [[nehushtan]] ([[bronze]] [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]) in the wilderness.  Each scene precedes that section of the play that is considered to be prefigured by the scene. The three ''tableaux'' mentioned are presented to the audience as prefiguring Christianity [[supersessionism|superseding]] Judaism, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] selling information on the location of Jesus, and the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe evolution of the [[Passion Play]] was about the same as that of the [[Easter Play]], originating in the ritual of the Latin Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on [[Good Friday]] should be sung in parts divided among various persons.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Plot synopsis==\n'''Prelude'''\n\nThe prologue and chorus greet the audience. Two tableaux are presented.  In the first, [[Adam and Eve]], wearing sheepskins are banished from the [[Garden of Eden]] by a winged angel who holds a sword in the form of a flame.  Behind the angel stands a burst of gilded rays symbolizing the tree of [[forbidden fruit]].  The second living picture traditionally showed a number of girls and smaller children surrounding a cross at center stage.  The adoration represents the time in 1633 when villagers swore their vow before a huge crucifix bearing a twelve-foot-high Jesus.\n\n'''Act 1'''\n''[[Jesus and the Money Changers]].'' Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey to the shouts and exultation of the people on [[Palm Sunday]].  He drives the money changers and traders from the Temple then returns to Bethany.\n\n'''Act 2'''\n''Conspiracy of the High Council.'' In the past, this act began with a tableau showing the sons of the patriarch [[Jacob]] conspiring to kill [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] in the Plain of Dothan; the frieze was deleted from the 1980 presentation.  The act consists of discussions between the traders and [[Sanhedrin]], who agree that Jesus must be arrested to preserve [[Mosaic law]].\n\n'''Act 3'''\n''Parting at Bethany.'' Two tableaux presage the action.  In the first, the young Tobias departs from his parents while the angel Raphael, played by another boy, waits, crook in hand, stage left.  In the second, the loving bridesmaid from the [[Song of Solomon]] laments the loss of her groom.  In the play, Christ is anointed by [[Mary Magdalene]], then takes leave of his mother and friends.  Judas is angered by the waste of the spikenard oil.\n\n'''Act 4'''\n''The Last Journey to Jerusalem.'' A controversial tableau (now deleted) showed [[Queen Vashti]] dishonored at the court of King [[Ahasuerus]].  The old queen (Judaism, explains the Prologue) has been displaced by [[Esther]] (Christianity). Jesus sends two disciples to secure a [[Passover sacrifice|Paschal lamb]].  He enters Jerusalem for the last time and weeps over the fate of the city.  Judas contemplates betraying his master and is tempted by Dathan and other merchants.\n\n'''Act 5'''\n''[[The Last Supper]].'' The [[Passover Seder]] or Last Supper is celebrated in a scene evocative of the famous [[Da Vinci]] painting.  Jesus washes the feet of his disciples and institutes the mass with wine and thick, brown, leavened bread.  Two tableaux show [[Moses]] with rays or horns protruding from his head, bringing manna and grapes to the people in the wilderness.\n\n'''Act 6'''\n''The Betrayer.'' In a tableau, Joseph, a boy nude to the waist, is sold by his brothers to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver.  In accompanying action, Judas appears before the Sanhedrin and promises to deliver Jesus for [[thirty pieces of silver]].  After his departure, the [[Pharisees]] plan at great length the death of Jesus.\n\n'''Act 7'''\n''Jesus at the [[Mount of Olives]].'' Two more Old Testament scenes introduce the soliloquy of Jesus in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].  The first, a non-sequitur, which we are told explains that man must earn his food by the sweat of his brow, shows Adam, in sheepskin and assisted by a brood of similarly attired children, drawing a plow across a field.  The second frieze more appropriately offers a helmeted Joab, surrounded by soldiers stabbing an unsuspecting Amasa in the ribs.  Christ agonizes over his fate while his apostles doze.  Judas enters with an armed band and betrays Jesus with a kiss.\n\n'''Act 8'''\n''Jesus before [[Annas]].''  The Old Testament parallel has Micah slapped on the cheek by Zedekiah, priest of Baal, for daring to predict King Ahab would die in battle.  In like manner, Jesus is taken before a waiting, eager Annas and is struck on the face for his insolence.  Soldiers also deride Christ as he is led though the streets by a rope.\n\n'''Act 9'''\n''Condemned by the High Council.'' Two more tableaux emphasize the humiliation of Christ.  In one, the aged Naboth is condemned by false witnesses and is stoned to death by the sons of Jezebel.  In the other, Job, sitting on a dunghill is railed at by his friends, servants, even his wife and children.  Meanwhile, Jesus is questioned by [[Caiaphas]] about his [[messiah]]-ship and is condemned.  A tortured Judas tries to get the Sanhedrin to repeal its verdict.  When his efforts prove unsuccessful, he tosses the money back at them and storms off.\n\n'''Act 10'''\n''Despair of Judas.'' Judas and all who identify with him are linked with Cain in the opening tableau.  The battered body of Abel appears at center stage.  To the right is Cain, clad in a leopard skin and holding a club in one hand.  His other hand is at his brow, attempting to conceal the brand of God.  In this short act Judas offers a speech of remorse then hangs himself.\n\n'''Act 11'''\n''Christ before [[Pilate]].'' Originally there was a frieze which heralded Christ's first appearance before Pilate.  The tableau of Daniel in the great pillared hall of Darius was deleted from later twentieth-century productions.  Pilate's interrogation, coupled with news of his wife's dream, convinces the governor that Jesus should be prosecuted by [[Herod Antipas]] for lese majesty.\n\n'''Act 12'''\n''Christ Before Herod.'' The scene stands without the original living picture which showed a blinded [[Samson]] mocked by the [[Philistines]].  Herod treats Christ with scorn, demanding a miracle, then sends him back to Pilate, cloaked in a red mantle of royalty.  Responding to the urging of the Sanhedrin, Pilate reluctantly agrees to have Jesus scourged.  [[Classical Rome|Roman]] guards beat Jesus and press a [[crown of thorns]] into his scalp.\n\n'''Act 13'''\n''Christ Sentenced to Death on the Cross.'' Two graphic pictures showing the presentation of Joseph's bloodied coat to Jacob, and [[Abraham]] about to stab Isaac on [[Moriah|Mt. Moriah]] have been rejected from contemporary versions of the Passion.  Retained, however, are tableaux which show Joseph riding a sedan chair as vizir of Egypt and another which supposedly represents the scapegoat offering of [[Yom Kippur]].  Following the tableaux, the stage is swarming with action as priests and Pharisees bring mobs from every direction.  Pilate gives Jesus another hearing then offers the people a choice between Jesus and [[Barabbas]].  They demand and receive a final judgement on Christ.\n\n'''Act 14'''\n''[[The Way of the Cross]].'' The final segment of the Passion is introduced by a more sublime image of the ''[[Akedah]],'' or binding of Isaac.  In this tableau, the boy, like Jesus, carries wood on his back as he and Abraham climb Mt. Moriah.  Another frieze, showing Moses and a bronze serpent intertwined about the cross has been deleted.  When the chorus withdraws from the stage Christ bears his cross to [[Golgotha]].  As he passes through the streets he encounters his mother, Veronica, and [[Simon of Cyrene]].  The women of Jerusalem weep for him.\n\n'''Act 15'''\n''Jesus on [[Calvary]].'' For the first time the chorus appears in black traditional mourning garb.  There is no tableau.  He is mocked by members of the Sanhedrin and the soldiers and utters his last words.  The legs of the criminals are broken.  A soldier pierces the side of Christ with a lance and blood gushes forth.  Jesus' followers slowly and reverently take down the body and lay it before his mother in a replica of the [[Pieta]].  The Sanhedrin insists that guards be posted before the tomb which is to hold Christ's body.\n\n'''Act 16'''\n''[[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and [[Apotheosis]].'' For the first time, action precedes a tableau.  Roman guards see a light at the tomb.  Mary Magdalene and the other women encounter an angel and recite the same lines as ''[[Quem Quaeritis]].''  The final tableau shows Jesus resplendent in white with his apostles, angels, the Virgin Mary, and Moses.  The Passion ends with a proclamation by the chorus.<ref name=Friedman/>\n\n==Length and frequency==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nThe Oberammergau production takes place in one day,<ref name=Moses>{{cite book|last=Moses|first=Montrose J.|title=The Passion Play of Oberammergau| year=1930|publisher=The Cornwall Press|location=Cornwall, NY}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} but the running time has varied due to the many revisions that have taken place through the years.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2010 it had a running time of 5 hours, beginning at 2:30 pm and ending at 10:00 pm, with a meal break.

By the middle of the 18th century it was obvious that the graveyard was also too small and a new venue was found on a field close by; however, the stage had to be specially built every year of the Play.\n\nThe first permanent stage seems to have been built in 1815 to a design by the then-local parish priest. In 1830 he was asked to help build a new, larger stage on the site of the present theatre. When it rained the audience got wet: umbrellas would have obscured the view of people sitting behind them.\n\nHowever, in 1890 a new, purpose-built theatre was built and, apart from some of the scenes on the side of the stage, it would have looked much as it does today. It was ready in time for the 1900 performance, with the six-arched hall capable of holding over 4000 spectators.\n\nThe theatre was enlarged in time for the 1930 and 1934 seasons and whilst it was considered ugly and uncomfortable it was praised for its superb acoustics and sight of the stage.\n\nFollowing the 1990 production both the interior and fa\u00e7ade of the theatre were renovated and the stage mechanics modernised.\n\nIt has now been transformed - new more comfortable seating has been installed along with under-floor heating; cloakrooms have been extended; the foyer made accessible for wheelchair users; exhibition areas added; safety and toilet facilities improved.\n\nToday the theatre can seat an audience of over 4700.\n\n==Antisemitism==\nPrevious versions of the play were [[Anti-Semitism#Passion plays|anti-Semitic]] in character, blaming the Jews for the \"murder\" of Christ.<ref name=Shapiro/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}  [[Adolf Hitler]] indicated, according to [[Abe Foxman]], approval of these allegedly anti-Semitic elements in the ''Oberammergau Passion Play''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Passion problems |date=2004-03-04 |first=Abraham H. |last=Foxman |journal=National Review}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 review in the Jewish newspaper \"[[The Forward]]\" stated: \"It is undeniably true that the play was virulently antisemitic through most of its history, and that it gained an extra dose of notoriety after Hitler endorsed the 1934 production.\"<ref name=Goldmann>Goldmann, A. J. [http://www.forward.com/articles/128345/ \"New Kind of Passion in an \u2018Alpine Jerusalem\u2019, Letter From Oberammergau\"], ''The Forward'', May 26, 2010, issue of June 4, 2010</ref> The review noted that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) states that the play \"continues to transmit negative stereotypes of Jews\" and that even the Catholic Church demanded changes to the play, to bring it more in line with church policies expressed by the [[Second Vatican Council]], 1962\u20131965, in the Apostolic Constitution, ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', 4, October 28, 1965 (\"[T]he Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God as if this followed from Sacred Scripture\"). In the 1970s, Oberammergau invited representatives from Jewish organizations to revise the play, and revisions were approved by a Christian theological advisor.<ref name=Goldmann/> 2000 and 2010 director Christian St\u00fcckl told \"The Forward\" that Jesus \"lived as a Jew.\" Therefore, in the revised play, Jesus and his disciples pray in Hebrew. After viewing the play, the reviewer was sympathetic to its artistry and felt less offended by its message than by \"Wagner\u2019s antisemitic caricatures and religious mysticism\".<ref name=Goldmann/> Nonetheless, the review quoted a report from the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations, which reviewed the 2010 script and objected that the play still makes use of \"elements that are historically dubious\" from the Gospels. The review stated that \"It seems unfair\" to accuse the play of anti-semitism when it recounts material in Christianity\u2019s sacred texts and noted that the ADL's national director Abe Foxman had said that if the play is \"about a Crucifixion in which the Jews kill Christ, you can never clean it up enough\" to avoid an anti-semitic message.<ref name=Goldmann/>\n\nIn 2010, there was a new production directed by Oberammergau native Christian St\u00fcckl, director at Munich's Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier and music director Markus Zwink and conductor Michael Bocklet - all from Oberammergau. The play started each day at 14.30 and including a three-hour supper interval ended at 22.30. This was an innovation, since previous productions had been performed in the morning and afternoon with a break for lunch. \n\nThe changes to the play since World War II have included the manner in which the play presents the charge of [[deicide]], collective guilt, [[supersessionism]] and typology, as well as the following:\n\n*the role of the Temple traders has been reduced;\n*the character \"Rabbi\" has been eliminated and his lines given to another character;\n*Jewish priests no longer wear horn-shaped hats;\n*Jesus has been addressed as Rabbi Yeshua;\n*Jesus and others speak fragments of Hebrew prayers in the play;\n*Jews are shown disputing with others about theological aspects of Judaism, not just about Jesus;\n*Pilate has been made to appear more tyrannical and threatens Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest, and it is made clear that Caiaphas does not speak for all the Jews;\n*Romans now stand guard at the gates when Jesus makes his entrance to Jerusalem;\n*Jesus' supporters have been added to the screaming crowd outside Pilate's palace;\n*Judas is portrayed as being duped into betraying Jesus;\n*removing the line \"His blood is upon us and also upon our children's children\" (from [[Matthew 27:25]]), and \"[[Ecce homo]]\" (Behold [only] a man);\n*[[Saint Peter|Peter]], when questioned by Nathaniel regarding abandoning [[Judaism]] replies, \"No! We don't want that! Far be it from us to abandon [[Moses]] and his law\"; and\n*at the [[Last Supper]] Jesus recites the blessing over the wine in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=Shapiro/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}<ref name=Goldmann/>\n\n===Nazi exploitation of the 1934 jubilee season===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}\nThe special jubilee season of the ''Oberammergau Passion Play'' in 1934, marking the 300th anniversary of the original vow to stage the play every ten years thereafter, was the first and only performance after the Nazi regime's rise to power the previous year. Among other things, the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] ordered the official poster for the jubilee season amended to include the message \"Deutschland ruft dich!\" (\"Germany is calling you!\"), and the ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' scheme's discount-travel programme offered special cut-rate packages for the Passion Play, including train fare, tickets and accommodations.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nOfficial propaganda described the Passion Play as \"peasant drama ... inspired by the consecrating power of the soil\", and Hitler attended a performance. An attempt to rewrite the Passion Play script to bring it into line with Nazi ideology was rejected, however, by the more conservative element.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Papal protective measures to ensure soundness of doctrine===\nMissio Canonica is a canonical certification necessary for preaching. In 19th-century Germany it was extended to teaching as well. In 1922 the Catholic Church gave the play a ''[[Missio Canonica]]''. It is a certification that the beliefs of the Catholic Church are being taught or, in this case, being presented.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Liturgical drama]]\n*[[Medieval theatre]]\n*[[Mystery Play of Elche]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Scripts==\n* Joseph Alois Daisenberger: {{Google books|8FwZAAAAYAAJ|Complete official text of the Oberammergau passion-play.
