Set in modern times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], a demon hunter who uses his business to get his revenge on the demons after losing his brother and mother. He meets a woman named [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Trish|Trish]] who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]]. The story is told primarily through a mixture of [[cutscene]]s, which use the [[game engine]] and several [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[full motion video]]s. The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by the use of allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante (named after [[Dante Alighieri]]) and other characters like Trish ([[Beatrice Portinari]]) and Vergil ([[Virgil]]).<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624224635/http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 24, 2013 |title=Postmortem on DMC3:SE |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |author=Mielke, James }}</ref>\n\nThe game was originally conceived in 1999 as ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. Due to the staff feeling it would not fit the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise, the project dropped its ties to ''Resident Evil'' and was made into its own story instead. ''Devil May Cry'' received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact it had in the action game genre, its high difficulty and the high overall scores given to it by professional reviewers. The game has sold more than three million copies,<ref name=\"devilmaycry\">{{cite web|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=4737 |title=Matt\u2019s Somewhat Serious Bit |accessdate=2008-07-20 |date=2006-06-09 |author=Matt Keller |publisher=Palgn |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513183309/http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=4737 |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref> and spawned multiple sequels and a prequel.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay consists of levels called \"missions\", where players must fight numerous enemies, perform [[Platform game|platforming]] tasks, and occasionally solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade D increasing to C, B, and A with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of \"red orbs\" gathered (the in-game currency obtained from defeated enemies), how \"stylish\" their combat was, item usage, and damage taken.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher = [[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Dante attacks an enemy using the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" qualifies the player's performance in combat.]]\n\"Stylish\" combat is defined as performing an unbroken series of varied attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at \"Dull\"; progresses through \"Cool\", \"Bravo\", and \"Absolute\"; and peaks at \"Stylish\". Repeatedly using the same moves causes the gauge to stop rising, forcing the player to use every move in their arsenal. The gauge terms are similar to the grades given at the end of the missions. When Dante receives damage, the style rating resets back to \"Dull\". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe player can temporarily transform Dante into a more powerful demonic creature by using the \"Devil Trigger\" ability. Doing so adds powers based on the current weapon and changes Dante's appearance. The transformations typically increase strength and defense, slowly restore health, and grant special attacks. It is governed by the Devil Trigger gauge, which depletes as the ability is used, and is refilled by attacking enemies or taunting in normal form.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\n''Devil May Cry'' contains puzzles and other challenges besides regular combat gameplay. The main storyline often requires the player to find key items to advance, in a manner similar to puzzles in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games, as well as optional platforming and exploration tasks to find hidden caches of \"orbs\". [[Quest (video gaming)|Side quests]], called \"Secret Missions\" in the game, are located in hidden or out-of-the-way areas and are not required for completion, but provide permanent [[power-up]]s. They typically challenge the player to defeat a group of enemies in a specific manner or within a time limit.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Devil May Cry chronology}}\n{{See also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}\n\n''Devil May Cry'' begins with Dante being attacked in his office by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother.<ref>'''Dante:''' Well the way I figure it, in this business a lot of your kind come along, and if I kill each one that comes, eventually I should hit the jackpot sooner or later. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds responsible for the deaths of his family, is planning a return.<ref>'''Trish:''' Yes, his powers were sealed by Sparda, he's attempting to take control of the human world again. He has been preparing to open the gate on... Mallet Island. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense [[castle]] on Mallet Island, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.\n\nDante explores the castle and encounters the game's stock enemies, demonic marionettes. He also finds a new sword called Alastor, and battles the first [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], a giant [[spider]]/[[scorpion]] demon named Phantom. Dante wins the battle, but in what becomes a recurring theme, the defeated boss monster reappears a short time later in a corridor, forcing Dante to choose a narrow escape or to fight in the tight confines. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named Nelo Angelo who impresses Dante with his confidence.<ref>'''Dante:''' This stinking hole was the last place that I thought I'd find anyone with some guts. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante manages to defeat Nelo Angelo and is about to deliver the final blow - but unfortunately, Nelo Angelo evades him, and counterattacks Dante furiously with a series of punches and kicks. The demon prepares to kill Dante but suddenly flees upon seeing the half-[[amulet]] Dante wears, which contains a picture of his mother. The demon attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's [[Twin#Semi-identical twins|identical twin]] brother, [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]]. After Angelo/Vergil's death, his amulet joins with his brother's half, and \"Force Edge\", the game's default sword, which had belonged to the twins' father, changes into its true form and becomes the [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Sparda|Sparda]] sword.\n\nWhen Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him and reveals that she too is working for Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her resemblance to his [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Eva|mother]], he warns her to stay away.<ref>'''Trish:''' Uh&nbsp;... Dante! Dante, why did you save my life? '''Dante:''' Because you look like my mother&nbsp;... Now get out of my sight! The next time we meet it won't be like this. '''Trish:''' Dante! '''Dante:''' Don't come any closer, you Devil! You may look like my mother but you're nowhere close to her. You have no soul! You have the face but you'll never have her fire! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, who is about to kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda.<ref>'''Dante:''' How much longer are you going to keep zapping? Come out and show yourself, Mundus! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.\n\nDante is victorious, and leaves the amulet and sword with Trish's immobile body before departing.<ref>'''Dante:''' This was my mother's. Now I'm giving it to you. My father's also here now. Rest&nbsp;... in Peace. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Returning to the Human World, Dante finds that the island is collapsing, and is cornered by the injured Mundus, who has followed him back to the Human World. Dante fights Mundus, now back to his regular strength, when Trish also returns and lends Dante her power. Dante defeats Mundus, who vows to return and rule the human world.<ref>'''Trish:''' Dante, use my power! '''Dante:''' Trish! Okay! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> When Trish tries to apologize she begins to cry, and Dante tells her it means she has become human and not just a devil, because \"devils never cry\".<ref>'''Dante:''' Trish...devils never cry&nbsp;... These tears, tears are a gift only humans have. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Trish escape on a plane as the island collapses. After the credits, it is revealed that Dante and Trish are working together as partners, and have renamed the shop \"Devil Never Cry\".\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Resident Evil 4#Development|l1=Resident Evil 4: Development}}\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] (pictured).]]\nFirst hinted at in early December 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/072/072895p1.html |title=Resident Evil Series to Haunt PlayStation 2 |author=Douglass C.

Set in modern times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], a demon hunter who uses his business to get his revenge on the demons after losing his brother and mother. He meets a woman named [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Trish|Trish]] who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]]. The story is told primarily through a mixture of [[cutscene]]s, which use the [[game engine]] and several [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[full motion video]]s. The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by the use of allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante (named after [[Dante Alighieri]]) and other characters like Trish ([[Beatrice Portinari]]) and Vergil ([[Virgil]]).<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624224635/http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 24, 2013 |title=Postmortem on DMC3:SE |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |author=Mielke, James }}</ref>\n\nThe game was originally conceived in 1999 as ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. Due to the staff feeling it would not fit the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise, the project dropped its ties to ''Resident Evil'' and was made into its own story instead. ''Devil May Cry'' received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact it had in the action game genre, its high difficulty and the high overall scores given to it by professional reviewers. The game has sold more than three million copies,<ref name=\"devilmaycry\">{{cite web|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=4737 |title=Matt\u2019s Somewhat Serious Bit |accessdate=2008-07-20 |date=2006-06-09 |author=Matt Keller |publisher=Palgn |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513183309/http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=4737 |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref> and spawned multiple sequels and a prequel.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay consists of levels called \"missions\", where players must fight numerous enemies, perform [[Platform game|platforming]] tasks, and occasionally solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade D increasing to C, B, and A with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of \"red orbs\" gathered (the in-game currency obtained from defeated enemies), how \"stylish\" their combat was, item usage, and damage taken.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher = [[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Dante attacks an enemy using the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" qualifies the player's performance in combat.]]\n\"Stylish\" combat is defined as performing an unbroken series of varied attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at \"Dull\"; progresses through \"Cool\", \"Bravo\", and \"Absolute\"; and peaks at \"Stylish\". Repeatedly using the same moves causes the gauge to stop rising, forcing the player to use every move in their arsenal. The gauge terms are similar to the grades given at the end of the missions. When Dante receives damage, the style rating resets back to \"Dull\". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe player can temporarily transform Dante into a more powerful demonic creature by using the \"Devil Trigger\" ability. Doing so adds powers based on the current weapon and changes Dante's appearance. The transformations typically increase strength and defense, slowly restore health, and grant special attacks. It is governed by the Devil Trigger gauge, which depletes as the ability is used, and is refilled by attacking enemies or taunting in normal form.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\n''Devil May Cry'' contains puzzles and other challenges besides regular combat gameplay. The main storyline often requires the player to find key items to advance, in a manner similar to puzzles in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games, as well as optional platforming and exploration tasks to find hidden caches of \"orbs\". [[Quest (video gaming)|Side quests]], called \"Secret Missions\" in the game, are located in hidden or out-of-the-way areas and are not required for completion, but provide permanent [[power-up]]s. They typically challenge the player to defeat a group of enemies in a specific manner or within a time limit.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Devil May Cry chronology}}\n{{See also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}\n\n''Devil May Cry'' begins with Dante being attacked in his office by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother.<ref>'''Dante:''' Well the way I figure it, in this business a lot of your kind come along, and if I kill each one that comes, eventually I should hit the jackpot sooner or later. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds responsible for the deaths of his family, is planning a return.<ref>'''Trish:''' Yes, his powers were sealed by Sparda, he's attempting to take control of the human world again. He has been preparing to open the gate on... Mallet Island. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense [[castle]] on Mallet Island, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.\n\nDante explores the castle and encounters the game's stock enemies, demonic marionettes. He also finds a new sword called Alastor, and battles the first [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], a giant [[spider]]/[[scorpion]] demon named Phantom. Dante wins the battle, but in what becomes a recurring theme, the defeated boss monster reappears a short time later in a corridor, forcing Dante to choose a narrow escape or to fight in the tight confines. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named Nelo Angelo who impresses Dante with his confidence.<ref>'''Dante:''' This stinking hole was the last place that I thought I'd find anyone with some guts. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante manages to defeat Nelo Angelo and is about to deliver the final blow - but unfortunately, Nelo Angelo evades him, and counterattacks Dante furiously with a series of punches and kicks. The demon prepares to kill Dante but suddenly flees upon seeing the half-[[amulet]] Dante wears, which contains a picture of his mother. The demon attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's [[Twin#Semi-identical twins|identical twin]] brother, [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]]. After Angelo/Vergil's death, his amulet joins with his brother's half, and \"Force Edge\", the game's default sword, which had belonged to the twins' father, changes into its true form and becomes the [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Sparda|Sparda]] sword.\n\nWhen Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him and reveals that she too is working for Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her resemblance to his [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Eva|mother]], he warns her to stay away.<ref>'''Trish:''' Uh&nbsp;... Dante! Dante, why did you save my life? '''Dante:''' Because you look like my mother&nbsp;... Now get out of my sight! The next time we meet it won't be like this. '''Trish:''' Dante! '''Dante:''' Don't come any closer, you Devil! You may look like my mother but you're nowhere close to her. You have no soul! You have the face but you'll never have her fire! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, who is about to kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda.<ref>'''Dante:''' How much longer are you going to keep zapping? Come out and show yourself, Mundus! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.\n\nDante is victorious, and leaves the amulet and sword with Trish's immobile body before departing.<ref>'''Dante:''' This was my mother's. Now I'm giving it to you. My father's also here now. Rest&nbsp;... in Peace. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Returning to the Human World, Dante finds that the island is collapsing, and is cornered by the injured Mundus, who has followed him back to the Human World. Dante fights Mundus, now back to his regular strength, when Trish also returns and lends Dante her power. Dante defeats Mundus, who vows to return and rule the human world.<ref>'''Trish:''' Dante, use my power! '''Dante:''' Trish! Okay! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> When Trish tries to apologize she begins to cry, and Dante tells her it means she has become human and not just a devil, because \"devils never cry\".<ref>'''Dante:''' Trish...devils never cry&nbsp;... These tears, tears are a gift only humans have. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Trish escape on a plane as the island collapses. After the credits, it is revealed that Dante and Trish are working together as partners, and have renamed the shop \"Devil Never Cry\".\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Resident Evil 4#Development|l1=Resident Evil 4: Development}}\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] (pictured).]]\nFirst hinted at in early December 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/072/072895p1.html |title=Resident Evil Series to Haunt PlayStation 2 |author=Douglass C.

Set in New York, the plot involves the interaction between two women \u2013 a bored housewife and a bohemian drifter \u2013 linked by various messages in the personal column of a newspaper.\n\nThe film was Madonna's first major screen role and also provided early roles for a number of other well-known performers, such as [[John Turturro]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Aidan Quinn]], and [[Steven Wright]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' named it one of the ten best films of 1985.\n\n== Plot ==\nRoberta, an unfulfilled housewife in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], is fascinated by messages between lovers Susan and Jim in the [[Personal advertisement|personals section]] of a [[New York City]] tabloid, particularly an ad from Jim with the headline \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d, seeking a rendezvous in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]].\n\nIn an [[Atlantic City]] hotel, the itinerant Susan reads the ad after a tryst with mobster Meeker. She steals a pair of ornate [[Egypt]]ian earrings from his coat before departing; the sinister Nolan notices Susan's embellished [[tuxedo]] jacket as she leaves. Arriving in New York City, Susan dons one of the earrings, stashing the other in her suitcase in a [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] locker. She asks to stay with her friend Crystal, a magician's assistant at the Magic Club, and learns Meeker was killed at the hotel.\n\nHoping to spot the lovers, Roberta goes to Battery Park and sees Jim reunite with Susan before leaving with his band for [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Roberta follows Susan to a vintage store, watching her trade in her jacket before losing sight of her, and buys the jacket. Finding Susan's locker key, she posts another \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d ad to meet with her to return it. Concerned about the ad and Susan's connection to Meeker's death, Jim asks his friend Dez to check on her.\n\nWaiting for Susan at Battery Park and wearing her jacket, Roberta is accosted by Nolan, mistaking her for Susan. Susan spots Roberta, but is arrested for not paying her cab fare. Dez arrives and rescues Roberta, who hits her head and loses her memory. Also mistaking Roberta for Susan, Dez takes her to the Port Authority to collect Susan's suitcase, finding the other earring, and lets her stay at his apartment.\n\nRoberta, believing she must be Susan, retraces Susan's steps with Nolan in pursuit. She arrives at the Magic Club \u2013 narrowly missing Susan, who has been released from jail and discovered her suitcase gone \u2013 and is hired as Crystal's replacement. After Roberta's disastrous first performance, Nolan attacks her, demanding the earrings, but he escapes as the police arrive. Roberta hits her head again, regaining her memory, but is mistaken for a prostitute and arrested.\n\nSearching for Roberta, her husband Gary finds his way to the vintage store and is put in touch with Susan, who believes Roberta and Dez are connected to Meeker's death and want to frame her. Susan accompanies Gary home, where they get high. Roberta calls from jail, but hangs up when Susan and Gary answer. After calling Dez to bail her out, they find his apartment ransacked by Nolan, and sleep together.\n\nAt Gary's house, Susan sees a TV report about Meeker and Nolan having stolen the earrings, once belonging to [[Nefertiti]]. She realizes the truth from Roberta's diary, and posts an ad to meet her at the Magic Club. Dez attacks an intruder in his apartment who turns out to be Jim, and confesses to his relationship with \u201cSusan\u201d as Roberta slips away. She reads the ad, as do Jim and Dez; they arrive at the Magic Club, along with Gary, his sister Leslie, and Nolan.\n\nDuring her act, Roberta recognizes Nolan, who flees backstage. Dez leaves as Roberta tries to explain the events of her disappearance to Gary, finally voicing her unhappiness and ending their marriage. Nolan threatens Susan at gunpoint, but is knocked out by Roberta.\n\nLater, Roberta finds Dez at work in a theater projection booth. She \u201cintroduces\u201d herself and they kiss, as Jim and Susan reunite in the theater below. A final newspaper headline reveals that Roberta and Susan returned the earrings.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Roberta Glass\n* [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as Susan Thomas\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Dez\n* [[Mark Blum]] as Gary Glass, Roberta's husband\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Jim Dandy, Susan's boyfriend\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Leslie Glass, Roberta's sister-in-law\n* [[Anna Thomson|Anna Levine]] as Crystal\n* [[Will Patton]] as Wayne Nolan\n* [[Peter Maloney (actor)|Peter Maloney]] as Ian the magician\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Larry Stillman D.D.S.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Ray, the master of ceremonies at the Magic Club\n* [[Anne Carlisle]] as Victoria\n* Jos\u00e9 Angel Santana as Boutique Owner\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Street Vendor\n* [[Richard Hell]] as Bruce Meeker\n* [[Rockets Redglare]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Annie Golden]] as Band Singer\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Man with Newspapers\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Cigarette Girl\n* [[John Lurie]] as Neighbor Saxophonist\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Sgt.

[[Bruce Willis]] was up for the role of Dez and [[Melanie Griffith]] was up for the part of Susan. Madonna barely beat out [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] for the part. [[Suzanne Vega]] also auditioned for the role.\n\nThe [[Statue of Liberty]] can be seen in the film when it was still covered in scaffolding during its two-year renovation. Costume designer [[Santo Loquasto]] designed Susan's distinctive jacket (supposedly first worn by [[Jimi Hendrix]]), basis of the plot of mistaken identity.\n\nThe film was inspired in part by the 1974 film ''[[Celine and Julie Go Boating|C\u00e9line et Julie vont en bateau]]'' (''C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating'').<ref>{{cite book|first=Guy|last=Austin|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Bbxa3q3ZZAC&pg=PA64&dq=C%C3%A9line+et+Julie+vont+en+bateau|title=Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction By Guy Austin|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=New York City|edition=2nd|ISBN=0-7190-4610-6|page=64|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> It also has an alternate ending included on the DVD, in which Susan and Roberta are invited to Egypt after helping return the earrings. They are depicted next to the [[Pyramids of Egypt|pyramids]] on camels. Seidelman cut this scene, saying that it was unnecessary and audiences at the test screenings thought the film should have already ended much earlier (as explained on the DVD). The 1964 science fiction film ''[[The Time Travelers (1964 film)|The Time Travelers]]'' is playing in scenes 6 and 23 (melts at the end of the movie). All the scenes featuring Dez working as a projectionist were filmed at [[Bleecker Street Cinema]]. The scene with Roberta and Gary in their kitchen shows Roberta watching [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''.\n\nThe movie was filmed during the late summer and early fall of 1984, early in Madonna's rise to popularity, and was intended to be an [[Motion picture rating system|R-rated]] feature. After the success of her 1984\u201385 hits \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\" and \"[[Material Girl]]\" from her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album, the film was trimmed in content by [[Orion Pictures]] to get a PG-13 rating in order to also market the film to Madonna's teenage fan base.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybUBAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA111&dq=%22desperately%20seeking%20susan%22|title=Brief Reviews|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York Media|date=May 27, 1985|page=111}}</ref>\n\nThe interior/exterior shots of The Magic Club were filmed at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peyser|first1=Michael|title=Desperately Seeking Susan 25: Sarah Pillsbury & Michael Peyser on the Magic Club|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIglclqwVm0|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Some scenes were filmed at [[Danceteria]], a club that Madonna frequented and which gave her a start in the music business.\n\nSeparated-at-birth triplets [[Three Identical Strangers|Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland, and David Kellman]] have a cameo role, reportedly at Madonna's personal invitation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Sara|title=These Triplets Were Separated at Birth for a Sick Scientific Experiment|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/these-triplets-were-separated-at-birth-for-a-sick-scientific-experiment/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was released on both vinyl and CD together with the soundtrack to the film ''[[Making Mr. Right]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Thomas-Newman-Chaz-Jankel-Desperately-Seeking-Susan-Making-Mr-Right-The-Films-Of-Susan-Seidelman-Ori/release/11691870|website=Discogs|title= Thomas Newman / Chaz Jankel* \u2013 Desperately Seeking Susan / Making Mr. Right (The Films of Susan Seidelman: Original Motion Picture Soundtracks) }}</ref> The soundtrack does not feature any of the other songs in the film including Madonna's \"[[Into the Groove]],\" which can be found on the European 1985 re-release of her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album. The film captures the feel of the underground Bohemian/[[New wave music|new wave]] scene of the early to mid-1980s New York City, a scene that helped Madonna get her big break in the music business. Madonna recorded a song for the movie, titled \"Desperately Seeking Susan.\" It ended up not being used in the film, and a demo she just finished at the time called \"Into the Groove\" was used instead. The demo version can only be heard in the movie. The song was a huge commercial success but was not included on the film's soundtrack, despite being heard in the film, because licensing restrictions involving Madonna's record label prohibited her songs from being mixed in with other artists. The video for \"Into the Groove\" consists of clips from the film compiled by Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions.\n\n=== Track listing ===\n'''Desperately Seeking Susan'''\n{{tracklist\n| all_music = [[Thomas Newman]]\n| title1    = Leave Atlantic City!\n| length1   = 2:33\n| title2    = Port Authority by Night\n| length2   = 1:14\n| title3    = New York City by Day\n| length3   = 1:06\n| title4    = Through the Viewscope\n| length4   = 0:40\n| title5    = St. Mark's Place\n| length5   = 1:30\n| title6    = A Key and a Picture Of\n| length6   = 1:22\n| title7    = Battery Park / Amnesia\n| length7   = 1:06\n| title8    = Jail / Port Authority by Day\n| length8   = 2:22\n| title9    = Rain\n| length9   = 0:51\n| title10   = Running With Birds in Cages\n| length10  = 1:11\n| title11   = Trouble Almost\n| length11  = 0:43\n}}\n\n'''Making Mr. Right'''\n{{tracklist\n| all_music = [[Chaz Jankel]]\n| title1    = Chemtech Promo Video\n| length1   = 1:52\n| title2    = Ulysses' Escape\n| length2   = 3:00\n| title3    = Night Visit\n| length3   = 1:00\n| title4    = Frankie's Drive\n| length4   = 1:05\n| title5    = Ulysses\n| length5   = 1:41\n| title6    = In the Lab\n| length6   = 1:15\n| title7    = Sondra and Jeff\n| length7   = 0:57\n| title8    = Mr. Right\n| length8   = 1:28\n| title9    = Wedding Reception\n| length9   = 1:56\n| title10   = Parting Glance\n| length10  = 1:09\n}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn her review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[Pauline Kael]] referred to Madonna as \"an indolent, trampy goddess.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Amis|date=May 2, 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umhoFsnYri8C&pg=PT290&dq=Pauline+Kael,+indolent,+trampy+goddess|title=Visiting Mrs. Nabokov: And Other Excursions|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0679757931|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=J.

Costume designer [[Santo Loquasto]] designed Susan's distinctive jacket (supposedly first worn by [[Jimi Hendrix]]), basis of the plot of mistaken identity.\n\nThe film was inspired in part by the 1974 film ''[[Celine and Julie Go Boating|C\u00e9line et Julie vont en bateau]]'' (''C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating'').<ref>{{cite book|first=Guy|last=Austin|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Bbxa3q3ZZAC&pg=PA64&dq=C%C3%A9line+et+Julie+vont+en+bateau|title=Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction By Guy Austin|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=New York City|edition=2nd|ISBN=0-7190-4610-6|page=64|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> It also has an alternate ending included on the DVD, in which Susan and Roberta are invited to Egypt after helping return the earrings. They are depicted next to the [[Pyramids of Egypt|pyramids]] on camels. Seidelman cut this scene, saying that it was unnecessary and audiences at the test screenings thought the film should have already ended much earlier (as explained on the DVD). The 1964 science fiction film ''[[The Time Travelers (1964 film)|The Time Travelers]]'' is playing in scenes 6 and 23 (melts at the end of the movie). All the scenes featuring Dez working as a projectionist were filmed at [[Bleecker Street Cinema]]. The scene with Roberta and Gary in their kitchen shows Roberta watching [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''.\n\nThe movie was filmed during the late summer and early fall of 1984, early in Madonna's rise to popularity, and was intended to be an [[Motion picture rating system|R-rated]] feature. After the success of her 1984\u201385 hits \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\" and \"[[Material Girl]]\" from her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album, the film was trimmed in content by [[Orion Pictures]] to get a PG-13 rating in order to also market the film to Madonna's teenage fan base.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybUBAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA111&dq=%22desperately%20seeking%20susan%22|title=Brief Reviews|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York Media|date=May 27, 1985|page=111}}</ref>\n\nThe interior/exterior shots of The Magic Club were filmed at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peyser|first1=Michael|title=Desperately Seeking Susan 25: Sarah Pillsbury & Michael Peyser on the Magic Club|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIglclqwVm0|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Some scenes were filmed at [[Danceteria]], a club that Madonna frequented and which gave her a start in the music business.\n\nSeparated-at-birth triplets [[Three Identical Strangers|Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland, and David Kellman]] have a cameo role, reportedly at Madonna's personal invitation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Sara|title=These Triplets Were Separated at Birth for a Sick Scientific Experiment|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/these-triplets-were-separated-at-birth-for-a-sick-scientific-experiment/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was released on both vinyl and CD together with the soundtrack to the film ''[[Making Mr. Right]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Thomas-Newman-Chaz-Jankel-Desperately-Seeking-Susan-Making-Mr-Right-The-Films-Of-Susan-Seidelman-Ori/release/11691870|website=Discogs|title= Thomas Newman / Chaz Jankel* \u2013 Desperately Seeking Susan / Making Mr. Right (The Films of Susan Seidelman: Original Motion Picture Soundtracks) }}</ref> The soundtrack does not feature any of the other songs in the film including Madonna's \"[[Into the Groove]],\" which can be found on the European 1985 re-release of her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album. The film captures the feel of the underground Bohemian/[[New wave music|new wave]] scene of the early to mid-1980s New York City, a scene that helped Madonna get her big break in the music business. Madonna recorded a song for the movie, titled \"Desperately Seeking Susan.\" It ended up not being used in the film, and a demo she just finished at the time called \"Into the Groove\" was used instead. The demo version can only be heard in the movie. The song was a huge commercial success but was not included on the film's soundtrack, despite being heard in the film, because licensing restrictions involving Madonna's record label prohibited her songs from being mixed in with other artists. The video for \"Into the Groove\" consists of clips from the film compiled by Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions.\n\n=== Track listing ===\n'''Desperately Seeking Susan'''\n{{tracklist\n| all_music = [[Thomas Newman]]\n| title1    = Leave Atlantic City!\n| length1   = 2:33\n| title2    = Port Authority by Night\n| length2   = 1:14\n| title3    = New York City by Day\n| length3   = 1:06\n| title4    = Through the Viewscope\n| length4   = 0:40\n| title5    = St. Mark's Place\n| length5   = 1:30\n| title6    = A Key and a Picture Of\n| length6   = 1:22\n| title7    = Battery Park / Amnesia\n| length7   = 1:06\n| title8    = Jail / Port Authority by Day\n| length8   = 2:22\n| title9    = Rain\n| length9   = 0:51\n| title10   = Running With Birds in Cages\n| length10  = 1:11\n| title11   = Trouble Almost\n| length11  = 0:43\n}}\n\n'''Making Mr. Right'''\n{{tracklist\n| all_music = [[Chaz Jankel]]\n| title1    = Chemtech Promo Video\n| length1   = 1:52\n| title2    = Ulysses' Escape\n| length2   = 3:00\n| title3    = Night Visit\n| length3   = 1:00\n| title4    = Frankie's Drive\n| length4   = 1:05\n| title5    = Ulysses\n| length5   = 1:41\n| title6    = In the Lab\n| length6   = 1:15\n| title7    = Sondra and Jeff\n| length7   = 0:57\n| title8    = Mr. Right\n| length8   = 1:28\n| title9    = Wedding Reception\n| length9   = 1:56\n| title10   = Parting Glance\n| length10  = 1:09\n}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn her review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[Pauline Kael]] referred to Madonna as \"an indolent, trampy goddess.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Amis|date=May 2, 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umhoFsnYri8C&pg=PT290&dq=Pauline+Kael,+indolent,+trampy+goddess|title=Visiting Mrs. Nabokov: And Other Excursions|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0679757931|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=J.
