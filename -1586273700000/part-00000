{"title_page": "Cargo system", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=November 2017}}\n{{SpanishMissions}}\nThe '''cargo system''' (also known as the civil-religious hierarchy, ''fiesta'' or ''mayordom\u00eda'' system) is a collection of secular and religious positions held by men or households in rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] communities throughout central and southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].  These revolving offices, or ''cargos'', become the unpaid responsibility of men who are active in civic life.  They typically hold a given post for a term of one year, and alternate between civic and religious obligations from year to year.  Office holders execute most of the tasks of local governments and churches.  Individuals who hold a cargo are generally obligated to incur the costs of feasting during the ''fiestas'' that honor particular saints.\n\nWhere it is practiced, there is generally some expectation of all local men to take part in this cargo system throughout their lives.  Office holders assume greater responsibilities as they grow in stature in the community.  Such progression requires substantial financial resources, but eventually an individual who holds a requisite number of posts in service to his community retires and joins a group of elders instrumental in community decision-making, including appointing people to cargos.\n\nThis expectation of local men to take part in this system is both an economic and a social one, as those who do not contribute are seen as not being deserving of living in the village.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Sueann Caulfield|editor2=Sarah C.

Furthermore, the legal enforcement of village obligations solidified communal (social) identity, rather than an identity dependent upon and linked to the national state.

The cargo system was mainly defined as a public labor and community service. Villages that were impoverished were able to get help easier because taxes were not charged, yet public work was given. It was a system in which involved faithful and long term community service. Men and women (husband and wife) were considered one unit, men needed their wives in order to succeed in their community. Women did not claim rights in relation to village government.<ref>Caulfield, Sueann, et al. \u201cCommunity Service, Liberal Law and Local Custom in Indigenous Villages: Oaxaca, 1750-1850.\u201d Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 60\u201363.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe origins of the cargo system are tied to the efforts of [[Spain|Spanish]] missionaries to convert [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to Christianity while at the same time forestalling their cultural Hispanicization.  After the Spanish conquest of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 16th century, many Indians were forcibly relocated to [[pueblo]]s, which like Spanish villages contained a church as the town center.  Priests were one of many special interest foreigners who had control over the political and social affairs of indigenous peoples, and they had dominion over many of these pueblos and had the authority to keep other colonists out.  The priests were mindful that much of their influence over the Indians stemmed from the priests' ability to speak Indian languages.  Despite a 1550 royal edict calling for native peoples to be taught the Spanish language, missionaries continued to minister to them in [[Nahuatl]] and other local languages, thus preserving a major source of Indian dependency on the church.  The colonial church did not insist on excessive [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicization]] of existing indigenous practices, so long as there was no clear conflict between the two.\n\nBecause the missionaries were small in number, they increasingly placed religious responsibilities in the hands of trusted members of the villages.  The village mayor or ''alcalde'' was charged with the responsibility of leading the villagers in a procession to Sunday [[Catholic Mass|Mass]].  Over time, these processions were conducted with greater ceremony, making use of trappings such as crosses, incense, and music.\n\nThe cargo system was used and transformed by communities within the context of law to eliminate noble exemption privileges. This brought to an end many internal feuds over ''principales'' with regards to nobility. Noble exemptions were opposed by the common people, who were worried that such exemptions would negatively impact the supply of labour to the point of constant service. It was impossible to become part of the nobility by marrying the daughter of a noble, and was instead pushed by claimants based on heritage. Therefore, in practice, the system was not as egalitarian as in the hypothetical sense, because while some men could move to greater positions and into seats of authority, others lacked the prestige to accomplish the same. The dispersal of the ability to accumulate wealth along with prestige also contributed greatly to the transformation of these villages.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Sueann Caulfield|editor2=Sarah C.

Indigenous people filled these roles, which in theory gave them greater status within the community.  These roles, however, also placed economic obligations on their recipients and the clergy used them as a way to exercise control over the villagers.  Villagers were obligated to organize efforts to discharge debts related to cost of food, wafers and wine for the Mass and payment of the priests.\n\nThe cargo system could a serve a manner in which people could elevate their station in society. People who faithfully discharged their duties through a series of mundane tasks could increase their social status which resulted in greater access for job opportunities and loftier positions.  In short, community service allowed one to move up in the hierarchy of their society. Eventually villagers could reach a high ranking position as members of the principals, who in turn would vote for the communal leader, the gobernadores. The ''caciques'' ore pre-Hispanic nobles were exempt from the low standing positions, although a person from meager beginnings could ultimately serve to accumulate wealth and power.\n\nThe cargo system also affected marital life. The man would work in the household of his in-laws. After marriage, the wife would move in with the groom's family in which she served as a domestic servant for her mother-in law.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n*[[Potlatch]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==Sources==\n* Frank Cancian, Economics and prestige in a Maya community : the religious cargo system in Zinacantan.

In the mid-9th century, in response to the increasing frequency of [[Viking]] raids, the relics of Saint Reine (or Santa Regina) were removed from the nearby town of [[Alise-Sainte-Reine|Alise]] to Flavigny in the hopes that they could be better protected in a more fortified setting.  The relics remain in Flavigny to this day, although they travel back to Alise every autumn for the celebration of the saint's feast day in early September.\n\nThe town was prosperous during the Middle Ages, catering to large numbers of pilgrims, both those who came to visit the relics of Saint Reine and those on their way to [[Santiago de Compostela]].  By the 10th century, the abbey had grown into a town, with a parish church dedicated to St. Genest in addition to the abbey church (dedicated to St. Peter).  During the 12th and 13th centuries, extensive fortifications were raised around the town. Large sections of these walls still surround the village to this day, including the Porte du Val, which includes both an inner gate dating to the 13th century and a 16th-century outer gate, and the 15th-century Porte du Bourg, with a statue of the Virgin. Despite these fortifications, Flavigny was taken and occupied by the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]].\n\nIn 1632 the Ursuline convent of Flavigny was founded, and in the early 18th century a new residence for the Abbot of Flavigny was constructed. However, by that time the abbacy had become corrupt and was held by a layman who had little to do with the town.  At the time of the [[French Revolution]], there may have been as few as five monks in residence.  The abbey church was probably already in ruins, although local tradition holds that it suffered damage at the hands of revolutionaries.  The parish church, St. Genest, emerged from the Revolution more or less unharmed.\n\nIn the 21st century, Flavigny has fewer than 400 year-round residents, although this number increases in the summer due to the substantial number of foreigners (British, Swiss, American, Australian, German) who have summer homes in the village.  The abbey now houses the factory which manufactures [[Anis de Flavigny|Les Anis de Flavigny]], small aniseed-flavored pastilles distributed worldwide.

In the opinion of highly respected architect [[John Russell Pope]], there were only three New York firms whose carvings would be \u201cproperly done.\u201d They were Edward Ardolino, John Donnelly, and [[Piccirilli Brothers]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=236}} During this period Ardolino was awarded commissions for four federal buildings. All four reside within a designated historical district. \n\n* The [[Department of Commerce Building]], designed by architects [[York and Sawyer]], was constructed from 1927 to 1932. The modeling firm was Ricci and Zari. Ardolino\u2019s carvings include: the eagles along the cornice of the 14<sup>th</sup> Street fa\u00e7ade, the third floor keystones, four panels at each of four driveway entrances, and eight urns.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=83, 100, 103-104}}\n\n* The [[New Post Office Building|Department of the Post Office,]] later called the Federal Building, was designed by [[Delano and Aldrich]] and built between 1931 and 1934. Edward Ardolino company carved the metopes ([[Adolph Alexander Weinman]], sculptor) and keystones (modeled by Ricci Studios).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=126, 131, 146-147}} At the height of the Post office carving in 1933, Ardolino employed at least 36 carvers.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=423, footnote 52}}\n\n* The [[Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium|Departmental Auditorium]], designed by architect [[Arthur Brown Jr.]], was constructed from 1931 to 1936. Edward Ardolino company carved the Constitution Avenue pediment \u201cColumbia\u201d (Edgar Walter, sculptor) and also the nearby panels in the upper right and left corners behind the columns ([[L\u00e9on Hermant]], sculptor) and the panel and spandrels above the central arch behind the columns ([[Edmond Amateis]], sculptor).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=242, 277-279}}\n\n* The [[National Archives Building]], designed by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in partnership with [[Eggers & Higgins|Otto R. Eggers and Daniel Paul Higgins]], was erected between 1933 and 1935. Ardolino carved the Pennsylvania Avenue pediment \u201cDestiny,\u201d for sculptor [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=198, 223, 238}}<ref name=\":1\" /> The sculptor approved so strongly of Ardolino's role in executing the pedimental sculpture he invited him to add his name to the limestone pediment. Nowhere else in the Federal Triangle does a building bear the name of a carver.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=238}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nThroughout his career Ardolino won commissions that ranged widely in geographic location and type \u2013 from corporate and university structures, to government buildings, houses of worship and opulent residences. Experts like [[Ralph Adams Cram]], supervising architect of [[Princeton University Chapel]], shared credit for the chapel\u2019s quality with Ardolino in particular, saying his stone carving was \u201cthe best of its kind.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Cram, LITT.

{"title_page": "Transgender people in Singapore", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n{{Transgender sidebar}}\nThe history and [[subculture]] surrounding '''transgender people in Singapore''' is substantial. Not immediately apparent to Singapore's mainstream society is the fact that the gay community sees itself as a totally separate entity from the [[transgender]] communities (often also referred to as \"[[transvestite]] and [[transsexual]]\" communities). They are individual subcultures with many different priorities and concerns.\n\n==History==\n\n===National service===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n[[National service]] was implemented in 1967, whereby all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, depending on their educational attainment. [[Transgender]] was listed as a condition in a [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' and recruits who outed themselves to the examining doctors at the [[Central Manpower Base]] (CMPB) at [[Depot Road]] had their 'deployability' denied in sensitive positions. They were classified as Category 302 personnel, downgraded to a Physical Employment Status of C or E and assigned only non-combat roles at military bases.\n\n\"Transgender individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are able to skip National Service entirely. However due to the difficulty of transitioning early, only a very small percentage of transsexuals in Singapore are actually able to obtain SRS before having to enter National Service.\nIn rare cases, it's possible for transgender people to be exempted from National Service despite not undergoing sex reassignment surgery. However this is mostly up to the medical-officer in charge and varies case by case. In general, transsexuals that look like [[cisgender]] females have a much higher chance of being exempted.\"\n[http://pages.rediff.com/transgender-people-in-singapore/567537]\n\n===Early sex reassignment surgery===\nAs Singaporean gynaecological surgeons became more skilful, leaders in the field like Prof. S [[Shan Ratnam]] were authorised to perform [[Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female]] (SRS) at [[Kandang Kerbau Hospital]]. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could go under the knife, they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic [[psychiatrist]] Prof. [[Tsoi Wing Foo]].\n\n===Legal reform===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\"In 1973, Singapore legalised [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. A policy was instituted to enable post-operative transsexual people to change the legal gender on their identity cards (but not their birth certificates) and other documents which flowed from that. There was no specific provision in the statutes which allowed the Registrar to do this, so it existed probably only at the level of a policy directive. However, for over 20 years, this policy seemed to have operated smoothly.\"<ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/89780664/Transgender_people_in_Singapore]</ref>\n\n===Further developments in sex reassignment institutions===\nLater, the more technically demanding [[sex reassignment surgery female-to-male]] was also offered at [[Kandang Kerbau Hospital]] and at [[Alexandra Hospital]], performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the [[National University Hospital]] two decades later. It was headed by Prof. S [[Shan Ratnam]] until his retirement in 1995, after which leadership passed to his nephew, Dr. Anandakumar. In fact, for 30 years, Singapore was one of the world leaders in SRS, performing more than 500 such operations. This gave a new lease on life to the many transgender individuals whose bodies did not match their gender identity. As one consequence of this, Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of transgender people from transvestites to [[iatrogenic]] [[intersex]] individuals to fully transformed women.\n\nIn the 1970s, a well-known [[transsexual]] model was occasionally featured in [[Her World]] magazine.\n\n===Legalisation of transgender marriage===\nSince the mid-1970s, post-operative [[transsexual]] people had been discreetly lobbying to be given the right to marry opposite-sex spouses. In 1996, a bill was presented before the [[Parliament of Singapore]] and the [[Women's Charter]] amended to read:<ref>http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2009-REVED-353&doctitle=WOMEN%92S%20CHARTER%0A&date=latest&method=part&segid=1257908388-000148</ref>\n*Avoidance of marriages between persons of same sex.\n**(1) A marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between persons who, at the time of the marriage, are not respectively male and female shall be void.\n**(2) It is hereby declared that, subject to sections 5, 9, 10, 11 and 22, a marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between a person who has undergone a sex reassignment procedure and any person of the opposite sex is and shall be deemed always to have been a valid marriage.\n**(3) For the purpose of this section\n***(a) the sex of any party to a marriage as stated at the time of the marriage in his or her identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201) shall be prima facie evidence of the sex of the party; and\n***(b) a person who has undergone a sex reassignment procedure shall be identified as being of the sex to which the person has been reassigned.\n**(4) Nothing in subsection (2) shall validate any such marriage which had been declared by the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] before 1 May 1997 to be null and void on the ground that the parties were of the same sex.\n\nThe minister moving the bill argued that since 1973, the government's intention was for people who had changed gender/sex to live a life according to their new gender, including the right to marry. Through an oversight, the law relating to marriage had not been re-aligned with the official policy to recognise sex reassignment surgery. Now that the courts had illuminated this inconsistency after a landmark case in which a woman sought and won the annulment of her marriage to a [[trans man]] (Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric), it was necessary to amend the Women's Charter to ensure that the original intent was not undermined. Transgender people were officially granted their wish on 24 January 1996 via an announcement by [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Abdullah Tarmugi]] without much public fanfare or opposition.\n\n===Closure and reopening of the GIC===\nThe Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) at the [[National University Hospital]] quietly closed in 2001. The official explanation was that the gynaecologist in charge had left for private practice, and without him, the clinic did not have the skills to perform SRS. However, as early as 1987, the Ministry of Health had been directing hospitals to stop doing such operations on foreigners. It also discouraged them for Singaporeans, saying 'the increased danger of AIDS with such patients poses unnecessary risk to hospital staff'.\n\nThis dismayed transgender people seeking to have their operations performed locally. The online edition of the now-defunct newspaper [[Project Eyeball]] carried out a survey in June 2001 asking, \"Should [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-change]] operations be resumed in Singapore?\" 39% of respondents said, \"Yes, they are people with valid medical needs, like infertile couples\" and 35% said, \"Why not? It is legal here, as are [[transsexual]] marriages\". The results showed that Singaporeans were generally quite supportive.\n\nThe transgender community petitioned for the GIC to be reopened and were successful, with the clinic discreetly resuming its services in 2003, helmed by Dr. Ilancheran. However, owing to the [[discrimination against transgender people]] in Singapore even within some segments of the medical community, the high financial outlay involved and the necessity for psychological clearance, many preferred to have their operations performed sans the hassles in [[Bangkok]], which had by then become the premi\u00e8re centre for SRS.\n\n==Transgender Culture==\n\n===Bugis Street===\n{{Main article|Bugis Street}}\nOne of Singapore's most famous tourist meccas since the 1950s, renowned internationally for its nightly parade of flamboyantly dressed [[trans women]], Bugis Street attracted hordes of [[Whites|Caucasian]] gawkers who had never witnessed Asian queens in full regalia.\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:TranswomanBugisStreet.JPG|left|A trans woman sashaying down Bugis Street, being ogled at by tourists, circa the 1960s]] -->\n\nThe latter would tease, cajole and sit on visitors' laps or pose for photographs for a fee. The amount of revenue that they raked in was considerable, providing a shot in the arm for the tourism industry. Veterans recall that the notorious drinking section began at [[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]], and proceeded west to [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]]. Halfway between Victoria and Queen Streets, there was an intersecting lane parallel to the main roads, also lined with ''[[Al Fresco dining|al fresco]]'' bars. There was a well-patronised [[public toilet]] with a flat roof of which there are archival photos, complete with jubilant rooftop trans women. The earliest published description of Bugis Street found by [[Yawning Bread]] as a place of great gender diversity was in the book \"Eastern Windows\" by Ommaney, F.D. (1960. London:Longmans. pp.&nbsp;39\u201345). Ommaney did not date specifically his description of the street, but his book made clear that he was in Singapore from 1955 to 1960.<ref>See also, A first-person account of Bugis Street in the 1950s by Bob, a visiting Australian sailor:[https://web.archive.org/web/20041114093458/http://www.yawningbread.org/guest_2002/guw-078.htm]</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Bugis Street underwent major [[urban redevelopment]] into a retail complex of modern shopping malls, restaurants and nightspots mixed with regulated back-alley roadside vendors. Underground digging to construct the [[Bugis MRT station]] prior to that also caused the upheaval and termination of the nightly transgender sex bazaar culture, marking the end of a colourful and unique era in Singapore's history. Tourist and local lamentation of the loss sparked attempts by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to attempt to recreate some of the old sleazy splendour by staging contrived \"Ah Qua shows\" on wooden platforms, but these artificial performances failed to pull in the crowds. They were abandoned after a short time.\n\nBugis Street was immortalised in an English-language film of the same name, made, ironically, by a Hong Kong film company which did employ some local talent in its production.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Singapore_gay_films |title=Singapore gay films |access-date=28 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622123606/http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Singapore_gay_films |archive-date=22 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Johore Road===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\nFormerly located between and parallel to [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]] and [[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]], and bisected by [[Ophir Road]], Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, [[Bugis Street]], just a stone's throw away. It was the seedy haunt of transgender sex workers who solicited sex from locals, away from the glare of Western tourists.

It is the namesake of [[John Lee Hooker]]'s legendary [[blues]] club in San Francisco, shooting to international fame when the [[postmodernist]] magazine ''[[Wallpaper]]'' called it \"our top pick for a good night out in all of Asia!\"\n\nOriginally established by owner [[Alan Koh]] in 1993 at 4 [[New Bugis Street]] in [[Bugis Village]], it later relocated on 2 April 2000 to the second floor of the old 2-storey [[Chui Eng Free School]] schoolhouse at 130\u2013132 [[Amoy Street, Singapore|Amoy Street]], [[Far East Square]] (10 min walk from the [[Raffles Place MRT station]]).

There were 2 shows each night and outrageous wisecracks, in raw [[Singlish]] which made the banter difficult for tourists to understand, were interspersed with DJs playing the latest chart tunes. Members of the audience sitting next to the stage ran the highest risk of being drawn into the performance. It was patronised by a largely heterosexual audience who danced wildly during the intervals, but Tuesday nights were gay with access only granted to password holders.\n\nIt closed after 12 years on 15 January 2005, reportedly to enable its artists to move on to fresh creative pursuits. However, many thought other reasons were that the shows were getting stale, the [[drag queen]]s were getting old ([[Kumar (drag queen)|Kumar]] was 36) with no fresh blood to carry the torch and the existing ones not having what it took, and the club's poor location. It spawned a [[Parody|spoof]] version called the [[Bang Bang Room]] at [[Changi Village]] which held late night performances every weekend.\n\n===Desker Road vicinity===\nA well-known area for men seeking the services of cisgender women sex workers in the [[Serangoon]] or [[Little India (location)|Little India]] area for decades, it attracted many transgender sex workers from nearby [[Johore Road]] after the latter was erased from the map by a fire in the late 1990s.\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:DeskerRoad001.JPG|230px|Desker Road by day, viewed from Serangoon Road.]] -->\n{{clear|left}}\n\nUnlike their cisgender female government-regulated counterparts who are on display, usually seated on armchairs or sofas in well-lit rooms, reminiscent of a low-class back-lane version of [[Amsterdam]], the [[trans women]] of [[Desker Road]], in contrast, cruise while standing or strolling.

Together, they spent $50,000 to open the venue in July 2005, six months after the closure of Boom Boom Room.\n\nAiming for the high-end market, Gold Dust boasts professional dancers with flamboyant [[mardi gras]]-type costumes, and women dancing alongside drag performers.

Thus, the {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} club has no dance floor and all the chairs and tables face the stage. It can hold 180 people, and has the feel of a 1970s glam [[disco]], updated for the new generation. Instead of young National Servicemen and students, who formed a significant part of the [[Boom Boom Room]] clientele, Gold Dust intends to target a slightly more upper-crust crowd.\n\nThe main aim of the [[theatre bar]] is to showcase talent. In addition to the cabaret dances and stand-up comedy staples, it is considering expanding the shows to include [[mime artist|mime]], monologues, plays and singing. Partner Kumar decided to open the venture because he needed a steady income stream, as well as a home base for his stand-up performances. Although the bar is located in the back block of Orchard Towers where [[Harry's Bar (Singapore)|Harry's Bar]] and [[Jason's supermarket]] reside, some felt that the idea of a bar next to the infamous '4 floors of whores' may not appeal to some patrons. However, Kumar felt that Orchard Towers was always known to be a controversial place, and since he was also a controversial performer who pushed the boundaries, it made sense for the bar to be based there.'\n\nFor the first time, Kumar's show incorporates two female professional dancers, [[Samantha Kan]] and [[Aslinda]].

Not immediately apparent to Singapore's mainstream society is the fact that the gay community sees itself as a totally separate entity from the [[transgender]] communities (often also referred to as \"[[transvestite]] and [[transsexual]]\" communities). They are individual subcultures with many different priorities and concerns.\n\n==History==\n\n===National service===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n[[National service]] was implemented in 1967, whereby all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, depending on their educational attainment. [[Transgender]] was listed as a condition in a [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' and recruits who outed themselves to the examining doctors at the [[Central Manpower Base]] (CMPB) at [[Depot Road]] had their 'deployability' denied in sensitive positions. They were classified as Category 302 personnel, downgraded to a Physical Employment Status of C or E and assigned only non-combat roles at military bases.\n\n\"Transgender individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are able to skip National Service entirely. However due to the difficulty of transitioning early, only a very small percentage of transsexuals in Singapore are actually able to obtain SRS before having to enter National Service.\nIn rare cases, it's possible for transgender people to be exempted from National Service despite not undergoing sex reassignment surgery. However this is mostly up to the medical-officer in charge and varies case by case. In general, transsexuals that look like [[cisgender]] females have a much higher chance of being exempted.\"\n[http://pages.rediff.com/transgender-people-in-singapore/567537]\n\n===Early sex reassignment surgery===\nAs Singaporean gynaecological surgeons became more skilful, leaders in the field like Prof. S [[Shan Ratnam]] were authorised to perform [[Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female]] (SRS) at [[Kandang Kerbau Hospital]]. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could go under the knife, they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic [[psychiatrist]] Prof. [[Tsoi Wing Foo]].\n\n===Legal reform===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\"In 1973, Singapore legalised [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. A policy was instituted to enable post-operative transsexual people to change the legal gender on their identity cards (but not their birth certificates) and other documents which flowed from that. There was no specific provision in the statutes which allowed the Registrar to do this, so it existed probably only at the level of a policy directive. However, for over 20 years, this policy seemed to have operated smoothly.\"<ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/89780664/Transgender_people_in_Singapore]</ref>\n\n===Further developments in sex reassignment institutions===\nLater, the more technically demanding [[sex reassignment surgery female-to-male]] was also offered at [[Kandang Kerbau Hospital]] and at [[Alexandra Hospital]], performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the [[National University Hospital]] two decades later. It was headed by Prof. S [[Shan Ratnam]] until his retirement in 1995, after which leadership passed to his nephew, Dr. Anandakumar. In fact, for 30 years, Singapore was one of the world leaders in SRS, performing more than 500 such operations. This gave a new lease on life to the many transgender individuals whose bodies did not match their gender identity. As one consequence of this, Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of transgender people from transvestites to [[iatrogenic]] [[intersex]] individuals to fully transformed women.\n\nIn the 1970s, a well-known [[transsexual]] model was occasionally featured in [[Her World]] magazine.\n\n===Legalisation of transgender marriage===\nSince the mid-1970s, post-operative [[transsexual]] people had been discreetly lobbying to be given the right to get married to opposite-sex spouses. In 1996, a bill was presented before the [[Parliament of Singapore]] and the [[Women's Charter]] amended to read:<ref>http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2009-REVED-353&doctitle=WOMEN%92S%20CHARTER%0A&date=latest&method=part&segid=1257908388-000148</ref>\n*Avoidance of marriages between persons of same sex.\n**(1) A marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between persons who, at the time of the marriage, are not respectively male and female shall be void.\n**(2) It is hereby declared that, subject to sections 5, 9, 10, 11 and 22, a marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between a person who has undergone a sex reassignment procedure and any person of the opposite sex is and shall be deemed always to have been a valid marriage.\n**(3) For the purpose of this section\n***(a) the sex of any party to a marriage as stated at the time of the marriage in his or her identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201) shall be prima facie evidence of the sex of the party; and\n***(b) a person who has undergone a sex reassignment procedure shall be identified as being of the sex to which the person has been reassigned.\n**(4) Nothing in subsection (2) shall validate any such marriage which had been declared by the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] before 1 May 1997 to be null and void on the ground that the parties were of the same sex.\n\nThe minister moving the bill argued that since 1973, the government's intention was for people who had changed gender/sex to live a life according to their new gender, including the right to marry. Through an oversight, the law relating to marriage had not been re-aligned with the official policy to recognise sex reassignment surgery. Now that the courts had illuminated this inconsistency after a landmark case in which a woman sought and won the annulment of her marriage to a [[trans man]] (Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric), it was necessary to amend the Women's Charter to ensure that the original intent was not undermined. Transgender people were officially granted their wish on 24 January 1996 via an announcement by [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Abdullah Tarmugi]] without much public fanfare or opposition.\n\n===Closure and reopening of the GIC===\nThe Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) at the [[National University Hospital]] quietly closed in 2001. The official explanation was that the gynaecologist in charge had left for private practice, and without him, the clinic did not have the skills to perform SRS. However, as early as 1987, the Ministry of Health had been directing hospitals to stop doing such operations on foreigners. It also discouraged them for Singaporeans, saying 'the increased danger of AIDS with such patients poses unnecessary risk to hospital staff'.\n\nThis dismayed transgender people seeking to have their operations performed locally. The online edition of the now-defunct newspaper [[Project Eyeball]] carried out a survey in June 2001 asking, \"Should [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-change]] operations be resumed in Singapore?\" 39% of respondents said, \"Yes, they are people with valid medical needs, like infertile couples\" and 35% said, \"Why not? It is legal here, as are [[transsexual]] marriages\". The results showed that Singaporeans were generally quite supportive.\n\nThe transgender community petitioned for the GIC to be reopened and were successful, with the clinic discreetly resuming its services in 2003, helmed by Dr. Ilancheran. However, owing to the [[discrimination against transgender people]] in Singapore even within some segments of the medical community, the high financial outlay involved and the necessity for psychological clearance, many preferred to have their operations performed sans the hassles in [[Bangkok]], which had by then become the premi\u00e8re centre for SRS.\n\n==Transgender Culture==\n\n===Bugis Street===\n{{Main article|Bugis Street}}\nOne of Singapore's most famous tourist meccas since the 1950s, renowned internationally for its nightly parade of flamboyantly dressed [[trans women]], Bugis Street attracted hordes of [[Whites|Caucasian]] gawkers who had never witnessed Asian queens in full regalia.\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:TranswomanBugisStreet.JPG|left|A trans woman sashaying down Bugis Street, being ogled at by tourists, circa the 1960s]] -->\n\nThe latter would tease, cajole and sit on visitors' laps or pose for photographs for a fee. The amount of revenue that they raked in was considerable, providing a shot in the arm for the tourism industry. Veterans recall that the notorious drinking section began at [[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]], and proceeded west to [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]]. Halfway between Victoria and Queen Streets, there was an intersecting lane parallel to the main roads, also lined with ''[[Al Fresco dining|al fresco]]'' bars. There was a well-patronised [[public toilet]] with a flat roof of which there are archival photos, complete with jubilant rooftop trans women. The earliest published description of Bugis Street found by [[Yawning Bread]] as a place of great gender diversity was in the book \"Eastern Windows\" by Ommaney, F.D. (1960. London:Longmans. pp.&nbsp;39\u201345). Ommaney did not date specifically his description of the street, but his book made clear that he was in Singapore from 1955 to 1960.<ref>See also, A first-person account of Bugis Street in the 1950s by Bob, a visiting Australian sailor:[https://web.archive.org/web/20041114093458/http://www.yawningbread.org/guest_2002/guw-078.htm]</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Bugis Street underwent major [[urban redevelopment]] into a retail complex of modern shopping malls, restaurants and nightspots mixed with regulated back-alley roadside vendors. Underground digging to construct the [[Bugis MRT station]] prior to that also caused the upheaval and termination of the nightly transgender sex bazaar culture, marking the end of a colourful and unique era in Singapore's history. Tourist and local lamentation of the loss sparked attempts by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to attempt to recreate some of the old sleazy splendour by staging contrived \"Ah Qua shows\" on wooden platforms, but these artificial performances failed to pull in the crowds. They were abandoned after a short time.\n\nBugis Street was immortalised in an English-language film of the same name, made, ironically, by a Hong Kong film company which did employ some local talent in its production.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Singapore_gay_films |title=Singapore gay films |access-date=28 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622123606/http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Singapore_gay_films |archive-date=22 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Johore Road===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\nFormerly located between and parallel to [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]] and [[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]], and bisected by [[Ophir Road]], Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, [[Bugis Street]], just a stone's throw away.

It was released in June 2003 as the lead single from their third album, ''[[Elephunk]]''. The song was written by [[will.i.am]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Printz Board]], Michael Fratantuno and [[George Pajon]]. The track features vocals from Timberlake, although he is not officially credited on the single release. It was the group's first song to feature singer [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] as an official member.\n\n\"Where Is the Love?\" saw success on radio airplay charts,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484775/road-to-the-grammys-the-making-of-black-eyed-peas-where-is-the-love/ | title=Road to the Grammys: The Making of Black Eyed Peas' 'Where Is the Love' | work=MTV News | date=March 2, 2004 | accessdate=September 2, 2016}}</ref> peaked at number eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It became the biggest-selling single of 2003 in the latter country. The band and Timberlake received two nominations, [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]], for \"Where Is the Love?\" at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/topics/g/grammy/2004/nominees/nominees.jhtml |title=2004 Grammy Nominees |publisher=MTV |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502134948/http://www.mtv.com/news/topics/g/grammy/2004/nominees/nominees.jhtml |archivedate=May 2, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the commercial failures of their previous albums and singles, there was doubt over whether [[The Black Eyed Peas]] would continue to record together. A&R executive [[Ron Fair]] approached them and suggested a crossover to a more mainstream pop sound. [[will.i.am]] in particular resisted the idea for fear that they would be seen as sellouts. However, after discussions and some writing sessions, the idea was pursued.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484775/20040203/black_eyed_peas.jhtml |title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Black Eyed Peas' 'Where Is The Love' - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\nShortly after [[Christmas]] 2001, [[will.i.am]] created a loop and a guitar part that he liked. [[apl.de.ap]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] also heard the track and were able to write similar lyrics over it. [[Justin Timberlake]] was introduced to the group by [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], and got a chance to hear the track that will.i.am created. Impressed with the music, Timberlake helped write and sing the chorus.\n\nTimberlake was in the midst of promotion of his debut solo album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'', and his label [[Jive Records]] was concerned about possible overexposure. The Black Eyed Peas were worried about this, as getting some assistance from an established pop star like Timberlake had been the original point of this song. A compromise was reached eventually in which Jive gave clearance for the vocals of Timberlake to be released on the song, but he does not appear in the song's music video nor is he officially credited on the song as an artist. By 2008, the single had sold 954,000 digital copies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grein |first=Paul |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/32895/week-ending-april-5-2009-a-prince-beats-a-king-of-pop/ |title=Week Ending April 5, 2009: A Prince Beats A King (Of Pop) &#124; Chart Watch - Yahoo! Music |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:JustinTimberlakeJune07 crop.jpg|thumb|170px|upright|right|Timberlake co-wrote the song and provided vocals.]]\nThe song was written by [[will.i.am]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Fair]], [[Printz Board]], [[George Pajon]], Fiona Davies M. Fratantuno, and J. Curtis, and co-produced by will.i.am and Ron Fair. In this song, [[The Black Eyed Peas]] lament on various worldwide problems. Many issues are discussed, which include but are not limited to [[terrorism]], [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] hypocrisy, [[racism]], [[gang crime]], [[pollution]], war and intolerance.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song was rewarded with nominations at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2004 for [[Record of the Year]] and [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]].\n\nThe song was the biggest selling single of 2003 in the UK. It was also the 25th best-selling single of the 2000s (decade) in the UK.<ref name=\"UK decade-end\">Radio 1 Chart of the Decade, as presented by [[DJ Nihal]] on December 29, 2009</ref>\n\nOn May 12, 2013, after 10 years since the song's release, the song re-entered the official UK singles charts at 40, eventually peaking at 35.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Where Is the Love?\" was shot in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] and features [[The Black Eyed Peas]] and various other people, including various young children, asking the world where the love really is. In the video, [[will.i.am]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] act as a [[soul music]] road duo who use music to tell people what is wrong with the world, [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] appears as a peacemaker who places stickers with question marks on them all over the place to ask people where the love is in the world, and [[apl.de.ap]] is a criminal who is arrested for using criminal offences to tell people the truth. [[Justin Timberlake]] does not appear in the video, although several different people are seen mouthing his part.\n\nThe video is similar to a 2002 British television advertisement for [[T-Mobile]], in which a face of a young baby is presented in various forms around a large city, much like the question mark in this video. The [[Bon Jovi]] music video \"[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)|Have a Nice Day]]\" is also similar to both the advertisement and this video.\n\nThe video features gameplay footage of the extremely graphic and controversial video game ''[[Postal 2]]'', in which a group of young children are playing the game. This suggests that violence in the media and entertainment industry affects the morals of children. Near the beginning of the video, posters of the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' are shown.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n; CD single\n# \"Where Is the Love?\" \u2013 4:35\n\n==Personnel==\n* Arranged by [[Ron Fair]]\n* Writers \u2013 [[will.i.am]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Printz Board]], Michael Fratantuno, [[George Pajon|George Pajon, Jr.]]\n*Producers \u2013 will.i.am, Ron Fair\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (2003\u20132004)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|19|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{single chart|CIS|11|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is the Love|songid=249|accessdate=10 August 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Denmark|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|16|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|1|songid=5750|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=March 12, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Hungarytop10|3|week=2|year=2004}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Hungary|7|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|year=2004|week=12|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Hungarydance|10|year=2003|week=46}} \n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|1|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Italy|3|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|1|year=2003|week=40|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=March 12, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n|Poland ([[Polish Singles Chart|Nielsen Music Control]])<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024120708/http://www.pifpaf.com.pl/airplay/lista_47_2003.html|title=Nielsen Music Control|archivedate=2007-10-24|url=http://www.nielsenmusiccontrol.com/index_pol}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Romania ([[Romanian Top 100]])<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041013001619/http://www.rt100.ro/ed.php?tn=x10100 Romanian Top 100: Editia 1, saptamina 5.01 -

It was released in June 2003 as the lead single from their third album, ''[[Elephunk]]''. The song was written by [[will.i.am]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Printz Board]], Michael Fratantuno and [[George Pajon]]. The track features vocals from Timberlake, although he is not officially credited on the single release. It was the group's first song to feature singer [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] as an official member.\n\n\"Where Is the Love?\" saw success on radio airplay charts,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484775/road-to-the-grammys-the-making-of-black-eyed-peas-where-is-the-love/ | title=Road to the Grammys: The Making of Black Eyed Peas' 'Where Is the Love' | work=MTV News | date=March 2, 2004 | accessdate=September 2, 2016}}</ref> peaked at number eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It became the biggest-selling single of 2003 in the latter country. The band and Timberlake received two nominations, [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]], for \"Where Is the Love?\" at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/topics/g/grammy/2004/nominees/nominees.jhtml |title=2004 Grammy Nominees |publisher=MTV |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502134948/http://www.mtv.com/news/topics/g/grammy/2004/nominees/nominees.jhtml |archivedate=May 2, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the commercial failures of their previous albums and singles, there was doubt over whether [[The Black Eyed Peas]] would continue to record together. A&R executive [[Ron Fair]] approached them and suggested a crossover to a more mainstream pop sound. [[will.i.am]] in particular resisted the idea for fear that they would be seen as sellouts. However, after discussions and some writing sessions, the idea was pursued.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484775/20040203/black_eyed_peas.jhtml |title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Black Eyed Peas' 'Where Is The Love' - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\nShortly after [[Christmas]] 2001, [[will.i.am]] created a loop and a guitar part that he liked. [[apl.de.ap]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] also heard the track and were able to write similar lyrics over it. [[Justin Timberlake]] was introduced to the group by [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], and got a chance to hear the track that will.i.am created. Impressed with the music, Timberlake helped write and sing the chorus.\n\nTimberlake was in the midst of promotion of his debut solo album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'', and his label [[Jive Records]] was concerned about possible overexposure. The Black Eyed Peas were worried about this, as getting some assistance from an established pop star like Timberlake had been the original point of this song. A compromise was reached eventually in which Jive gave clearance for the vocals of Timberlake to be released on the song, but he does not appear in the song's music video nor is he officially credited on the song as an artist. By 2008, the single had sold 954,000 digital copies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grein |first=Paul |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/32895/week-ending-april-5-2009-a-prince-beats-a-king-of-pop/ |title=Week Ending April 5, 2009: A Prince Beats A King (Of Pop) &#124; Chart Watch - Yahoo! Music |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:JustinTimberlakeJune07 crop.jpg|thumb|170px|upright|right|Timberlake co-wrote the song and provided vocals.]]\nThe song was written by [[will.i.am]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Fair]], [[Printz Board]], [[George Pajon]], Fiona Davies M. Fratantuno, and J. Curtis, and co-produced by will.i.am and Ron Fair. In this song, [[The Black Eyed Peas]] lament on various worldwide problems. Many issues are discussed, which include but are not limited to [[terrorism]], [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] hypocrisy, [[racism]], [[gang crime]], [[pollution]], war and intolerance.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song was rewarded with nominations at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2004 for [[Record of the Year]] and [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]].\n\nThe song was the biggest selling single of 2003 in the UK. It was also the 25th best-selling single of the 2000s (decade) in the UK.<ref name=\"UK decade-end\">Radio 1 Chart of the Decade, as presented by [[DJ Nihal]] on December 29, 2009</ref>\n\nOn May 12, 2013, after 10 years since the song's release, the song re-entered the official UK singles charts at 40, eventually peaking at 35.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Where Is the Love?\" was shot in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] and features [[The Black Eyed Peas]] and various other people, including various young children, asking the world where the love really is. In the video, [[will.i.am]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] act as a [[soul music]] road duo who use music to tell people what is wrong with the world, [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] appears as a peacemaker who places stickers with question marks on them all over the place to ask people where the love is in the world, and [[apl.de.ap]] is a criminal who is arrested for using criminal offences to tell people the truth. [[Justin Timberlake]] does not appear in the video, although several different people are seen mouthing his part.\n\nThe video is similar to a 2002 British television advertisement for [[T-Mobile]], in which a face of a young baby is presented in various forms around a large city, much like the question mark in this video. The [[Bon Jovi]] music video \"[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)|Have a Nice Day]]\" is also similar to both the advertisement and this video.\n\nThe video features gameplay footage of the extremely graphic and controversial video game ''[[Postal 2]]'', in which a group of young children are playing the game. This suggests that violence in the media and entertainment industry affects the morals of children. Near the beginning of the video, posters of the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' are shown.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n; CD single\n# \"Where Is the Love?\" \u2013 4:35\n\n==Personnel==\n* Arranged by [[Ron Fair]]\n* Writers \u2013 [[will.i.am]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]], [[apl.de.ap]], [[Printz Board]], Michael Fratantuno, [[George Pajon|George Pajon, Jr.]]\n*Producers \u2013 will.i.am, Ron Fair\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (2003\u20132004)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|19|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{single chart|CIS|11|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is the Love|songid=249|accessdate=10 August 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Denmark|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|16|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|1|songid=5750|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=March 12, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Hungarytop10|3|week=2|year=2004}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Hungary|7|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|year=2004|week=12|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Hungarydance|10|year=2003|week=46}} \n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|1|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Italy|3|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|1|year=2003|week=40|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?|accessdate=March 12, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|1|artist=The Black Eyed Peas|song=Where Is The Love?}}\n|-\n|Poland ([[Polish Singles Chart|Nielsen Music Control]])<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024120708/http://www.pifpaf.com.pl/airplay/lista_47_2003.html|title=Nielsen Music Control|archivedate=2007-10-24|url=http://www.nielsenmusiccontrol.com/index_pol}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Romania ([[Romanian Top 100]])<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041013001619/http://www.rt100.ro/ed.php?tn=x10100 Romanian Top 100: Editia 1, saptamina 5.01 -
