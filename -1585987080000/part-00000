Earth Tangent's economic, geographic and political landscapes are defined by the superhero community, whereas in the DCU those aspects exist unaffected by the superhero community.}}\n\n==Publication history==\n===Superman===\nAccording to [[Dan Jurgens]], the reconceptualization of Superman \"went through many permutations.\" An early idea eschewed powers altogether and revolved around highlighting the \"man\" in \"Super'''man''',\" and making him \"a cop, or a doctor or something different. A guy with no powers but tremendous character who fights on behalf of his fellow man.\" Writer Millar noted that \"the classic Superman role is already filled by the Atom,\" and wanted to echo \"[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s [[The Metamorphosis|metamorphosis]] where we actually see this likable, regular guy transform into a superhuman.\" Thus Millar took Jurgens' early idea \"of the average Joe as the superMAN,\" and used artist Guice's \"unique approach to the flashback scenes\" (as seen in his ''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' work) to create a different style than that used by Guice on his ''[[Action Comics]]'' work. The Tangent universe's Superman utilises the name of DC villain [[Two-Face]] (Harvey Dent) rather than the name 'Clark Kent.' Superman's powers, according to his writer, are that \"his brain is evolving at an accelerated rate\" thanks to a 'god-force'.<ref name=\"T199\">\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Man of Tomorrow\", ''Tangent Comics Volume Three'' (DC, 2008) {{ISBN|978-1-4012-1806-5}}, DC Comics, p. 199</ref>\n\n===Wonder Woman===\nWriter [[Peter David]] worked from Jurgens' concept that Tangent's Wonder Woman is \"a female warrior\" exiled to Earth for sins committed on another world. Seeking a twist to make her different from the original [[DC Universe|DCU]] character, David thought up Wanda's origin as \"a symbol of what [her] world could be if [her people] were united.\" Combining two diverse aspects, she \"seems distracted in any combat situation\" and \"would rather not fight,\" preferring \"pondering some deep philosophical point.\" After the character conception, artist Gene Ha produced design artwork, initially of a [[bearded lady]], but eventually merely \"a very alien woman.\"<ref name=\"T200\">\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Wonder Woman\", ''Tangent Comics Volume Three'', DC Comics, p. 200</ref>\n\n===Nightwing: Nightforce===\nWriter Ostrander previously wrote ''Nightwing'' for the first wave of Tangent issues, and for his second wave issue christened the team (Hex, Black Orchid and Wildcat) 'Nightforce'. Citing the benefit of the Tangent line as giving \"a far greater freedom to sculpt the world in any fashion we want,\" Jurgens said that for the second wave he hoped to \"see Earth totally and completely subjugated.\" As the Tangent universe's premiere covert team, much of the \"mammoth task\" of staging a pivotal Tangent event fell to Ostrander, who installed an undead, [[vampire]] [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] as head of a Soviet Empire. Ostrander also revealed the 'Dark Circle', whose members could be killed and \"resurrected as a warrior, ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' style, for the Ultra-Humanite.\"<ref name=\"T201\">\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Nightwing Nightforce\". ''Tangent Comics Volume Three'' DC Comics, p. 201</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe history of the Tangent Universe radically diverges from the real world due to the presence of superheroes. The interference of the original [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] causes the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that results in the nuclear obliteration of [[Florida]] and [[Cuba]]. The aftermath of the destruction of Florida shapes the lives of several characters.\n\nThe city of New Atlantis is created out of the remains of the city of Atlanta and is later the birthplace of the [[Alternative versions of Joker#Alternative universes|Joker]]. A group of sea creatures are mutated by the radioactive fallout into humanoid form and become known as the [[Sea Devils (comics)|Sea Devils]]. The other major event to have repercussions is the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which leads to the creation of the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and deployment of alternate [[Metal Men]] as a U.S. [[black ops]] squad. As a result of the Cuban War in this timeline, the Soviet Union still existed in the late 90s and was still a world superpower. However, China was not involved in this nuclear exchange and has its own metahuman genetic experimentation program, resulting in the creation of [[Supergirl]] and [[Powergirl]].\n\n==Series==\nBased on concepts created by Dan Jurgens, Tangent Comics as a whole is dedicated to [[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]].<ref name=\"T4\">''Tangent Comics Volume Three'', p. 4</ref>\n\n===1997 titles===\n*''[[Atom (comics)|The Atom]]''\n**The grandson of the Tangent Earth's first superhero, an atomic veteran, takes on the mantle and learns a horrible truth about his family.

The trio joins the Tangent Spectre and the Tangent Manhunter in freeing the Atom, leaving John Stewart captured by the Tangent Superman, ruler of Earth-9. While being interrogated by the Tangent Superman, John Stewart's ring is contacted by Hal Jordan's ring, which the Tangent Green Lantern uses to bring additional members of the Justice League to Earth-9. The rescued Atom is revealed to be the Tangent Powergirl, lover to the Tangent Superman, and a fight ensues. The Tangent Manhunter is brutally murdered. The Tangent Superman takes Stewart's [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], and uses the ring, augmented by his psychic powers and the magic of the Tangent Orion to travel to New Earth, home of the mainstream DC Universe. Meanwhile, Batman infiltrates the Core, hub of information on Earth-9, and is saved by the Tangent Batman while escaping, who is mounting a revolution against the Tangent Superman. The Tangent Superman and the Tangent Powergirl battle their New Earth counterparts, only to escape and destroy the [[White House]]. The Tangent Superman proceeds to kidnap the world's leaders, cede power from them and detonate a [[nuclear weapon]] to distract New Earth's heroes. While on Earth-9, the heroes find and recruit the Tangent Superman's last tie to humanity, his wife Lola Dent. The heroes on Earth-9 transport themselves back to New Earth, where the combined forces of New Earth's and Earth-9's heroes fight against the Tangent Superman, the Tangent Powergirl and a cadre of villains that the Earth-9 ruler has gathered from New Earth ([[Lex Luthor]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Mr. Freeze]], the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], [[Black Manta]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Felix Faust]]), as well as the Tangent [[Ultra-Humanite]]. The raging battle against the Tangent Superman weakens him, allowing him to be ultimately defeated by his wife, concluding the story.\n\n===''Convergence'' (2015)===\n''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' is a two-month weekly [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], published by [[DC Comics]], that ran from April 2015 to May 2015. ''Convergence'' spins out of the final issues of the weekly series, ''[[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2: World's End]]'' and ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]''. The story involves [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] trapping cities from various timelines and planets that have ended, transporting them in domes to a planet outside of time and space, and \"opening them for a great experiment to see what happens when all these folks meet.\" Notable during this event is the return of DC characters from before the 2011 \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline that led to the creation of ''[[The New 52]]'' Universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/dc-convergence-week-three-wolfman-teen-titans-wein-swamp-thing-tangent-justice-league-detroit/ |title='Convergence' Week 3: 'Teen Titans', 'Swamp Thing', And More |author=Andrew Wheeler |date=25 November 2014 |work=Comics Alliance |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085243/http://comicsalliance.com/dc-convergence-week-three-wolfman-teen-titans-wein-swamp-thing-tangent-justice-league-detroit/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Interactions with the main DC Universe==\n''[[The Kingdom (comic book)|The Kingdom]]'' (1998) revealed that the Tangent Universe was part of [[Hypertime]], a fluid system of alternate realities based on splitting and re-merging timelines. Regular DC characters became aware of the Tangent Universe, but did not interact with it.\n\n''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2006) identified the Tangent Universe as ''Earth-97'', part of the recreated [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. As Earth-97 was being destroyed in the chaos, Green Lantern said that the heroes had to follow her lantern's light in order to survive. At the end of the story on New Earth, two children found the lantern belonging to the Tangent Universe's Green Lantern washed up on a beach.\n\nThe Tangent Universe's Green Lantern, Flash and Atom appeared in ''[[Ion (comics)|Ion]]'' #9-10 (2007), in which they displaced Ion and the two children who had found the lantern. Ion found himself in [[the Bleed]], where he encountered [[Captain Atom]]. Upon returning to Earth, Ion defeated the Tangent heroes, apparently by sending them back to their native dimension. During this appearance, everything said by the Tangent heroes was a repeat of lines from the original Tangent comics run.\n\nThe Tangent Universe's Green Lantern later appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #50, where she fled to New Earth in order to warn its heroes of an impending attack by the [[Crime Syndicate of Amerika]]. During the issue, it was revealed that the Syndicate members had ravaged the Tangent Earth and killed many of its heroes in the process. The Tangent Green Lantern later became instrumental in the ensuing battle by temporarily resurrecting [[Alexander Luthor]], and by the end of the story, the Tangent Universe had been restored to its former state.\n\n===Earth-9===\nThe \"History of the Multiverse\" backup stories in the 2007-2008 series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' established that the Tangent Universe now exists as one of the new 52 alternate universes. DC's official list of the current known multiverse lists the Tangent Universe as ''Earth-9''.\n\n==Trade paperbacks==\nDC Comics began reprinting the Tangent Comics one-shots in 2007 with a series of trade paperbacks.\n\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 1'' (August 2007), 208 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Atom'', ''Metal Men'', ''The Flash'', ''Green Lantern'' and ''Sea Devils'' one-shots.\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 2'' (January 2008), 192 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Joker'', ''Nightwing'', ''Batman'', ''Secret Six'' and ''Doom Patrol'' one-shots.\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 3'' (June 2008), 208 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Superman'', ''Wonder Woman'', ''The Joker's Wild'', ''JLA'', ''Tales of the Green Lantern'', ''Power Girl'', ''Nightwing: Nightforce'', and ''Trials of the Flash'' one-shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/12/12/dcs-collected-editions-mayjune-08/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712190203/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/12/12/dcs-collected-editions-mayjune-08/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=THE BEAT \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb DC\u2019s Collected Editions \u2014 May/June \u201808 |publisher=Pwbeat.publishersweekly.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref>\n*''Tangent: Superman's Reign Volume 1'', 160 pages collecting #1\u20136 and ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #16\n*''Tangent: Superman's Reign Volume 2'', 144 pages collecting #7\u201312\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing09/ccabana.shtml Superman and Batman in Tangent Comics]\n*[http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/tangent.html The Flash in Tangent Comics]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=imprint|id=8|title=Tangent (DC Comics)}}\n\n{{DC Comics imprints}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics imprints]]\n[[Category:1997 in comics]]\n[[Category:1998 in comics]]\n[[Category:Comics by Andy Lanning]]\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Jurgens]]\n[[Category:Comics by John Ostrander]]\n[[Category:Comics by Kurt Busiek]]\n[[Category:Comics by Mark Millar]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox publisher\n| name         = Tangent Comics\n| image        = Tangent_comics_logo.jpg\n| status       = inactive (2008)\n| founded      = 1998\n| founder      = [[Dan Jurgens]] (Writer)<br>Eddie Berganza (Editor)\n| successor    = \n| country      = \n| headquarters = \n| distribution = \n| keypeople    = \n| publications = Comics\n| topics       = \n| genre        = superheroes\n| imprints     = \n| revenue      = \n| numemployees = \n| nasdaq       = \n| url          = \n}}\n\n'''Tangent Comics''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] created in 1997, developed from ideas by [[Dan Jurgens]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 281 |quote = A series of nine one-shots springing from the imagination of writer/artist Dan Jurgens, the Tangent Comics imprint introduced an entirely new universe of heroes.}}</ref> The line, formed from various one-shots, focused on creating all-new characters using established DC names, such as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Superman]], and the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]].

However, China was not involved in this nuclear exchange and has its own metahuman genetic experimentation program, resulting in the creation of [[Supergirl]] and [[Powergirl]].\n\n==Series==\nBased on concepts created by Dan Jurgens, Tangent Comics as a whole is dedicated to [[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]].<ref name=\"T4\">''Tangent Comics Volume Three'', p. 4</ref>\n\n===1997 titles===\n*''[[Atom (comics)|The Atom]]''\n**The grandson of the Tangent Earth's first superhero, an atomic veteran, takes on the mantle and learns a horrible truth about his family.

The series ran between March 2008 until February 2009, and was written by Dan Jurgens with art by Jamal Igle and Carlos Magno. The series was met with favorable reviews, noting strong character development and plotting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.girlsentertainmentnetwork.com/graphic-novel-review-supermans-reign-vol-1 |title=Review of '&#39;Tangent: Superman\u2019s Reign'&#39; #1 at Girls Entertainment Network; April 2, 2009 |publisher=Girlsentertainmentnetwork.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2011-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708083109/http://www.girlsentertainmentnetwork.com/graphic-novel-review-supermans-reign-vol-1/ |archivedate=July 8, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectededitions.blogspot.com/2009/03/review-tangent-supermans-reign-vol-1.html |title=Review: Tangent: Superman's Reign Vol. 1 trade paperback (DC Comics) Collected Editions; March 16, 2009 |publisher=Collectededitions.blogspot.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>\n\nIn efforts to aid an alternate-reality-displaced Tangent Flash (Lia Nelson), Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and Flash [[Wally West]] are inexplicably transported to Earth-9, the Tangent Universe, by the Tangent Green Lantern. The trio joins the Tangent Spectre and the Tangent Manhunter in freeing the Atom, leaving John Stewart captured by the Tangent Superman, ruler of Earth-9. While being interrogated by the Tangent Superman, John Stewart's ring is contacted by Hal Jordan's ring, which the Tangent Green Lantern uses to bring additional members of the Justice League to Earth-9. The rescued Atom is revealed to be the Tangent Powergirl, lover to the Tangent Superman, and a fight ensues. The Tangent Manhunter is brutally murdered. The Tangent Superman takes Stewart's [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], and uses the ring, augmented by his psychic powers and the magic of the Tangent Orion to travel to New Earth, home of the mainstream DC Universe. Meanwhile, Batman infiltrates the Core, hub of information on Earth-9, and is saved by the Tangent Batman while escaping, who is mounting a revolution against the Tangent Superman. The Tangent Superman and the Tangent Powergirl battle their New Earth counterparts, only to escape and destroy the [[White House]]. The Tangent Superman proceeds to kidnap the world's leaders, cede power from them and detonate a [[nuclear weapon]] to distract New Earth's heroes. While on Earth-9, the heroes find and recruit the Tangent Superman's last tie to humanity, his wife Lola Dent. The heroes on Earth-9 transport themselves back to New Earth, where the combined forces of New Earth's and Earth-9's heroes fight against the Tangent Superman, the Tangent Powergirl and a cadre of villains that the Earth-9 ruler has gathered from New Earth ([[Lex Luthor]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Mr. Freeze]], the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], [[Black Manta]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Felix Faust]]), as well as the Tangent [[Ultra-Humanite]]. The raging battle against the Tangent Superman weakens him, allowing him to be ultimately defeated by his wife, concluding the story.\n\n===''Convergence'' (2015)===\n''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' is a two-month weekly [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], published by [[DC Comics]], that ran from April 2015 to May 2015. ''Convergence'' spins out of the final issues of the weekly series, ''[[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2: World's End]]'' and ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]''. The story involves [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] trapping cities from various timelines and planets that have ended, transporting them in domes to a planet outside of time and space, and \"opening them for a great experiment to see what happens when all these folks meet.\" Notable during this event is the return of DC characters from before the 2011 \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline that led to the creation of ''[[The New 52]]'' Universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/dc-convergence-week-three-wolfman-teen-titans-wein-swamp-thing-tangent-justice-league-detroit/ |title='Convergence' Week 3: 'Teen Titans', 'Swamp Thing', And More |author=Andrew Wheeler |date=25 November 2014 |work=Comics Alliance |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085243/http://comicsalliance.com/dc-convergence-week-three-wolfman-teen-titans-wein-swamp-thing-tangent-justice-league-detroit/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Interactions with the main DC Universe==\n''[[The Kingdom (comic book)|The Kingdom]]'' (1998) revealed that the Tangent Universe was part of [[Hypertime]], a fluid system of alternate realities based on splitting and re-merging timelines. Regular DC characters became aware of the Tangent Universe, but did not interact with it.\n\n''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2006) identified the Tangent Universe as ''Earth-97'', part of the recreated [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. As Earth-97 was being destroyed in the chaos, Green Lantern said that the heroes had to follow her lantern's light in order to survive. At the end of the story on New Earth, two children found the lantern belonging to the Tangent Universe's Green Lantern washed up on a beach.\n\nThe Tangent Universe's Green Lantern, Flash and Atom appeared in ''[[Ion (comics)|Ion]]'' #9-10 (2007), in which they displaced Ion and the two children who had found the lantern. Ion found himself in [[the Bleed]], where he encountered [[Captain Atom]]. Upon returning to Earth, Ion defeated the Tangent heroes, apparently by sending them back to their native dimension. During this appearance, everything said by the Tangent heroes was a repeat of lines from the original Tangent comics run.\n\nThe Tangent Universe's Green Lantern later appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #50, where she fled to New Earth in order to warn its heroes of an impending attack by the [[Crime Syndicate of Amerika]]. During the issue, it was revealed that the Syndicate members had ravaged the Tangent Earth and killed many of its heroes in the process. The Tangent Green Lantern later became instrumental in the ensuing battle by temporarily resurrecting [[Alexander Luthor]], and by the end of the story, the Tangent Universe had been restored to its former state.\n\n===Earth-9===\nThe \"History of the Multiverse\" backup stories in the 2007-2008 series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' established that the Tangent Universe now exists as one of the new 52 alternate universes. DC's official list of the current known multiverse lists the Tangent Universe as ''Earth-9''.\n\n==Trade paperbacks==\nDC Comics began reprinting the Tangent Comics one-shots in 2007 with a series of trade paperbacks.\n\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 1'' (August 2007), 208 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Atom'', ''Metal Men'', ''The Flash'', ''Green Lantern'' and ''Sea Devils'' one-shots.\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 2'' (January 2008), 192 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Joker'', ''Nightwing'', ''Batman'', ''Secret Six'' and ''Doom Patrol'' one-shots.\n*''Tangent Comics Volume 3'' (June 2008), 208 pages collecting the ''Tangent Comics: The Superman'', ''Wonder Woman'', ''The Joker's Wild'', ''JLA'', ''Tales of the Green Lantern'', ''Power Girl'', ''Nightwing: Nightforce'', and ''Trials of the Flash'' one-shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/12/12/dcs-collected-editions-mayjune-08/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712190203/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/12/12/dcs-collected-editions-mayjune-08/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=THE BEAT \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb DC\u2019s Collected Editions \u2014 May/June \u201808 |publisher=Pwbeat.publishersweekly.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref>\n*''Tangent: Superman's Reign Volume 1'', 160 pages collecting #1\u20136 and ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #16\n*''Tangent: Superman's Reign Volume 2'', 144 pages collecting #7\u201312\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing09/ccabana.shtml Superman and Batman in Tangent Comics]\n*[http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/tangent.html The Flash in Tangent Comics]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=imprint|id=8|title=Tangent (DC Comics)}}\n\n{{DC Comics imprints}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics imprints]]\n[[Category:1997 in comics]]\n[[Category:1998 in comics]]\n[[Category:Comics by Andy Lanning]]\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Jurgens]]\n[[Category:Comics by John Ostrander]]\n[[Category:Comics by Kurt Busiek]]\n[[Category:Comics by Mark Millar]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toWildcat (disambiguation)(link changed toWildcat (DC Comics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_Comics"}

The contest, organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (also known as EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition.\n\nParticipation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU.

A record 43 countries participated in 2008, 2011 and 2018. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible get the chance to compete.

After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more Eastern European countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.\n\nIn 2003, three countries applied to make their debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries.<ref>ESCtoday.com (27 November 2002).

The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] countries of the [[First World|west]]. [[Valery Leontyev]] was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nnm.ru/blogs/korova2007/neveroyatno_leontev_dolzhen_byl_predstavlyat_sssr_na_evrovidenie-87_2/ |script-title=ru:\u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e! \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u043d\u0430 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435-87! |publisher=nnm.ru |language=Russian |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528205339/http://nnm.ru/blogs/korova2007/neveroyatno_leontev_dolzhen_byl_predstavlyat_sssr_na_evrovidenie-87_2/ |archive-date=28 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSome former [[republics of the Soviet Union]], which were geographically situated in Europe, would later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Russia]], [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonia]], [[Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lithuania]], [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Latvia]], [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ukraine]], [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belarus]], [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest|Moldova]], [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]], [[Georgia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|Azerbaijan]], except [[Kazakhstan in the Eurovision Song Contest|Kazakhstan]], with five of the countries going on to win one of the contests: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Azerbaijan]].

Winners of the contest have come from twenty-seven of these countries. The contest, organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (also known as EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition.\n\nParticipation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]], or be in a [[Council of Europe]] member country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Admission |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |url=https://www.ebu.ch/about/members/admission |website=EBU |access-date=12 April 2017}}</ref> Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the \"Euro\" in \"Eurovision\", nor does it have a direct connection with the [[European Union]]. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus, and Armenia, in Western Asia, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 competition]] alone; and Australia making a debut in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 contest]]. In addition, several [[List of countries spanning more than one continent|transcontinental countries]] with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]]; Russia, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]]; Georgia, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]]; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 edition]]. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The [[Persian Gulf]] state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition.<ref name=\"Qatar\" /> However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, has participated every year since making its debut in 2015.\n\nThe number of countries participating each year has grown steadily, from seven in 1956 to over twenty in the late 1980s. A record 43 countries participated in 2008, 2011 and 2018. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible get the chance to compete. In 1993, a preliminary show, ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]'' (\"Qualification for Millstreet\"), was held to select three Eastern European countries to compete for the first time at the main Contest.<ref>ESCtoday.com.

Yugoslavia will become the only socialist country to participate in the following three decades. In 1970, a Nordic-led boycott of the contest reduced the number of countries entering to twelve.<ref>Eurovision.tv.

Retrieved on 9 February 2008.</ref> By the late 1980s, over twenty countries had become standard.\n\nIn 1993, the collapse of the [[USSR]] in Eastern Europe gave many new countries the opportunity to compete. Three countries\u2014Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics\u2014won through from a [[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet|pre-qualifier]] to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more Eastern European countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.\n\nIn 2003, three countries applied to make their debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries.<ref>ESCtoday.com (27 November 2002).

The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that they were interested in becoming active members of the Union, which would allow the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated that they hope to join Eurovision by 2011. [[Qatar]] first became involved in the Contest at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 edition]], where the broadcaster sent a delegation to the contest and broadcast a weekly radio show called '12pointsqatar' dedicated to Eurovision, which received favourable responses and has initiated the further involvement of Qatar in Eurovision. Qatar Radio has said that they feel that they would be happy to join all other competitors in the contest, including [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] if Qatar receives a membership.\n\nQatar is required to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU in order to have a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the [[European Broadcasting Area]] and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership, with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be [[Qatar Television]] (QTV) also owned and run by the [[Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation]] (QGBTC).

In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]], revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the Soviet Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due to the number of political reforms made by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] countries of the [[First World|west]]. [[Valery Leontyev]] was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nnm.ru/blogs/korova2007/neveroyatno_leontev_dolzhen_byl_predstavlyat_sssr_na_evrovidenie-87_2/ |script-title=ru:\u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e! \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u043d\u0430 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435-87! |publisher=nnm.ru |language=Russian |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528205339/http://nnm.ru/blogs/korova2007/neveroyatno_leontev_dolzhen_byl_predstavlyat_sssr_na_evrovidenie-87_2/ |archive-date=28 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSome former [[republics of the Soviet Union]], which were geographically situated in Europe, would later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Russia]], [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonia]], [[Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lithuania]], [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Latvia]], [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ukraine]], [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belarus]], [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest|Moldova]], [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]], [[Georgia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|Azerbaijan]], except [[Kazakhstan in the Eurovision Song Contest|Kazakhstan]], with five of the countries going on to win one of the contests: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Azerbaijan]].

However, it was decided that the BBC would continue to send one entry for the whole of the United Kingdom. Despite this, C\u00e2n i Gymru has been broadcast every year since, with the exception of 1973. The winning song takes part in the annual [[Pan Celtic Festival]] in Ireland.

Blish too eventually gives his life serving the Corps and Arisia is selected as his replacement on her next birthday, making her at least the fifth member of the family to serve as a Green Lantern.<ref name=\"tales3\">''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #3 (July 2009)</ref> Originally, Arisia is depicted as assuming the role of Green Lantern while still a teenager.\n\nArisia first appears in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #1 (May 1981) as part of a large group of [[Green Lantern]]s sent to thwart [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and [[Nekron]]. She, [[Katma Tui]], [[Salaak]], [[Ch'p (comics)|Ch'p]] (who refers to her as the \"big cutie\"), and [[Kilowog]] all relocate to Earth after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Once there, she adopts the secret identity of '''Cindy Simpson''', and redesigns the uniforms of the team to better reflect their individual personalities. Arisia is first shown as having a huge crush on [[Hal Jordan]], the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, who ultimately reciprocates her feelings. After being stationed on Earth with Jordan and confronted with their age difference she subconsciously uses her power ring to age herself so that she and Jordan can be together.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' #210-213</ref> Later, Arisia is among several Green Lanterns to lose their powers due to a disruption in the Main Battery on the planet [[Oa]] (the source from which the Green Lanterns draw their power). However, Arisia decides to remain on Earth with her boyfriend Hal and pursue a modeling career. Their relationship becomes strained as they adjust to the changes affecting the Corps, which eventually leads to them breaking up.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\n===Powerless===\nAfter her break-up with Hal Jordan, who she had slept with multiple times, Arisia begins developing her friendship with Kilowog. During one visit, an accidental blow to the head causes her to suffer from memory loss and triggers a return to her 13-year-old mentality. She seeks out the only person she believes can help her: Hal Jordan. She returns to Ferris Aircraft, desperate to find Jordan, and (following an attack by the [[New Guardians|New Guardian]] [[Floronic Man|Floro]]) is reunited with him. After a short time, her memories slowly begin to return, yet she still is not ready for the responsibility of being a Green Lantern again. Though she initially offers to return to the Corps as Hal's back-up, like Guy Gardner and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the idea is rejected.\n\nOver time, her memories return completely, and she seeks Guy Gardner's help in finding the missing Kilowog. Arisia offers to go to Oa with Gardner and the [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]], as her knowledge of Oa would be an asset to the group. Gardner turns her down due to her lack of powers being more hindrance than a help. After her rejection, Arisia returns armed to the teeth and demands to join them. On Oa, they discover the skeletal remains of Kilowog and are attacked by Hal Jordan.  She survives the attack and, upon returning to Earth, begins working at Gardner's new bar: ''Warrior's''.

Once there, she adopts the secret identity of '''Cindy Simpson''', and redesigns the uniforms of the team to better reflect their individual personalities. Arisia is first shown as having a huge crush on [[Hal Jordan]], the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, who ultimately reciprocates her feelings. After being stationed on Earth with Jordan and confronted with their age difference she subconsciously uses her power ring to age herself so that she and Jordan can be together.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' #210-213</ref> Later, Arisia is among several Green Lanterns to lose their powers due to a disruption in the Main Battery on the planet [[Oa]] (the source from which the Green Lanterns draw their power).

She returns to Ferris Aircraft, desperate to find Jordan, and (following an attack by the [[New Guardians|New Guardian]] [[Floronic Man|Floro]]) is reunited with him. After a short time, her memories slowly begin to return, yet she still is not ready for the responsibility of being a Green Lantern again. Though she initially offers to return to the Corps as Hal's back-up, like Guy Gardner and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the idea is rejected.\n\nOver time, her memories return completely, and she seeks Guy Gardner's help in finding the missing Kilowog. Arisia offers to go to Oa with Gardner and the [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]], as her knowledge of Oa would be an asset to the group. Gardner turns her down due to her lack of powers being more hindrance than a help. After her rejection, Arisia returns armed to the teeth and demands to join them.
