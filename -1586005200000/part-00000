An expanded re-release of the game featuring new and additional content, '''''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix''''', was released exclusively in Japan in March 2007.

Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via [[cutscene]]s, though there are numerous [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]] available that provide bonuses to characters.\n\nLike many traditional [[role-playing video game]]s, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' features an [[experience point]] system which determines character development.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\">{{cite book|last=Hollinger|first=Elizabeth|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0526-4}}</ref> As enemies are defeated, the player and allies culminate experience to \"level up\", in which the [[player character|playable characters]] grow stronger and gain access to new [[Skill (role-playing games)|abilities]].<ref name=\"Instructions\">{{cite book|author=[[Square Enix]]|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Square Enix]]}}</ref>\n\nCombat in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' is in real-time and involves heavy [[hack and slash]] elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, similar to those found in ''Final Fantasy'' games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/> A new feature is the \"Reaction Command\", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/ps2/19829/Kingdom-Hearts-II/review/|title=Kingdom Hearts II|publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat.<ref name=\"EuroGamerReview1\"/> Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.\n\nIn response to criticism, the \"Gummi Ship\" feature of the first game was re-imagined to be \"more enjoyable\". Although retaining its basic purpose of travel, the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of [[rail shooter]] and \"Disney theme park ride\".<ref name=\"KH-NI-1UP2005\"/> In the world map, the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down view]] and fly to the world the player wishes to enter.

The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes, which is also a new feature from the first game.\n\n===Drive Gauge===\nOne of the new features is a meter known as the \"Drive Gauge\". The Drive Gauge has dual functions: to transform Sora into a \"Drive Form\" or to summon a special character.

When a Drive is executed, Sora's combat statistics are heightened. Drive Forms also give Sora new abilities that can be used in normal form, called \"Growth Abilities.\" Sora's first two Drive Forms only combine power with one party member; later-obtained Drive Forms require him to bond with both party members. When allies are used in a Drive, they are temporarily removed from battle for its duration. Unlike the [[Health (game mechanic)|HP]] and [[magic (gaming)|MP]] gauges, the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/>\n\nLike in the first game, Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\"/> Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria.

The game's setting is a collection of various [[level (video games)|levels]] (referred to in-game as \"worlds\") that the player progresses through. As in the first game, the player can travel to various Disney-based locales, along with original worlds specifically created for the series. While Disney-based worlds were primarily derived from the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]] in the first game, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' introduces worlds that are based on live-action franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' as well.<ref name=\"liveworlds\">{{cite web|date=June 8, 2005 |title=Tetsuya Nomura Dengeki Interview #3 |url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/dengeki-3 |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611213907/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FDengeki-3 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"KH-NI-PSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/playstation |title=Playstation.com Europe\u2014E3 Interview |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=June 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418212412/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FPlaystation |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney film on which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately; with few exceptions, players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.\n\nSome worlds featured in the previous games reappear, but with new and expanded areas. There are also new worlds that are introduced, including the Land of Dragons (based on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''), Beast's Castle (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), Timeless River (''[[Steamboat Willie]]''), Port Royal (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), Pride Lands (''[[The Lion King]]''), and Space Paranoids (''[[Tron]]''). Twilight Town, an original world first seen in ''Chain of Memories'', has a greater role as the introductory world. The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n===Characters===\n{{further|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}\nThe three [[protagonist]]s of the game are [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], a 15-year-old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade, a mystical key-shaped weapon that can combat darkness; [[Donald Duck]], the court magician of Disney Castle; and [[Goofy]], the captain of the Disney Castle guards.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> Both Donald and Goofy are under orders from their missing king, [[Mickey Mouse]], to accompany Sora and his Keyblade.<ref name=\"MickeyNote\"/> which refers to Sora and his Keyblade. Other original characters include [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] and [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]], Sora's friends from his home world of [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Destiny Islands]]; [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]], a boy who can also wield the Keyblade and is playable in the game's beginning sequence; [[Namin\u00e9]], a girl with the power to manipulate memories; and [[DiZ]], a man in red robes with a vendetta against [[Organization XIII]], who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise, the mentor of [[Xehanort]].\n\nAs in the previous games, there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works. While some make a return from ''Kingdom Hearts'', new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced, such as [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] from ''The Lion King'' and [[Scrooge McDuck]]. [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] appears as a persistent enemy who works with the resurrected [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]. Nearly twenty characters from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games appear, notably [[\u0100ron|Auron]] of ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', [[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and the return of [[Squall Leonhart]], [[Cloud Strife|Cloud]], and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. It was stated that although the first game strictly stuck to characters [[Tetsuya Nomura]] designed, this time around they were going to \"take some risks\", implying that characters not directly designed by Nomura might make an appearance.<ref>{{cite web| first = Bryan| last = Boulette| url = http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| publisher = RPGamer| title = Nomura Divulges Kingdom Hearts II Details| accessdate = May 29, 2007| date = November 27, 2005| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030420/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| archivedate = September 30, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Other new characters to series are [[Vivi (Final Fantasy)|Vivi]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', [[Seifer Almasy]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''  and [[Setzer Gabbiani|Setzer]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''.\n\nThe various worlds that Sora explores often have an optional party character from the film on which the world is based. Such party members include [[Fa Mulan]], the woman who passes as a man in order to take her ailing father's place in the army; [[Jack Sparrow]], a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship, the [[Black Pearl]]; [[Simba]], the self-exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land; and ''[[Tron (franchise)|Tron]]'', a security program in Hollow Bastion's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\nOrganization XIII, a group of powerful Nobodies\u2014the \"empty shells\" left over when a strong-hearted person becomes a Heartless\u2014introduced in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|Chain of Memories]]'', is established as the primary group of antagonists early on. [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xemnas|Xemnas]], the leader of Organization XIII, serves as the main antagonist and [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]] of the game. Villains unique to the worlds are still prevalent, and are often presented as challenges that Sora's group must overcome.\n\n===Story===\nSora, Donald, and Goofy have been in [[suspended animation]] for the past year to regain their lost memories. Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town created by DiZ to merge him with his original self to restore Sora's power.<ref name=\"half of one\"/> DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town to extract Roxas.

Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.<ref name=\"riku?\"/>\n\nSora travels to familiar and unfamiliar worlds, where he resolves several problems caused by Organization XIII, the Heartless, and various local villains. During a visit to Hollow Bastion, they reunite with Mickey, who explains that the Heartless \"Ansem\" they defeated is an imposter named Xehanort, whose Nobody, Xemnas, is the Organization's leader.<ref name=revelation1 /> The Organization also reveal that they seek the power of Kingdom Hearts, creating one from the hearts Sora has released from the Heartless with his Keyblade, to regain their lost hearts;<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix, [[Buena Vista Games]]|date=March 28, 2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=|level=Hollow Bastion|isolang=|quote='''Sa\u00efx''': Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts.

Sora revisits the worlds to solve lingering problems and new complications while seeking a path to Organization XIII's base of operations in the World That Never Was. Throughout his endeavors, Sora is secretly aided by a hooded figure whom Sora believes to be Riku.<ref name=\"riku?\" />\n\nFollowing a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a passageway to the World That Never Was through Twilight Town, where Axel sacrifices himself to give them safe passage. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless as a result of capturing Roxas. Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor.<ref name=revelation3 /> Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. Atop of the Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to fight them.

New voice actors included [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] and [[Jesse McCartney]] as Roxas, Iku Nakahara and [[Brittany Snow]] as Namin\u00e9, and [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]] and [[Christopher Lee]] as DiZ.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/><ref name=\"1upvoice\">{{cite web |title=Kingdom Hearts II Voices Announced |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147824 |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |work=[[1UP.com]] |author=Pinckard, Jane |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016050549/http://www.1up.com/news/kingdom-hearts-voices-announced |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Mulan, [[James Woods]] as Hades, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron, [[Chris Sarandon]] as Jack Skellington and [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/> Some voice actors from the related television series or [[direct-to-video]] sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as [[Robert Costanzo]] as Philoctetes rather than [[Danny DeVito]] or [[Cam Clarke]] as Simba instead of [[Matthew Broderick]]. Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by [[Billy Zane]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Lance Bass]], and [[Sean Astin]] respectively in the first game, were voiced by [[Richard Epcar]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Doug Erholtz]], [[George Newbern]], and [[Tate Donovan]] (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by [[Rachael Leigh Cook]].<ref name=\"1upvoice\"/>\n\n===Content editing===\n[[File:Xigbar gun comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Xigbar's [[telescopic sight]] view and his weapons were altered from the Japanese version (top) to the English version (bottom).]]\nBesides English translation and [[language localisation|localization]], the international version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes. The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] boss in the ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, [[Daisy Duck]] pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.\n\n[[Organization XIII#Xigbar|Xigbar]]'s [[telescopic sight]] was changed from a [[crosshair]] and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, which is used to shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun.  The death of Organization XIII member [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]] was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.\n\nPort Royal, based on ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', contains the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/698/698488p1.html| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts and Future Titles| publisher = IGN| first=Anoop|last=Gantayat|date=March 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.\n\n===Promotion===\nAn unlockable trailer in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' hinted at the possibility of a sequel.

The game is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', and like the original game, combines characters and settings from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films with those of Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. An expanded re-release of the game featuring new and additional content, '''''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix''''', was released exclusively in Japan in March 2007. The ''Final Mix'' version of the game was later re-mastered in high definition and released globally as a part of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix]]'' collection for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Kingdom Hearts II'' is the third game in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.

Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via [[cutscene]]s, though there are numerous [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]] available that provide bonuses to characters.\n\nLike many traditional [[role-playing video game]]s, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' features an [[experience point]] system which determines character development.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\">{{cite book|last=Hollinger|first=Elizabeth|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0526-4}}</ref> As enemies are defeated, the player and allies culminate experience to \"level up\", in which the [[player character|playable characters]] grow stronger and gain access to new [[Skill (role-playing games)|abilities]].<ref name=\"Instructions\">{{cite book|author=[[Square Enix]]|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Square Enix]]}}</ref>\n\nCombat in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' is in real-time and involves heavy [[hack and slash]] elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, similar to those found in ''Final Fantasy'' games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/> A new feature is the \"Reaction Command\", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/ps2/19829/Kingdom-Hearts-II/review/|title=Kingdom Hearts II|publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat.<ref name=\"EuroGamerReview1\"/> Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.\n\nIn response to criticism, the \"Gummi Ship\" feature of the first game was re-imagined to be \"more enjoyable\". Although retaining its basic purpose of travel, the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of [[rail shooter]] and \"Disney theme park ride\".<ref name=\"KH-NI-1UP2005\"/> In the world map, the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down view]] and fly to the world the player wishes to enter.

The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes, which is also a new feature from the first game.\n\n===Drive Gauge===\nOne of the new features is a meter known as the \"Drive Gauge\".

When a Drive is executed, Sora's combat statistics are heightened. Drive Forms also give Sora new abilities that can be used in normal form, called \"Growth Abilities.\" Sora's first two Drive Forms only combine power with one party member; later-obtained Drive Forms require him to bond with both party members. When allies are used in a Drive, they are temporarily removed from battle for its duration. Unlike the [[Health (game mechanic)|HP]] and [[magic (gaming)|MP]] gauges, the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/>\n\nLike in the first game, Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\"/> Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria.

The game's setting is a collection of various [[level (video games)|levels]] (referred to in-game as \"worlds\") that the player progresses through. As in the first game, the player can travel to various Disney-based locales, along with original worlds specifically created for the series. While Disney-based worlds were primarily derived from the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]] in the first game, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' introduces worlds that are based on live-action franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' as well.<ref name=\"liveworlds\">{{cite web|date=June 8, 2005 |title=Tetsuya Nomura Dengeki Interview #3 |url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/dengeki-3 |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611213907/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FDengeki-3 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"KH-NI-PSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/playstation |title=Playstation.com Europe\u2014E3 Interview |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=June 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418212412/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FPlaystation |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney film on which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately; with few exceptions, players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.\n\nSome worlds featured in the previous games reappear, but with new and expanded areas. There are also new worlds that are introduced, including the Land of Dragons (based on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''), Beast's Castle (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), Timeless River (''[[Steamboat Willie]]''), Port Royal (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), Pride Lands (''[[The Lion King]]''), and Space Paranoids (''[[Tron]]''). Twilight Town, an original world first seen in ''Chain of Memories'', has a greater role as the introductory world. The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n===Characters===\n{{further|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}\nThe three [[protagonist]]s of the game are [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], a 15-year-old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade, a mystical key-shaped weapon that can combat darkness; [[Donald Duck]], the court magician of Disney Castle; and [[Goofy]], the captain of the Disney Castle guards.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> Both Donald and Goofy are under orders from their missing king, [[Mickey Mouse]], to accompany Sora and his Keyblade.<ref name=\"MickeyNote\"/> which refers to Sora and his Keyblade. Other original characters include [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] and [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]], Sora's friends from his home world of [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Destiny Islands]]; [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]], a boy who can also wield the Keyblade and is playable in the game's beginning sequence; [[Namin\u00e9]], a girl with the power to manipulate memories; and [[DiZ]], a man in red robes with a vendetta against [[Organization XIII]], who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise, the mentor of [[Xehanort]].\n\nAs in the previous games, there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works. While some make a return from ''Kingdom Hearts'', new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced, such as [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] from ''The Lion King'' and [[Scrooge McDuck]].

Atop of the Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to fight them. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two become trapped in the realm of darkness, where they discover a portal to the realm of light in a bottled letter sent by Kairi, allowing them to return to the Destiny Islands and reunite with their friends.

New voice actors included [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] and [[Jesse McCartney]] as Roxas, Iku Nakahara and [[Brittany Snow]] as Namin\u00e9, and [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]] and [[Christopher Lee]] as DiZ.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/><ref name=\"1upvoice\">{{cite web |title=Kingdom Hearts II Voices Announced |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147824 |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |work=[[1UP.com]] |author=Pinckard, Jane |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016050549/http://www.1up.com/news/kingdom-hearts-voices-announced |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Mulan, [[James Woods]] as Hades, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron, [[Chris Sarandon]] as Jack Skellington and [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/> Some voice actors from the related television series or [[direct-to-video]] sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as [[Robert Costanzo]] as Philoctetes rather than [[Danny DeVito]] or [[Cam Clarke]] as Simba instead of [[Matthew Broderick]]. Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by [[Billy Zane]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Lance Bass]], and [[Sean Astin]] respectively in the first game, were voiced by [[Richard Epcar]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Doug Erholtz]], [[George Newbern]], and [[Tate Donovan]] (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by [[Rachael Leigh Cook]].<ref name=\"1upvoice\"/>\n\n===Content editing===\n[[File:Xigbar gun comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Xigbar's [[telescopic sight]] view and his weapons were altered from the Japanese version (top) to the English version (bottom).]]\nBesides English translation and [[language localisation|localization]], the international version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes. The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] boss in the ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, [[Daisy Duck]] pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.\n\n[[Organization XIII#Xigbar|Xigbar]]'s [[telescopic sight]] was changed from a [[crosshair]] and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, which is used to shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun.  The death of Organization XIII member [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]] was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.\n\nPort Royal, based on ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', contains the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/698/698488p1.html| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts and Future Titles| publisher = IGN| first=Anoop|last=Gantayat|date=March 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.\n\n===Promotion===\nAn unlockable trailer in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' hinted at the possibility of a sequel.
