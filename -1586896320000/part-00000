Since this date Gaelic Games have been a pillar in Ballinasloe\u2019s society. Since the games\u2019 inception its popularity in Ballinasloe has been integral to its success. The first football game in Ballinasloe GAA\u2019s successful history took place on 31 March 1893 in a field in Pollboy. The game was between Creagh and Ballinasloe, Ballinasloe was captained by Thomas Cunningham and Creagh by T.F Burke. Creagh came out on top in a low scoring game of 2-01 to 1 point. \n\nLate that year, June 1893, saw Ballinasloe fulfil another fixture where they were welcomed out to Kiltormer to take on Killoran in a Gaelic Football game under GAA rules.\n\nAs stated earlier, Ballinasloe's association with Gaelic games can be traced back beyond an inaugural meeting of the GAA which was held in Thurles on November 1st, 1884; on an earlier date in 1884 Killimor and the Dublin Metropolitan Hurling team played a hurling challenge in Ballinasloe and included in that Dublin team was Michael Cusack who, later in the same year, was to be a founder member of the Association. Nevertheless, by 1866, when several clubs in East Galway were affiliated to the GAA, there was no mention on Ballinasloe, probably for the reason that the main emphasis was on hurling and Ballinasloe, at this time, was not a hurling area. Records show that by 1889 Ballinasloe had a football club with J.F. Gibney as captain. Despite the Parnell crisis the Galway Football Championship for 1891 was played and Ballinasloe participated, playing Mountbellew in Ahascragh on May 24th of that year. In 1892 P.D.

Bond girls occasionally have names that are [[double entendre]]s or [[pun]]s, such as [[Pussy Galore]], [[Plenty O'Toole]], [[Xenia Onatopp]], or [[Holly Goodhead]].\n\nA '''Bond girl''' can also refer to an actress playing a Bond girl, such as [[Ursula Andress]], [[Honor Blackman]] or [[Eva Green]].\n\nThere is no set rule on what kind of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply there for her looks. There are female characters such as [[Judi Dench]]'s [[M (James Bond)|M]], and [[Camille Montes]], a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence not strictly Bond girls.{{sfn|J\u00fctting|2007|p=65}}{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=34}}{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=134}} However, it has been argued that M's pivotal role in the plot of ''[[Skyfall]]'' qualifies her as a Bond girl or Bond woman.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review |title=Skyfall \u2013 review |date=25 October 2012 |work=The Guardian |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13051#.VyyA2fmLRdh |title=Judi Dench: the ultimate Bond girl |last=Slater |first=Tom |date=2 November 2012 |website=spiked-online.com |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/09/skyfall_and_the_end_of_the_bond_girl_she_s_a_bond_woman_now.html |title=The End of the Bond Girl and the Rise of the Bond Woman |last=Rosenberg |first=Alyssa |date=9 November 2012 |website=slate.com |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==In novels==\n{{primary sources|date=February 2016}}\n{{synthesis|date=February 2016}}\nNearly all of [[Ian Fleming]]'s Bond novels and short stories include one or more female characters who can be said to qualify as Bond girls, most of whom have been adapted for the screen. While Fleming's Bond girls have some individual traits (at least in their literary forms), they also have a great many characteristics in common.<ref>For a general discussion of the characteristics of the Fleming Bond girl, see the relevant chapters of O. F. Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report'' (Signet, 1965).</ref> One of these is age: The typical Bond girl is in her early to mid-twenties, roughly ten years younger than Bond, who seems to be perennially in his mid-thirties.<ref>[[James Bond (literary character)#Background]]</ref> Examples include Solitaire (25),<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch10\">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 10.</ref> [[Tatiana Romanova]] (24),<ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch9\">Fleming, Ian, ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 9.</ref> [[Vivienne Michel|Vivienne \"Viv\" Michel]] (23),<ref name=\"Fleming-Spy-ch2\">Fleming, Ian, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2.</ref> and [[Kissy Suzuki]] (23).<ref name=\"Fleming-You-ch12\">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 12.</ref> The youngest Bond girl (though she and Bond do not sleep together) may be [[Gala Brand]];{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} she is named for the [[cruiser]] in which her father is serving at the time of her birth.<ref name=\"Fleming-Moonraker-ch16\">Fleming, Ian, ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 16.</ref> Bond's youngest sexual partner in the books is Mariko Ichiban, an 18-year-old masseuse in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The eldest Bond girls are [[Pussy Galore]], whom Bond speculates is in her early 30s, and 29-year-old [[Domino Vitali]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nBond girls conform to a fairly well-defined standard of beauty. They possess splendid figures and tend to dress in a slightly masculine, assertive fashion, wear little jewellery\u2014and that in a masculine cut\u2014wide leather belts, and square-toed leather shoes. (There is some variation in dress, though: Bond girls have made their initial appearances in evening wear, in [[bra]] and [[panties]] and, on occasion, naked.) Nearly all of them are [[White people|white]]; they often sport light though noticeable suntans (although a few, such as Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Pussy Galore, are not only tanless but remarkably pale<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch10\" /><ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch8\">''From Russia, With Love'', ch. 8</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17\">Fleming, Ian, Goldfinger (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 17.</ref>), and they generally use little or no makeup and no nail polish, also wearing their nails short.<ref>Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report''.</ref> Their hair may be any colour,<ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch8\" /><ref>Fleming, Ian, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch7\">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7.</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Casino-ch5\">Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5.</ref> though they typically wear it in a natural or casual cut that falls heavily to their shoulders. Their features, especially their eyes and mouths, are often widely spaced (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, [[Tiffany Case]], Tatiana Romanova, [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], Viv Michel, Mary Goodnight).<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> Their eyes are usually blue (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, [[Tracy Bond]], Mary Goodnight),<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (Glidrose, 1963), ch. 3; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> and sometimes this is true to an unusual and striking degree: Tiffany Case's eyes are [[chatoyance|chatoyant]], varying with the light from grey to grey-blue,<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch5\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5.</ref> while Pussy Galore has deep violet eyes, the only truly violet eyes that Bond had ever seen.<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17\" /> The first description of a Bond girl, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale's]]'' [[Vesper Lynd]], is almost a template for the typical dress as well as the general appearance of later Bond girls; she sports nearly all of the features discussed above.<ref name=\"Fleming-Casino-ch5\" /> In contrast, [[Domino Vitali|Dominetta \"Domino\" Vitali]] arguably departs to the greatest degree from the template, dressing in white leather [[doeskin]] sandals, appearing more tanned, sporting a soft [[Brigitte Bardot]] haircut, and giving no indication of widely spaced features.<ref name=\"Fleming-Thunderball-ch11\">Fleming, Ian, ''Thunderball'' (Glidrose, 1961), ch. 11</ref> (The departure may be due to the [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|unusual circumstances]] behind the writing of the novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', in which Domino appears.) Even Domino, however, wears rather masculine jewellery.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fleming |first=Ian |title=Thunderball |date=1961 |publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe best-known characteristic of Bond girls apart from their uniform beauty is their pattern of sexually suggestive names, such as Pussy Galore. Names with less obvious meanings are sometimes explained in the novels. While Solitaire's real name is Simone Latrelle, she is known as Solitaire because she excludes men from her life;<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch7\" /> Gala Brand, as noted above, is named for her father's cruiser, [[HMS Galatea (71)|HMS ''Galatea'']]; and Tiffany Case received her name from her father, who was so angry that she was not a boy that he gave her mother a thousand dollars and a compact from [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] and then walked out on her.<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch22\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 22.</ref> Fleming's penchant for double-entendre names began with the first Bond novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. Conjecture is widespread that the name of the Bond girl in that novel, \"Vesper Lynd,\" was intended to be a pun on \"West Berlin,\" signifying Vesper's divided loyalties as a double agent under Soviet control. Several Bond girls, however, have normal names (e.g. Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, Judy Havelock, Viv Michel, Tracy Bond [n\u00e9e Teresa Draco, aka Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMost Bond girls are apparently (and sometimes expressly) sexually experienced by the time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men\u2014until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was [[Types of rape#Group rape|gang-raped]] as a teenager;<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch8\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 8.</ref> Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance.<ref name=\"Fleming-DoctorNo-ch11\">Fleming, Ian, ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 11.</ref> Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle.<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23\">Fleming, Ian, ''Goldfinger'' (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 23.</ref> While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, \"They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone.\"<ref name=\"Fleming-You-ch14\">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 14.</ref> The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The clich\u00e9 reaches its most extreme level in ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]''. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, but at the end of the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, \"They told me you only liked women,\" she replies, \"I never met a man before.\"<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23\" />\n\nIn Fleming's novels, many Bond girls have some sort of independent job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work\u2014the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as [[Sexual objectification|sex objects]], they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films.\n\nMost of the novels focus on one particular romance, as some of them do not begin until well into the novel (''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' is a good example). However, several exceptions have been made: In ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'', the Masterton sisters are considered Bond girls (although Tilly is supposedly a lesbian), and after their deaths, [[Pussy Galore]] (also supposedly a lesbian) becomes the primary Bond girl. In ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', Bond romances first Patricia Fearing, then later [[Domino Vitali]]. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', Bond enters into a relationship and an eventual marriage with [[Tracy Bond|Teresa 'Tracy' di Vicenzo]], and sleeps with Ruby Windsor, a patient he meets in Blofeld's hideout while posing as a genealogist. In ''You Only Live Twice'', Bond mainly has a relationship with Kissy Suzuki, but also romances Mariko Ichiban, as well as another a girl.\n\nSeveral Bond girls have obvious signs of inner turmoil (Vesper Lynd or Vivienne Michel), and others have traumatic pasts.

The first was ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969), in which [[Tracy Bond|Countess Tracy di Vicenzo]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] at the story's end. The second was [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Eva Green]]) in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so that they can have a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy organisation [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation.

This is not always the case in the novels, which do sometimes make references to the Bond girls who have appeared in previous books. Tiffany Case and Honey Ryder are revealed to have married other men (in ''From Russia With Love'' and ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' respectively), and in ''Doctor No'', Bond briefly wonders about Solitaire. In ''[[Licence Renewed]]'' it is specifically noted in an epilogue that Bond and Lavender Peacock stopped seeing each other after a brief romance. A unique case is Mary Goodnight, who appears in the novels, ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'' as Bond's secretary, before becoming a full-fledged Bond girl in ''The Man With the Golden Gun''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Effect on career===\nThe role of a Bond girl, as it has evolved in the films, is typically a high-profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although a number of Bond girls were well-established beforehand. For instance, [[Diana Rigg]] and [[Honor Blackman]] were both cast as Bond girls after they had already become stars in the United Kingdom for their roles in the television series, ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. In addition, [[Halle Berry]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2002\u2014the award was presented to her while she was filming ''[[Die Another Day]]''. [[Teri Hatcher]] was already known for her role as Lois Lane in the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' before she was cast in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. A few years after playing a Bond girl, she became one of the most highly paid actresses on television, starring in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.  [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was an unknown when she was cast in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (the opening credits read \"Introducing Jane Seymour\"), later won an [[Emmy]] Award for playing [[Maria Callas]] in a TV movie and then became a household name playing the title role in her TV series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/03/403579972/from-bond-girl-to-medicine-woman-jane-seymours-big-break |title=From Bond Girl To Medicine Woman: Jane Seymour's Big Break |work=NPR.org |access-date=2017-09-29 |language=en}}</ref> [[Kim Basinger]] had perhaps the most successful post-Bond career. After her break-out role in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', Basinger went on to win an [[Academy Award]] for her performance in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' and to star in a number of blockbuster films, including ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', over the next two decades.\n[[File:KimRosamundBG.png|275px|thumb|right|[[Kim Basinger]], who played [[Domino Vitali|Domino Petachi]] in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983) and [[Rosamund Pike]], who played Miranda Frost in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).]]\n\n[[Albert R. Broccoli|Broccoli\u2019s]] original choice for the role of [[Domino Derval]] was [[Julie Christie]] following her performance in ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' in 1963. It seems he was disappointed when he met her so instead he considered [[Raquel Welch]] after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. Welch, however, was hired by [[Richard Zanuck]] of [[20th Century Fox]] to appear in the film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' the same year instead.<ref name=\"mi6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb |title=Production notes for Thunderball |publisher=MI6.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218123749/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb |archive-date=18 December 2007 |access-date=30 December 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> French actress [[Claudine Auger]] was ultimately cast in the role.

[[Lois Chiles]] is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of [[Holly Goodhead]], but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/3817/curse-of-the-bond-girl.phtml |title=Curse of the Bond Girl |date=25 April 2001 |publisher=Cinema.com |access-date=29 March 2012}}</ref> At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress [[Eva Green]] agreed to play the role of Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]'s [[Rising Star Award, BAFTA|Rising Star Award]] for her performance. [[Rosamund Pike]], who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''.\n\n===Multiple appearances===\nPrior to the series being rebooted in 2006 with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', Sylvia Trench was the only Bond girl character to appear in more than one film (''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' in 1963). She was meant to be Bond's regular girlfriend, but was dropped after her appearance in the second film.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. After the series was rebooted, Moneypenny was re-introduced in ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) as an agent assisting Bond in his mission and her characterisation was closer to that of a Bond girl; following her demotion at the end of ''Skyfall'' the character returned for the next film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), as M's personal assistant and the characterisation of Moneypenny was closer to that of the original series. [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]], who played Madeleine Swann in ''Spectre'', will reprise her role in ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020).\n\nIn the series of films, six actresses have made reappearances as different Bond girls: [[Martine Beswick]] and [[Nadja Regin]] both first appeared in ''From Russia with Love'', and then appeared in ''Thunderball'' and ''Goldfinger'' respectively. [[Maud Adams]] played Andrea Anders in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974) and the title character in ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983).\n\nIf the \"unofficial\" James Bond films, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', are included, several actresses have also been a Bond girl more than once: Ursula Andress in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Angela Scoular]] in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1969) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Valerie Leon]] in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) and ''Never Say Never Again''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==List of Bond girls==\n===Ian Fleming stories===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Title (publication date) || scope=\"col\"|Bond girl\n|-\n| ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953) || [[Vesper Lynd]]\n|-\n| ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954) || Simone \"Solitaire\" Latrelle\n|-\n| ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' (1955) || Gala Brand\n|-\n| ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1956) || [[Tiffany Case]]\n|-\n| ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]'' (1957) ||[[Tatiana Romanova|Corporal Tatiana Romanova]]\n|-\n| ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958) || [[Honeychile Rider]]\n|-\n| ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959) || {{unbulleted list|[[Pussy Galore]] | Jill Masterton | Tilly Masterton <!--- Please do not change it to Masterson, which is only in the film.

Bond girls occasionally have names that are [[double entendre]]s or [[pun]]s, such as [[Pussy Galore]], [[Plenty O'Toole]], [[Xenia Onatopp]], or [[Holly Goodhead]].\n\nA '''Bond girl''' can also refer to an actress playing a Bond girl, such as [[Ursula Andress]], [[Honor Blackman]] or [[Eva Green]].\n\nThere is no set rule on what kind of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply there for her looks. There are female characters such as [[Judi Dench]]'s [[M (James Bond)|M]], and [[Camille Montes]], a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence not strictly Bond girls.{{sfn|J\u00fctting|2007|p=65}}{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=34}}{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=134}} However, it has been argued that M's pivotal role in the plot of ''[[Skyfall]]'' qualifies her as a Bond girl or Bond woman.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Skyfall \u2013 review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review|accessdate=6 May 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Slater|first1=Tom|title=Judi Dench: the ultimate Bond girl|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13051#.VyyA2fmLRdh|website=spiked-online.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=2 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=The End of the Bond Girl and the Rise of the Bond Woman|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/09/skyfall_and_the_end_of_the_bond_girl_she_s_a_bond_woman_now.html|website=slate.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In novels==\n{{primary sources|date=February 2016}}\n{{synthesis|date=February 2016}}\nNearly all of [[Ian Fleming]]'s Bond novels and short stories include one or more female characters who can be said to qualify as Bond girls, most of whom have been adapted for the screen. While Fleming's Bond girls have some individual traits (at least in their literary forms), they also have a great many characteristics in common.<ref>For a general discussion of the characteristics of the Fleming Bond girl, see the relevant chapters of O. F. Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report'' (Signet, 1965).</ref> One of these is age: The typical Bond girl is in her early to mid-twenties, roughly ten years younger than Bond, who seems to be perennially in his mid-thirties.<ref>[[James Bond (literary character)#Background]]</ref> Examples include Solitaire (25),<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch10\">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 10.</ref> [[Tatiana Romanova]] (24),<ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch9\">Fleming, Ian, ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 9.</ref> [[Vivienne Michel|Vivienne \"Viv\" Michel]] (23),<ref name=\"Fleming-Spy-ch2\">Fleming, Ian, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2.</ref> and [[Kissy Suzuki]] (23).<ref name=\"Fleming-You-ch12\">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 12.</ref> The youngest Bond girl (though she and Bond do not sleep together) may be [[Gala Brand]];{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} she is named for the [[cruiser]] in which her father is serving at the time of her birth.<ref name=\"Fleming-Moonraker-ch16\">Fleming, Ian, ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 16.</ref> Bond's youngest sexual partner in the books is Mariko Ichiban, an 18-year-old masseuse in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The eldest Bond girls are [[Pussy Galore]], whom Bond speculates is in her early 30s, and 29-year-old [[Domino Vitali]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nBond girls conform to a fairly well-defined standard of beauty. They possess splendid figures and tend to dress in a slightly masculine, assertive fashion, wear little jewellery\u2014and that in a masculine cut\u2014wide leather belts, and square-toed leather shoes. (There is some variation in dress, though: Bond girls have made their initial appearances in evening wear, in [[bra]] and [[panties]] and, on occasion, naked.) Nearly all of them are [[White people|white]]; they often sport light though noticeable suntans (although a few, such as Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Pussy Galore, are not only tanless but remarkably pale<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch10\" /><ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch8\">''From Russia, With Love'', ch. 8</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17\">Fleming, Ian, Goldfinger (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 17.</ref>), and they generally use little or no makeup and no nail polish, also wearing their nails short.<ref>Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report''.</ref> Their hair may be any colour,<ref name=\"Fleming-Russia-ch8\" /><ref>Fleming, Ian, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch7\">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7.</ref><ref name=\"Fleming-Casino-ch5\">Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5.</ref> though they typically wear it in a natural or casual cut that falls heavily to their shoulders. Their features, especially their eyes and mouths, are often widely spaced (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, [[Tiffany Case]], Tatiana Romanova, [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], Viv Michel, Mary Goodnight).<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> Their eyes are usually blue (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, [[Tracy Bond]], Mary Goodnight),<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (Glidrose, 1963), ch. 3; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> and sometimes this is true to an unusual and striking degree: Tiffany Case's eyes are [[chatoyance|chatoyant]], varying with the light from grey to grey-blue,<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch5\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5.</ref> while Pussy Galore has deep violet eyes, the only truly violet eyes that Bond had ever seen.<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17\" /> The first description of a Bond girl, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale's]]'' [[Vesper Lynd]], is almost a template for the typical dress as well as the general appearance of later Bond girls; she sports nearly all of the features discussed above.<ref name=\"Fleming-Casino-ch5\"/> In contrast, [[Domino Vitali|Dominetta \"Domino\" Vitali]] arguably departs to the greatest degree from the template, dressing in white leather [[doeskin]] sandals, appearing more tanned, sporting a soft [[Brigitte Bardot]] haircut, and giving no indication of widely spaced features.<ref name=\"Fleming-Thunderball-ch11\">Fleming, Ian, ''Thunderball'' (Glidrose, 1961), ch. 11</ref> (The departure may be due to the [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|unusual circumstances]] behind the writing of the novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', in which Domino appears.) Even Domino, however, wears rather masculine jewellery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fleming|first1=Ian|title=Thunderball|date=1961|publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe best-known characteristic of Bond girls apart from their uniform beauty is their pattern of sexually suggestive names, such as Pussy Galore. Names with less obvious meanings are sometimes explained in the novels. While Solitaire's real name is Simone Latrelle, she is known as Solitaire because she excludes men from her life;<ref name=\"Fleming-Live-ch7\" /> Gala Brand, as noted above, is named for her father's cruiser, [[HMS Galatea (71)|HMS ''Galatea'']]; and Tiffany Case received her name from her father, who was so angry that she was not a boy that he gave her mother a thousand dollars and a compact from [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] and then walked out on her.<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch22\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 22.</ref> Fleming's penchant for double-entendre names began with the first Bond novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. Conjecture is widespread that the name of the Bond girl in that novel, \"Vesper Lynd,\" was intended to be a pun on \"West Berlin,\" signifying Vesper's divided loyalties as a double agent under Soviet control. Several Bond girls, however, have normal names (e.g. Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, Judy Havelock, Viv Michel, Tracy Bond [n\u00e9e Teresa Draco, aka Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMost Bond girls are apparently (and sometimes expressly) sexually experienced by the time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men\u2014until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was [[Types of rape#Group rape|gang-raped]] as a teenager;<ref name=\"Fleming-Diamonds-ch8\">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 8.</ref> Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance.<ref name=\"Fleming-DoctorNo-ch11\">Fleming, Ian, ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 11.</ref> Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle.<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23\">Fleming, Ian, ''Goldfinger'' (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 23.</ref> While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, \"They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone.\"<ref name=\"Fleming-You-ch14\">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 14.</ref> The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The clich\u00e9 reaches its most extreme level in ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]''. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, but at the end of the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, \"They told me you only liked women,\" she replies, \"I never met a man before.\"<ref name=\"Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23\" />\n\nIn Fleming's novels, many Bond girls have some sort of independent job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work\u2014the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as [[Sexual objectification|sex objects]], they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films.\n\nMost of the novels focus on one particular romance, as some of them do not begin until well into the novel (''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' is a good example). However, several exceptions have been made: In ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'', the Masterton sisters are considered Bond girls (although Tilly is supposedly a lesbian), and after their deaths, [[Pussy Galore]] (also supposedly a lesbian) becomes the primary Bond girl. In ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', Bond romances first Patricia Fearing, then later [[Domino Vitali]]. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', Bond enters into a relationship and an eventual marriage with [[Tracy Bond|Teresa 'Tracy' di Vicenzo]], and sleeps with Ruby Windsor, a patient he meets in Blofeld's hideout while posing as a genealogist. In ''You Only Live Twice'', Bond mainly has a relationship with Kissy Suzuki, but also romances Mariko Ichiban, as well as another a girl.\n\nSeveral Bond girls have obvious signs of inner turmoil (Vesper Lynd or Vivienne Michel), and others have traumatic pasts. Most Bond girls whose characters are allowed to develop in the course of the story are flawed, and several have unhappy sexual backgrounds (Honey Ryder, Pussy Galore, Tiffany Case, Vivienne Michel, and Kissy Suzuki, among others).\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe inspiration for all of Fleming's Bond girls may be his onetime lover Muriel Wright, who according to ''The Times''<ref name=\"macintyre20080405\">{{Cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3652410.ece |title=Was Ian Fleming the real 007? |last=Macintyre, Ben |date=5 April 2008 |work=The Times |access-date=8 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531130411/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3652410.ece |archive-date=31 May 2010 |location=London |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|has a claim to be the ''[[fons et origo]]'' of the species: pliant and undemanding, beautiful but innocent, outdoorsy, physically tough, implicitly vulnerable and uncomplaining, and then tragically dead, before or soon after marriage.}}\n\nWright was 26 and \"exceptionally beautiful\" when she and Fleming met in 1935.

The first was ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969), in which [[Tracy Bond|Countess Tracy di Vicenzo]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] at the story's end. The second was [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Eva Green]]) in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so that they can have a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy organisation [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation. She ends up actually falling in love with Bond, but dies, as Quantum is closing in on her, by drowning in a lift in a building under renovation in [[Venice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/eva-green-is-vesper-lynd-in-casino-royale/|title=Eva Green is Vesper Lynd in \u2018Casino Royale\u2019|publisher=Movie Web|date=12 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/spectre-james-bond-24-quantum-mr-white/|title=\u2018Quantum of Solace\u2019s Mr. White Says He\u2019s Returning for \u2018Spectre\u2019|website=Screen Rant|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of these two doomed Bond girls, it is never explained why Bond's love interest in one film is gone by the next, and is never mentioned or even alluded to again. This is not always the case in the novels, which do sometimes make references to the Bond girls who have appeared in previous books. Tiffany Case and Honey Ryder are revealed to have married other men (in ''From Russia With Love'' and ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' respectively), and in ''Doctor No'', Bond briefly wonders about Solitaire. In ''[[Licence Renewed]]'' it is specifically noted in an epilogue that Bond and Lavender Peacock stopped seeing each other after a brief romance. A unique case is Mary Goodnight, who appears in the novels, ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'' as Bond's secretary, before becoming a full-fledged Bond girl in ''The Man With the Golden Gun''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Effect on career===\nThe role of a Bond girl, as it has evolved in the films, is typically a high-profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although a number of Bond girls were well-established beforehand. For instance, [[Diana Rigg]] and [[Honor Blackman]] were both cast as Bond girls after they had already become stars in the United Kingdom for their roles in the television series, ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. In addition, [[Halle Berry]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2002\u2014the award was presented to her while she was filming ''[[Die Another Day]]''. [[Teri Hatcher]] was already known for her role as Lois Lane in the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' before she was cast in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. A few years after playing a Bond girl, she became one of the most highly paid actresses on television, starring in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.  [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was an unknown when she was cast in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (the opening credits read \"Introducing Jane Seymour\"), later won an [[Emmy]] Award for playing [[Maria Callas]] in a TV movie and then became a household name playing the title role in her TV series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/03/403579972/from-bond-girl-to-medicine-woman-jane-seymours-big-break|title=From Bond Girl To Medicine Woman: Jane Seymour's Big Break|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref> [[Kim Basinger]] had perhaps the most successful post-Bond career. After her break-out role in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', Basinger went on to win an [[Academy Award]] for her performance in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' and to star in a number of blockbuster films, including ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', over the next two decades.\n[[File:KimRosamundBG.png|275px|thumb|right|[[Kim Basinger]], who played [[Domino Vitali|Domino Petachi]] in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983) and [[Rosamund Pike]], who played Miranda Frost in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).]]\n\n[[Albert R. Broccoli|Broccoli\u2019s]] original choice for the role of [[Domino Derval]] was [[Julie Christie]] following her performance in ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' in 1963. It seems he was disappointed when he met her so instead he considered [[Raquel Welch]] after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. Welch, however, was hired by [[Richard Zanuck]] of [[20th Century Fox]] to appear in the film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' the same year instead.<ref name=\"mi6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb|title=Production notes for Thunderball|accessdate=30 December 2007|publisher=MI6.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218123749/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb|archivedate=18 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> French actress [[Claudine Auger]] was ultimately cast in the role.

[[Lois Chiles]] is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of [[Holly Goodhead]], but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/3817/curse-of-the-bond-girl.phtml |title=Curse of the Bond Girl |publisher=Cinema.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress [[Eva Green]] agreed to play the role of Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]'s [[Rising Star Award, BAFTA|Rising Star Award]] for her performance. [[Rosamund Pike]], who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''.\n\n===Multiple appearances===\nPrior to the series being rebooted in 2006 with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', Sylvia Trench was the only Bond girl character to appear in more than one film (''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' in 1963). She was meant to be Bond's regular girlfriend, but was dropped after her appearance in the second film.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. After the series was rebooted, Moneypenny was re-introduced in ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) as an agent assisting Bond in his mission and her characterisation was closer to that of a Bond girl; following her demotion at the end of ''Skyfall'' the character returned for the next film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), as M's personal assistant and the characterisation of Moneypenny was closer to that of the original series. [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]], who played Madeleine Swann in ''Spectre'', will reprise her role in ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020).\n\nIn the series of films, six actresses have made reappearances as different Bond girls: [[Martine Beswick]] and [[Nadja Regin]] both first appeared in ''From Russia with Love'', and then appeared in ''Thunderball'' and ''Goldfinger'' respectively. [[Maud Adams]] played Andrea Anders in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974) and the title character in ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983).\n\nIf the \"unofficial\" James Bond films, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', are included, several actresses have also been a Bond girl more than once: Ursula Andress in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Angela Scoular]] in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1969) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Valerie Leon]] in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) and ''Never Say Never Again''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==List of Bond girls==\n===Ian Fleming stories===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Title (publication date) || scope=\"col\"|Bond girl\n|-\n| ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953) || [[Vesper Lynd]]\n|-\n| ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954) || Simone \"Solitaire\" Latrelle\n|-\n| ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' (1955) || Gala Brand\n|-\n| ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1956) || [[Tiffany Case]]\n|-\n| ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]'' (1957) ||[[Tatiana Romanova|Corporal Tatiana Romanova]]\n|-\n| ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958) || [[Honeychile Rider]]\n|-\n| ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959) || {{unbulleted list|[[Pussy Galore]] | Jill Masterton | Tilly Masterton <!--- Please do not change it to Masterson, which is only in the film.
