The lavish, wooden 110-room home was destroyed by fire April 15, 1899, while his son,  [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]], was honeymooning there. Willie and his new wife escaped. It was rebuilt of red brick and gray stone, with exquisite furnishings, for $3 million. The building at the time was considered among the finest homes in America. His daughter [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Consuelo]] also honeymooned there when she married the [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] in 1895.\n\nAfter Vanderbilt's death in 1920, the mansion went through several phases and visitors, including a brief stay during Prohibition by gangster [[Dutch Schultz]]. Around that time, cow stalls, pig pens and corn cribs on the farm portion of Idle Hour were converted into a short-lived bohemian artists' colony that included figures such as [[George Elmer Browne]] and Roman Bonet-Sintas. The estate became home to Dowling College until it closed in August 2016.\n\n===Founding===\nIn 1955 [[Adelphi University|Adelphi College]] began offering extension classes in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], [[Riverhead (town), New York|Riverhead]], and [[Sayville, New York]]. In 1959 Adelphi Suffolk became the first four-year, degree-granting [[liberal arts]] institution in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], housed in an old public school building in [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]]. In January 1963, Adelphi purchased the former William K. Vanderbilt estate in Oakdale. Adelphi spun the campus off in 1968 as Dowling College, named after city planner and philanthropist [[Robert W. Dowling]], who provided an endowment of over $3 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=DOWLING ENDOWS A COLLEGE ON L.I.; Adelphi - Suffolk Will Be Named After Benefactor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/13/archives/dowling-endows-a-college-on-li-adelphi-suffolk-will-be-named-after.html|accessdate=November 12, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=June 13, 1968}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\nThe Racanelli Learning Resource Center was constructed in 1974 to house the library, cafeteria and additional classrooms.

The lavish, wooden 110-room home was destroyed by fire April 15, 1899, while his son,  [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]], was honeymooning there. Willie and his new wife escaped. It was rebuilt of red brick and gray stone, with exquisite furnishings, for $3 million. The building at the time was considered among the finest homes in America. His daughter [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Consuelo]] also honeymooned there when she married the [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] in 1895.\n\nAfter Vanderbilt's death in 1920, the mansion went through several phases and visitors, including a brief stay during Prohibition by gangster [[Dutch Schultz]]. Around that time, cow stalls, pig pens and corn cribs on the farm portion of Idle Hour were converted into a short-lived bohemian artists' colony that included figures such as [[George Elmer Browne]] and Roman Bonet-Sintas. The estate became home to Dowling College until it closed in August 2016.\n\n===Founding===\nIn 1955 [[Adelphi University|Adelphi College]] began offering extension classes in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], [[Riverhead (town), New York|Riverhead]], and [[Sayville, New York]].

In January 1963, Adelphi purchased the former William K. Vanderbilt estate in Oakdale. Adelphi spun the campus off in 1968 as Dowling College, named after city planner and philanthropist [[Robert W.

A month later, a fire damaged the Vanderbilt mansion. The Hunt Room, the Foyer and Ballroom were all substantially damaged. A College committee, led by Alan Fortunoff, Dowling Trustee and son of [[Fortunoff]] founder Max Fortunoff, guided the restoration of the ornate woodwork, precious marble, and the elaborately carved stonework.
