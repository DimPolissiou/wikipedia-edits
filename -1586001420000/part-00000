Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker '''Sly Tendencies''' when he started rapping, but soon changed his name when [[Tyler, the Creator]] invited him to join his [[music collective|alternative hip hop collective]] [[Odd Future]] in late 2009.\n\nHe gained recognition and critical praise for his debut [[mixtape]], ''[[Earl (mixtape)|Earl]]'', which released in March 2010 when he was just 16 years old. Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in [[Samoa]] for at-risk teens for a year and a half. He was unable to record music during his tenure there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday. Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut [[studio album]] ''[[Doris (album)|Doris]]'' in August 2013.\n\nHis second album, ''[[I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside]]'' followed in March 2015, and his third, ''[[Some Rap Songs]]'', released in November 2018. His projects have all received widespread critical praise. He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by [[Columbia Records]]. On November 1, 2019, Kgositsile released an EP titled ''[[Feet of Clay (EP)|Feet of Clay]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/feet-of-clay/1483686252|title=FEET OF CLAY by Earl Sweatshirt|last=|author=thebe|date=2019-11-01|website=iTunes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nThebe Neruda Kgositsile was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Cheryl Harris, a law professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]], a [[South Africa]]n poet and political activist.

Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker '''Sly Tendencies''' when he started rapping, but soon changed his name when [[Tyler, the Creator]] invited him to join his [[music collective|alternative hip hop collective]] [[Odd Future]] in late 2009.\n\nHe gained recognition and critical praise for his debut [[mixtape]], ''[[Earl (mixtape)|Earl]]'', which released in March 2010 when he was just 16 years old. Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in [[Samoa]] for at-risk teens for a year and a half. He was unable to record music during his tenure there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday. Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut [[studio album]] ''[[Doris (album)|Doris]]'' in August 2013.\n\nHis second album, ''[[I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside]]'' followed in March 2015, and his third, ''[[Some Rap Songs]]'', released in November 2018. His projects have all received widespread critical praise. He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by [[Columbia Records]]. On November 1, 2019, Kgositsile released an EP titled ''[[Feet of Clay (EP)|Feet of Clay]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/feet-of-clay/1483686252|title=FEET OF CLAY by Earl Sweatshirt|last=|author=thebe|date=2019-11-01|website=iTunes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nThebe Neruda Kgositsile was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Cheryl Harris, a law professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]], a [[South Africa]]n poet and political activist.

The  event offers a purse of $150,000 added.\n\n== History==\nThe race was first carded in its inaugural running in 1952. It became graded for the first time in 1973.<ref>2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 57 on March 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe race is part of a series of stakes races named for famous [[Maryland]]ers, in this case: [[Gallorette]], one of the great racing fillies in [[United States|American]] history. Named for Mrs. M. A. Moore's 1946 and 1947 Champion Handicap Female. Gallorete was famous for beating the males of her day in a number of races. Gallorette also won the 1945 Pimlico Oaks (the sister race to the Preakness Stakes) which was renamed later to the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Gallorette's own daughter, Mlle. Lorette, won this race in 1954.<ref>2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 57 on March 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe Gallorete Handicap's stakes record is 1:39.73 held by [[Miz Money]] who won the race in 2016.\n\nThe Gallorette was run on dirt between 1952-through-1972, in 1979 and 1980, 1984, 1986 and 1987 as well as 1995 and 1996.\n\n== Records ==\n'''Speed record: '''\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles - 1:40.32 - [[Precious Kitten]] (2007)\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles - 1:50.20 - Mlle.

The  event offers a purse of $150,000 added.\n\n== History==\nThe race was first carded in its inaugural running in 1952. It became graded for the first time in 1973.<ref>2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 57 on March 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe race is part of a series of stakes races named for famous [[Maryland]]ers, in this case: [[Gallorette]], one of the great racing fillies in [[United States|American]] history. Named for Mrs. M. A. Moore's 1946 and 1947 Champion Handicap Female. Gallorete was famous for beating the males of her day in a number of races. Gallorette also won the 1945 Pimlico Oaks (the sister race to the Preakness Stakes) which was renamed later to the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Gallorette's own daughter, Mlle. Lorette, won this race in 1954.<ref>2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 57 on March 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe Gallorete Handicap's stakes record is 1:39.73 held by [[Miz Money]] who won the race in 2016.\n\nThe Gallorette was run on dirt between 1952-through-1972, in 1979 and 1980, 1984, 1986 and 1987 as well as 1995 and 1996.\n\n== Records ==\n'''Speed record: '''\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles - 1:40.32 - [[Precious Kitten]] (2007)\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles - 1:50.20 - Mlle.
