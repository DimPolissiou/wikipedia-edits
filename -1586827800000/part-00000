He is also Professor (Emeritus) at Stanford University and National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo). \n\n== Biography ==\nYamamoto was born in [[Tokyo]] on November 21, 1950. In 1973 he received his B.S. degree from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]. He continued his studies at [[the University of Tokyo]] where he received his M.S. in 1975 and Ph.D. in 1978. From 1978 to 1992, he worked at NTT Basic Research Laboratories in Tokyo. Since 1992, he has been a professor of applied physics and electrical engineering at [[Stanford University]] in the United States and currently a professor (emeritus). Since 2003, he also has been a professor at [[National Institute of Informatics]] in Tokyo and currently a professor (emeritus). In 2019, he became a founding director of NTT PHI Labs in Silicon Valley, California, the United States.\n\n== Work ==\n\nYamamoto's scientific focuses in the 1980s were [[fiber-optic communication|coherent optical fiber communications]], photon number squeezing in semiconductor lasers, [[Quantum nondemolition measurement|quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements]] and other experimental [[Quantum optics| quantum optics]] subjects. One of Yamamoto's key works from this era is arguably the first proposal for how to physically realize photon number squeezing,<ref name=\"Yamamoto1986 Machida1987\"/> QND measurement<ref name=\"Imoto1985\"/> and a quantum computer.<ref name=\"qc1988\">K. Igeta and Y.

One highlight was the co-first demonstration (with [[Ata\u00e7 \u0130mamo\u011flu]]'s group at ETH) of entanglement between a spin in a quantum dot and a photon emitted by it.<ref name=\"DeGreve2012\"/> Work on exciton-polaritons continued. Since 2012, Yamamoto has studied the required number of physical qubits and expected computational time in quantum computer <ref name=\"Jones2012\"/> and pioneered the development of a novel quantum optical computer, called coherent Ising machine <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aah5178 | volume=354 | issue=6312 | title=A fully programmable 100-spin coherent Ising machine with all-to-all connections | year=2016 | journal=Science | pages=614\u2013617 | author=McMahon Peter L., Marandi Alireza, Haribara Yoshitaka, Hamerly Ryan, Langrock Carsten, Tamate Shuhei, Inagaki Takahiro, Takesue Hiroki, Utsunomiya Shoko, Aihara Kazuyuki, Byer Robert L., Fejer M.

He is also Professor (Emeritus) at Stanford University and National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo). \n\n== Biography ==\nYamamoto was born in [[Tokyo]] on November 21, 1950. In 1973 he received his B.S. degree from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]. He continued his studies at [[the University of Tokyo]] where he received his M.S. in 1975 and Ph.D. in 1978. From 1978 to 1992, he worked at NTT Basic Research Laboratories in Tokyo. Since 1992, he has been a professor of applied physics and electrical engineering at [[Stanford University]] in the United States and currently a professor (emeritus). Since 2003, he also has been a professor at [[National Institute of Informatics]] in Tokyo and currently a professor (emeritus). In 2019, he became a founding director of NTT PHI Labs in Silicon Valley, California, the United States.\n\n== Work ==\n\nYamamoto's scientific focuses in the 1980s were [[fiber-optic communication|coherent optical fiber communications]], [[squeezing|photon number squeezing in semiconductor lasers]], [[Quantum nondemolition measurement|quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements]] and other experimental [[Quantum optics| quantum optics]] subjects. One of Yamamoto's key works from this era is arguably the first proposal for how to physically realize photon number squeezing,<ref name=\"Yamamoto1986 Machida1987\"/> QND measurement<ref name=\"Imoto1985\"/> and a quantum computer.<ref name=\"qc1988\">K. Igeta and Y. Yamamoto. \"Quantum mechanical computers with single atom and photon fields.\" International Quantum Electronics Conference (1988) https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=IQEC-1988-TuI4</ref> His most prominent work in the 1990s is in semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics<ref name=\"Yamamoto book\"/> (especially involving microcavities and quantum wells) and quantum transport effects in mesoscopic devices.<ref name=\"Oliver1999\"/>\n\nDuring the 2000s, his most important work was on the development of optically-active quantum dots as a platform for quantum information processing (both as single-photon sources for quantum cryptography,<ref name=\"Santori2002\"/><ref name=\"Benson2000\"/> and as hosts for spin qubits.<ref name=\"Press2008\"/><ref name=\"DeGreve2012\"/> His another important work was on exciton-polariton condensation effects.<ref name=\"Deng2002\"/><ref name=\"Deng2010\"/> Yamamoto was also active in the development of security theory and realization of quantum key distribution protocols.<ref name=\"Inoue2002\"/><ref name=\"Takesue2007\"/> Landmark papers from this era include the demonstration of indistinguishable photons from a single quantum dot;<ref name=\"Santori2002\"/> the proposal for biexciton cascade as a method for generating entangled photons (for QKD) from a single quantum dot <ref name=\"Benson2000\"/> (this is the proposal underlying essentially all QD entangled-photon sources, such as those reviewed in <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2007.46 | volume=1 | issue=4 | title=Semiconductor quantum light sources | year=2007 | journal=Nature Photonics | pages=215\u2013223 | author=Shields Andrew J| arxiv=0704.0403 | bibcode=2007NaPho...1..215S }}</ref>), and control of a single spin qubit in a quantum dot using optical pulses.<ref name=\"Press2008\"/>\n\nDuring the 2010s, his work has continued on exploring quantum dots as a platform for building both quantum repeaters and quantum computers. One highlight was the co-first demonstration (with [[Ata\u00e7 \u0130mamo\u011flu]]'s group at ETH) of entanglement between a spin in a quantum dot and a photon emitted by it.<ref name=\"DeGreve2012\"/> Work on exciton-polaritons continued. Since 2012, Yamamoto has studied the required number of physical qubits and expected computational time in quantum computer <ref name=\"Jones2012\"/> and pioneered the development of a novel quantum optical computer, called coherent Ising machine <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aah5178 | volume=354 | issue=6312 | title=A fully programmable 100-spin coherent Ising machine with all-to-all connections | year=2016 | journal=Science | pages=614\u2013617 | author=McMahon Peter L., Marandi Alireza, Haribara Yoshitaka, Hamerly Ryan, Langrock Carsten, Tamate Shuhei, Inagaki Takahiro, Takesue Hiroki, Utsunomiya Shoko, Aihara Kazuyuki, Byer Robert L., Fejer M.

The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the na\u00efve teenager, and the precocious child.\n\nThe costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Munsters characters}}\n\n===Regulars===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:55%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n|-\n| [[Fred Gwynne]]\n| [[Herman Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Yvonne De Carlo]]\n| [[Lily Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]\n| [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]]\n|-\n| [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]] \n| [[Marilyn Munster]] (ep. 14\u201370)\n|-\n| [[Beverley Owen]] \n| [[Marilyn Munster]] (ep. 1\u201313)\n|-\n| [[Butch Patrick]]\n| [[Eddie Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Mel Blanc]]\n| The Raven\n|-\n| [[Bob Hastings]]\n| The Raven\n|}\n\n===Recurring guests===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:55%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n|-\n| [[Paul Lynde]] \n| Edward H.

The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.\n\n===Filming===\nOriginally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.\n\n===Sets===\n{{Main|Munster Mansion}}\nWhile its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.\n\n[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]\nThe Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979\u201380) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].\n[[File:Munsterkoach.JPG|thumb|right|The Munster Koach]]\n\n===Props===\nIn the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].\n\nButch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pitch episode===\n[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]\nThe first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin.

The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs. It was also decided that Joan Marshall looked too much like [[Morticia Addams]]<ref name=\"Biography\"/> and that Happy Derman was too nasty as Eddie, so both were replaced.<ref name=\"Biography\">[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], \"The Munsters,\" 1998</ref> On the basis of the first presentation, the new series, still not completely cast, was announced by CBS on February 18, 1964. A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].\n\n===1965 Easter special===\nDuring season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie.

When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.\n\nOther merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.\n\nA video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".\n\nThe first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.\n\n[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire films]]\n*[[List of vampire television series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]].

The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the na\u00efve teenager, and the precocious child.\n\nThe costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Munsters characters}}\n\n===Regulars===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:65%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n|-\n| [[Fred Gwynne]]\n| [[Herman Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Yvonne De Carlo]]\n| [[Lily Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]\n| [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]]\n|-\n| [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]] \n| [[Marilyn Munster]] (ep. 14\u201370)\n|-\n| [[Beverley Owen]] \n| [[Marilyn Munster]] (ep. 1\u201313)\n|-\n| [[Butch Patrick]]\n| [[Eddie Munster]]\n|-\n| [[Mel Blanc]]\n| The Raven\n|-\n| [[Bob Hastings]]\n| The Raven\n|}\n\n===Recurring guests===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:55%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n|-\n| [[Paul Lynde]] \n| Edward H.

The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.\n\n===Filming===\nOriginally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.\n\n===Sets===\n{{Main|Munster Mansion}}\nWhile its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.\n\n[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]\nThe Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979\u201380) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].\n[[File:Munsterkoach.JPG|thumb|right|The Munster Koach]]\n\n===Props===\nIn the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].\n\nButch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pitch episode===\n[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]\nThe first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin. The biggest character difference was that Eddie was portrayed by Derman as a nasty brat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=36, 38}}</ref>\n\nThe title sequence had light, happy music (picked up from the [[Doris Day]] movie ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'')<ref name=\"Biography\"/> instead of the more hip [[surf music|surf]] theme that was to come. The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs. It was also decided that Joan Marshall looked too much like [[Morticia Addams]]<ref name=\"Biography\"/> and that Happy Derman was too nasty as Eddie, so both were replaced.<ref name=\"Biography\">[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], \"The Munsters,\" 1998</ref> On the basis of the first presentation, the new series, still not completely cast, was announced by CBS on February 18, 1964. A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].\n\n===1965 Easter special===\nDuring season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie. Shot on videotape, it aired just once on CBS on April 18, and was long thought [[lost television broadcast|lost]] until a copy was donated to the Paley Center in New York in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title= Munsterland|url= http://www.munsterland.net/marineland.html|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Pop Colorture|url=http://pop-colorture.com/2016/10/30/trick-or-treat-the-munsters-scare-up-some-fun-in-this-newly-discovered-holiday-special/|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Episode list===\n{{Main|List of The Munsters episodes}}\n{{:List of The Munsters episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nReruns of this series aired on [[Nick at Nite]] in the 1990s.

When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.\n\nOther merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.\n\nA video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".\n\nThe first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.\n\n[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire films]]\n*[[List of vampire television series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]].
