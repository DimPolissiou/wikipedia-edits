See [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \nDepending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact to textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''.\n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of ''Tanakh'' and Jewish philosophy at these will typically be text-focused, built around ''[[chavruta]]''-based study as at yeshivot;\nthis entails paired-study where assigned sources are prepared for [[shiur]] (lecture).\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensely\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied with ''practice'' in view: i.e., as opposed to [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|at a men's Yeshiva]], where the derivation is from Talmudic sources through codification \n(At [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] the treatment is Talmud-based.)\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned seminaries - for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]] - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]].\nThese are typically more conservative in their approach:\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes - particular philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills, with content delivered primarily via lecture\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]]).\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nHaredi and Hasidic schools often also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]], covering topics such as [[Tzniut]], [[Shalom Bayit]] and [[Chinuch]], with these classes emphasizing ''values'' as opposed to sources. \n\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the midrasha-affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \n([[masters degree|masters' level]]) specializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. See also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school, for example [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' also accommodate [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]]; well known are [[Neve Yerushalayim]], [[Mayanot]], and [[Machon Roni]].\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges; see [[Yeshiva #College credit]]. \nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously.\nThe Modern Orthodox [[Stern College for Women]] - in Manhattan, New York - combines Torah and University studies, as at Bar-Ilan;\nthe Haredi [[Touro_College_and_University_System#Undergraduate_schools|Lander College for Women]] similarly.\n<!-- \n==Coed high school Midrashot==\nWhile a [[Hebrew school]] program typically handles [[Jewish education]] for youths before their [[Bar/Bat Mitzvah]], students who wish to continue their Jewish education through high school enroll in a Midrasha.\n -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beis Yaakov]]\n* [[List of Midrashot]]\n* [[Women in Judaism]] and esp.

See [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \nDepending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact to textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''.\n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of ''Tanakh'' and Jewish philosophy at these will typically be text-focused, built around ''[[chavruta]]''-based study as at yeshivot;\nthis entails paired-study where assigned sources are prepared for [[shiur]] (lecture).\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensely\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied with ''practice'' in view: i.e., as opposed to [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|at a men's Yeshiva]], where the derivation is from Talmudic sources through codification \n(At [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] the treatment is Talmud-based.)\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned seminaries - for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]] - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]].\nThese are typically more conservative in their approach:\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes - particular philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills, with content delivered primarily via lecture\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]]).\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nHaredi and Hasidic schools often also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]], covering topics such as [[Tzniut]], [[Shalom Bayit]] and [[Chinuch]], with these classes emphasizing ''values'' as opposed to sources. \n\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the midrasha-affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \n([[masters degree|masters' level]]) specializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. See also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school, for example [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' also accommodate [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]]; well known are [[Neve Yerushalayim]], [[Mayanot]], and [[Machon Roni]].\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges; see [[Yeshiva #College credit]]. \nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously.\nThe Modern Orthodox [[Stern College for Women]] - in Manhattan, New York - combines Torah and University studies, as at Bar-Ilan;\nthe Haredi [[Touro_College_and_University_System#Undergraduate_schools|Lander College for Women]] similarly.\n<!-- \n==Coed high school Midrashot==\nWhile a [[Hebrew school]] program typically handles [[Jewish education]] for youths before their [[Bar/Bat Mitzvah]], students who wish to continue their Jewish education through high school enroll in a Midrasha.\n -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beis Yaakov]]\n* [[List of Midrashot]]\n* [[Role of women in Judaism]]\n* [[Female seminary]]\n* [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]]\n* [[Haredi Judaism #Education]]\n* [[Ulpana]]\n* [[Women in Judaism #Views on the education of women]]\n* [[Jewish education#Girls' education]]  \n* [[Orthodox Judaism #Diversity]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n\n<!-- Categories -->\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish schools for women]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrasha"}
