In part, this is because the pronunciation of Standard Chinese was based on Beijing pronunciation. (See [[Standard Chinese]] for its phonology charts; the same basic structure applies to the Beijing dialect.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, some striking differences exist. Most prominent is the proliferation of [[rhotic vowel]]s. All rhotic vowels are the result of the use of the -{{lang|zh|\u513f}} {{IPA|/-\u025a/}}, a [[noun]] [[Affix|suffix]], except for a few words pronounced {{IPA|[\u0250\u025a\u032f]}} that do not have this suffix. In Standard Chinese, these also occur but much less often than they appear in Beijing dialect. This phenomenon is known as {{transl|zh|ISO|[[\u00e9rhu\u00e0]]}} ({{lang|zh|\u513f\u5316}}) or [[R-colored vowel|rhotacization]], as is considered one of the iconic characteristics of Beijing Mandarin.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen /w/ occurs in syllable-initial position, many speakers use [\u028b] before vowels other than [o] as in {{lang|zh|\u6211}} {{transl|zh|ISO|''w\u01d2''}}, and [u] as in \u4e94 ''wu'', e.g. {{lang|zh|\u5c3e\u5df4}} {{transl|zh|ISO|''w\u011biba''}} {{IPA|[\u028bei\u032f\u02e8pa\u02e6]}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Divergent places of articulation: [w] and [\u028b] in modern spoken Mandarin|url=http://naccl.osu.edu/sites/naccl.osu.edu/files/NACCL-23_1_12.pdf|author1=Seth Wiener  |author2=Ya-ting Shih |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Beijing dialect has a few phonetic reductions that are usually considered too \"colloquial\" for use in Standard Chinese. For example, in fast speech, initial consonants go through [[lenition]] if they are in an [[lexical stress|unstressed]] [[syllable]]: [[pinyin]] {{angle bracket|{{transl|zh|ISO|zh ch sh}}}} {{IPA|/t\u0282 t\u0282\u02b0 \u0282/}} become {{angle bracket|r}} {{IPA|/\u027b/}}, so {{lang|zh|\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053}} {{transl|zh|ISO|''b\u00f9zh\u012bd\u00e0o''}} \"don't know\" can sound like {{transl|zh|ISO|''b\u00f9rd\u00e0o''}}; ''laoshi'' \u8001\u5e08 can sound like ''laoer''; resulting in a \"swallowing of consonants\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n{{angle bracket|j q x}} {{IPA|/t\u0255 t\u0255\u02b0 \u0255/}} become {{angle bracket|y}} {{IPA|/j/}}, so {{lang|zh|\u8d76\u7d27\u53bb}} {{transl|zh|ISO|''g\u01cenj\u01d0nq\u00f9''}} \"go quickly\" can sound like {{transl|zh|ISO|''g\u01ceny\u01d0nq\u00f9''}}; [[pinyin]] {{angle bracket|b d g}} {{IPA|/p t k/}} go through [[phonation|voicing]] to become {{IPA|[b d \u0261]}}; similar changes also occur on other consonants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nSome of these changes yield syllables that violate the syllable structure of Standard Chinese, such as \u5927\u67f5\u6b04 ''D\u00e0 Zh\u00e0l\u00e1n'' Street, which locals pronounce as ''D\u00e0shl\u00e0r''.<ref>[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2931#more-2931 ''Language Log'']</ref><ref name=\"VisitBeijing\">{{cite web |title=A Quick Guide to China's Main Dialects |url=http://english.visitbeijing.com.cn/a1/a-X9XUV48A34845502973AE3 |website=english.visitbeijing.com.cn |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hu |first1=King |title=A Question That Is Not a Question |url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/35961/1/QuestionNotQuestion.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of Beijing dialect tend to be more exaggerated than Standard Chinese.

In contrast, the Manchus of [[Aigun]], [[Heilongjiang]] could both pronounce Manchu sounds properly and mimic the sinified pronunciation of Manchus in Beijing. This was because they learned the Beijing pronunciation from either studying in Peking or from officials sent to Aigun from Beijing. They could also tell them apart, using the Chinese influenced pronunciation of Beijing to demonstrate that they were better educated and had \"superior stature\" in society.<ref name=\"Shiro\">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FpEyQ1tUYTkC&q= |title= Archives polonaises d'etudes orientales, Volumes 8-10 |first=S.

Shortly after, Harvey and Norman were given notice and redundancy package of six months pay.

The enterprise was intended to be a single store but its success led to the opening of others. Harvey Norman Holdings Limited was listed on the Australian stock market on 3 September 1987.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Harvey Norman adopted the superstore format then successful in the [[United States]], and entered the [[computer]] and [[furniture]] markets. \nThe first computer superstore was opened at [[Bennetts Green, New South Wales|Bennetts Green]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], in late 1993 with much fanfare. That was followed several weeks later by the opening of a larger superstore at [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] (Sydney, NSW). Many stores later expanded their computer sections.\n \nStrong support was provided to the chain by distributors such as [[Merisel]], [[Dataflow]], [[Tech Pacific]], and [[Marketing Results]]. Extra support and funding was supplied by vendors (supplied by these distributors) such as [[Microsoft]], [[Corel]], [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] and [[WordPerfect]].\n\nHarvey Norman also sold [[Apple Computer]] products for several years. The launch of [[Windows 95]] was a huge success, with a few Sydney stores opening at midnight, and some regional areas opening at 6 a.m. The products came with a bonus pack featuring [[Harvard Graphics]] on CD and an introductory internet offer from [[OzEmail]]. Apple decided to stop supplying the chain in the late 1990s, but returned in 2004 with the [[iPod]] range, which later expanded into [[iPad]]s, [[iPhone]]s and [[iMacs]].\n \nA Norman Ross store was opened at [[Bennetts Green, New South Wales|Bennetts Green]] in 1995, with the purpose of being a clearance centre. That had mixed results, and was closed within 12 months. However, the Bennetts Green store expanded into larger premises in 1996, where it operates today. Part of the relocation was a dedicated educational centre, named Kidscape. Specialist employees from Dataflow provided advice to parents on which software was best for their child. Kidscape was installed at a number of stores, but it was discontinued at a number of them within two years.\n\nSome stores also opened early for the [[Windows 98]] launch, which included a number of offers, including an SPC CD with [[Harvard Graphics]] and [[Quicken]]. Other products, such as modems and printers, were promoted at $98.\n\nHarvey Norman has relied on 'bricks & mortar' stores as its strength. When suppliers such as [[Compaq]] and [[IBM]] started supplying direct, Harvey Norman stopped selling those products in-store. After Compaq later stopped selling direct, Harvey Norman returned to selling Compaq PC products.\n\nHarvey Norman's growth occurred organically until it acquired Joyce Mayne in 1998. A number of electrical stores in Western Australia, some of which were owned by [[Wesfarmers]], were purchased. Further acquisitions followed and by 2000 the chain had 100 stores. In 2006, [[Retravision]] was struggling, and a number of Retravision stores were acquired by Harvey Norman. Many were later converted to either Harvey Norman or Joyce Mayne stores, but those that were not successful were closed down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harveynorman.com.au/site/01/html/corp/pdf_files/Company_Profile_Sept_2006.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Company Profile - History |accessdate=2007-06-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421143659/http://www.harveynorman.com.au/site/01/html/corp/pdf_files/Company_Profile_Sept_2006.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Harvey Norman Superstore.jpg|thumb|300px|A Harvey Norman superstore in [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales]]]]\n\n==Company structure==\nHarvey Norman's operating structure is unusual in that each store department (flooring, bedding, furniture, computer and electrical) is operated by a separate entity of management. Thus many [[superstore]]s are a combination of three or four separate businesses managed independently contributing revenue to Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. through lease payments and a portion of sales.<ref name=\"smartcompany.com.au\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/growth/18045-20110104-clive-peeters-an-eeeasy-model-for-success-to-harvey-norman/ |title=Clive Peeters an eeeasy model for success to Harvey Norman - SmartCompany |last=A |first=Moogy |website=SmartCompany |language=en-AU |access-date=2016-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803200725/http://www.smartcompany.com.au/growth/18045-20110104-clive-peeters-an-eeeasy-model-for-success-to-harvey-norman/ |archivedate=3 August 2016 }}</ref> Overseas, Harvey Norman stores are directly owned and operated by the ASX-listed, Sydney-based parent company, Harvey Norman Holdings Limited. However, sales commissions are still heavily used across all departments of the store to motivate salespeople, drive sales and improve service.\n\nRetail marketing consultant Kevin Moore argues that this 'high reward-based remuneration structure' drives Harvey Norman's point of difference and is what contributes, at least partly, to its retail dominance. \"Almost all the people in a Harvey Norman are there because they are great salespeople, can propose solutions for customers and are paid in line with what they sell... So when you walk into a Harvey Norman, the guys on the floor have a real reason to help you. You walk away happy at the end of the day having spent money with them. And so do the staff because some of the money you left in the store goes to them... for helping you solve a problem in your life.\" <ref name=\"smartcompany.com.au\"/>\n\n=== Harvey Norman ===\nHarvey Norman is the flagship brand of Harvey Norman Holdings Pty Ltd. Harvey Norman is mainly a [[household goods]] retailer \u2014 with items being sold in their stores including [[major appliance]]s, [[small appliance]]s, [[information technology]] (such as computers, printers and mobile phones), [[furniture]], bedding, hardware (bathrooms) and flooring among other things. There are 166 Harvey Norman franchised complexes in Australia, as at 12 June  2015, with separate franchisees owning and operating separate departments.

The enterprise was intended to be a single store but its success led to the opening of others. Harvey Norman Holdings Limited was listed on the Australian stock market on 3 September 1987.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Harvey Norman adopted the superstore format then successful in the [[United States]], and entered the [[computer]] and [[furniture]] markets. \nThe first computer superstore was opened at [[Bennetts Green, New South Wales|Bennetts Green]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], in late 1993 with much fanfare. That was followed several weeks later by the opening of a larger superstore at [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] (Sydney, NSW). Many stores later expanded their computer sections.\n \nStrong support was provided to the chain by distributors such as [[Merisel]], [[Dataflow]], [[Tech Pacific]], and [[Marketing Results]]. Extra support and funding was supplied by vendors (supplied by these distributors) such as [[Microsoft]], [[Corel]], [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] and [[WordPerfect]].\n\nHarvey Norman also sold [[Apple Computer]] products for several years. The launch of [[Windows 95]] was a huge success, with a few Sydney stores opening at midnight, and some regional areas opening at 6 a.m. The products came with a bonus pack featuring [[Harvard Graphics]] on CD and an introductory internet offer from [[OzEmail]]. Apple decided to stop supplying the chain in the late 1990s, but returned in 2004 with the [[iPod]] range, which later expanded into [[iPad]]s, [[iPhone]]s and [[iMacs]].\n \nA Norman Ross store was opened at [[Bennetts Green, New South Wales|Bennetts Green]] in 1995, with the purpose of being a clearance centre. That had mixed results, and was closed within 12 months. However, the Bennetts Green store expanded into larger premises in 1996, where it operates today. Part of the relocation was a dedicated educational centre, named Kidscape. Specialist employees from Dataflow provided advice to parents on which software was best for their child. Kidscape was installed at a number of stores, but it was discontinued at a number of them within two years.\n\nSome stores also opened early for the [[Windows 98]] launch, which included a number of offers, including an SPC CD with [[Harvard Graphics]] and [[Quicken]]. Other products, such as modems and printers, were promoted at $98.\n\nHarvey Norman has relied on 'bricks & mortar' stores as its strength. When suppliers such as [[Compaq]] and [[IBM]] started supplying direct, Harvey Norman stopped selling those products in-store. After Compaq later stopped selling direct, Harvey Norman returned to selling Compaq PC products.\n\nHarvey Norman's growth occurred organically until it acquired Joyce Mayne in 1998. A number of electrical stores in Western Australia, some of which were owned by [[Wesfarmers]], were purchased. Further acquisitions followed and by 2000 the chain had 100 stores. In 2006, [[Retravision]] was struggling, and a number of Retravision stores were acquired by Harvey Norman. Many were later converted to either Harvey Norman or Joyce Mayne stores, but those that were not successful were closed down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harveynorman.com.au/site/01/html/corp/pdf_files/Company_Profile_Sept_2006.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Company Profile - History |accessdate=2007-06-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421143659/http://www.harveynorman.com.au/site/01/html/corp/pdf_files/Company_Profile_Sept_2006.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Harvey Norman Superstore.jpg|thumb|300px|A Harvey Norman superstore in [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales]]]]\n\n==Company structure==\nHarvey Norman's operating structure is unusual in that each store department (flooring, bedding, furniture, computer and electrical) is operated by a separate entity of management.

However, sales commissions are still heavily used across all departments of the store to motivate salespeople, drive sales and improve service.\n\nRetail marketing consultant Kevin Moore argues that this 'high reward-based remuneration structure' drives Harvey Norman's point of difference and is what contributes, at least partly, to its retail dominance. \"Almost all the people in a Harvey Norman are there because they are great salespeople, can propose solutions for customers and are paid in line with what they sell... So when you walk into a Harvey Norman, the guys on the floor have a real reason to help you. You walk away happy at the end of the day having spent money with them. And so do the staff because some of the money you left in the store goes to them... for helping you solve a problem in your life.\" <ref name=\"smartcompany.com.au\"/>\n\n=== Harvey Norman ===\nHarvey Norman is the flagship brand of Harvey Norman Holdings Pty Ltd.

They looked to improve upon their 3\u201313 season the year before, and did so after defeating the [[2012 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] in Week 5; their win over the [[2012 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] in Week 16 made this their first winning season since [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|2009]]. The Vikings also made the playoffs for the first time since 2009 with a Week 17 win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] to give them a 10\u20136 regular season record, but were defeated by the same opponents in the Wild Card playoff round the following week. [[Adrian Peterson]] was named the league's [[Most Valuable Player]] after rushing for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of breaking the single-season record held by [[Eric Dickerson]] since [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nOn May 10, 2012, the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] approved a bill for a new stadium for the team that would see a new facility (later named [[U.S. Bank Stadium]]) constructed by 2016 and ensure the Vikings' presence in [[Minneapolis]] through the year 2046.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Minnesota Vikings stadium law heads to governor amid questions over state's financing |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-minnesota-vikings-stadium-law-heads-to-governor-amid-questions-over-states-financing/ |website=CBSNews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> The bill was signed by Governor [[Mark Dayton]] on May 14,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dayton Signs $975M Vikings Stadium Bill |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/14/dayton-to-sign-975m-vikings-stadium-bill/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> and approved by the [[Minneapolis City Council]] by a vote of 7\u20136 on May 25.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederick |last=Melo |title=Vikings stadium wins Minneapolis City Council's final approval |url=https://www.twincities.com/2012/05/24/vikings-stadium-wins-minneapolis-city-councils-final-approval/ |website=TwinCities.com |publisher=Digital First Media |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=City Council's Final Vote In Favor Of Stadium, 7-6 |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/25/mpls-city-council-makes-final-stadium-vote-friday/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\n[[File:Adrian Peterson broke Vikings franchise rushing record.jpg|thumb|Adrian Peterson rushed to a new career franchise record against Jacksonville in week 1, overtaking [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]]'s 6,818 rushing yards]]\n\n===Pre-draft transactions===\nThe first major transactions of the 2012 offseason were the releases of veteran guards [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]] and [[Anthony Herrera (American football)|Anthony Herrera]], and CB [[Cedric Griffin]] on March 10, as the Vikings began rebuilding their offensive line and secondary. Three days later, the team re-signed perennial backup QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] and DT [[Letroy Guion]] off their unrestricted free agents list. This was followed up with the signing of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' unrestricted free agent TE [[John Carlson (American football)|John Carlson]] on a five-year contract.\n\nThe next week, the team brought in FB [[Jerome Felton]], also an unrestricted free agent, from the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. They then released DT [[Remi Ayodele]] on March 21, but re-signed DT [[Fred Evans (defensive tackle)|Fred Evans]]. March 26 was a big day for signings by the Vikings, with the re-signings of WR [[Devin Aromashodu]] and LB [[Erin Henderson]], as well as the free agent acquisitions of CB [[Zack Bowman]] from the [[Chicago Bears]] and T [[Geoff Schwartz]] from the [[Carolina Panthers]].\n\nApril saw very few transactions go through in anticipation of the [[2012 NFL Draft]] at the end of the month. Nevertheless, the Vikings signed LB [[Marvin Mitchell]] and WR [[Jerome Simpson]], despite the fact that Simpson would miss the first three games of the season for a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\n===Draft===\n{{main|2012 NFL draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|[[Pro Bowl]]er\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331.

In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll. \n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide. Hurts finished in second in the conference in both passing yards and rushing yards, and led the conference with 53 total touchdowns. He finished in second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Wide receiver [[CeeDee Lamb]] was a [[2019 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]]. Hurts, Lamb, and center [[Creed Humphrey]] were named [[2019 All-Big 12 Conference football team|first-team all-conference]].

The team was led by [[Lincoln Riley]], in his third year as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331. Oklahoma finished conference play tied with Baylor for the best record in the conference with an 8\u20131 record, earning them each a spot in the [[2019 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. There, they defeated Baylor a second time, this time by a score of 30\u201323 in overtime, to win Oklahoma's fifth consecutive and 13th overall Big 12 title. In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll. \n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide. Hurts finished in second in the conference in both passing yards and rushing yards, and led the conference with 53 total touchdowns. He finished in second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Wide receiver [[CeeDee Lamb]] was a [[2019 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]]. Hurts, Lamb, and center [[Creed Humphrey]] were named [[2019 All-Big 12 Conference football team|first-team all-conference]]. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference linebacker [[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]].\n\n==Previous season==\nThe Sooners finished the season 12\u20131, 8\u20131 in Big 12 play. Finishing with the best record in conference play the Sooners clinched a berth in the [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|conference championship game]] where they defeated Texas 39\u201327 to win their 12th Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma was selected as the fourth seed to play in the 2018 College Football playoff against first seed [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the [[2018 Orange Bowl]], which ended up being a 34\u201345 loss.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Award watch lists=== \n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Oklahoma Sooners|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2019-watch-list/|title=2019 LOTT IMPACT TROPHY WATCH LIST CANDIDATES \u2013 Lott IMPACT Trophy|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]]\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-maxwell-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Maxwell Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Jalen Hurts]]\n|QB\n|GS\n|- \n|[[CeeDee Lamb]]\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-bednarik-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Bednarik Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR \n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Fred Biletnikoff Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/2019-biletnikoff-award-watch-list|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|- \n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[John Mackey Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 John Mackey Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://www.johnmackeyaward.com/uploads/3/4/7/9/34791900/2019_john_mackey_award_preseason_watch_list_-_final_7-18-19.pdf|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=109|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|[[Creed Humphrey]]\n|C\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Butkus Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Butkus Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://thebutkusaward.com/watchlist/view.aspx?t=c|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|- \n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Outland Trophy Award Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/outland190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Creed Humphrey\n|OL\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Neville Gallimore (American football)|Neville Gallimore]]\n|DL\n|RS SR\n|-\n|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/nagurski190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award|Dodd Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodd Trophy Announces 2019 Preseason Watch List|url=http://www.thedoddtrophy.com/the-dodd-trophy-announces-2019-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Lincoln Riley]]\n| HC\n| \u2013\n|-\n|[[Wuerffel Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wuerffel Trophy Unveils 2019 Watch List|url=https://www.wuerffeltrophy.org/post/wuerffel-trophy-unveils-watch-list-for-2019|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Foundation Announces 2019 Player of the Year Preseason Watch List|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-foundation-announces-2019-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts \n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award]]\n|Kennedy Brooks\n|RB\n|RS SO\n|-\n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|Tanner Mordecai \n|QB\n|RS FR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Arm Award Announces 2019 Class of Candidates|url=http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/golden-arm-award-announces-2019-class-candidates/|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|}\n\n===Big 12 media days===\nThe 2019 Big 12 media days were held July 15\u201316, 2019 in [[Frisco, Texas]].

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}<br>(4) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

He was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], and later a [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] MP in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn at 10 Hamill Street, in the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Lower Falls]] area of [[Belfast]], he was the fifth child of Charles Devlin (died 1906) who ran a [[hackney cab]], and his wife Eliza King (died 1902) who sold groceries from their home, were both [[Roman Catholics]].<ref>Hepburn, Anthony C.: in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Vol. 15, Oxford University Press, (2004), p.983</ref> Until he was twelve he attended the nearby [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' School]] in Divis Street, where he was educated in a more [[Irish nationalism|'national' view]] of [[Irish history]] and [[Culture of Ireland|culture]] than offered by the diocesan schools or the state system.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983</ref>\n\nWhile working briefly as a clerk and in a pub, he showed an early gift for public speaking <ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983</ref> when he became chairman of a debating society founded in 1886 to commemorate the first Irish nationalist election victory in West Belfast. From 1891\u20131893 he was a journalist on the ''[[Irish News]]'', then on the ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' when he became associated with the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] (AOH), which he helped to establish in the 1890s.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.983</ref> He became a lifelong opponent of its [[loyalist]] counterpart, the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. He then worked at [[Samuel Young (Irish politician)|Samuel Young]] MP's brewery company, for whom he managed a Belfast pub until 1902.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.983</ref>\n\n==Skilled politician==\nDuring the 1890s he was active as organiser in the anti-Parnellite [[Irish National Federation]] in eastern [[Ulster]]. When [[William O'Brien]] founded the [[United Irish League]] (UIL) in [[County Mayo]] in 1898, Devlin founded the UIL section in Belfast which became his political machine in Ulster. He was elected unopposed<ref name='Year Book'>[https://archive.org/details/constitutionaly07unkngoog The Constitutional Year Book], 1904, published by [[Conservative Central Office]], page 190 (214 in web page)</ref> as [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) Member of Parliament for [[North Kilkenny (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilkenny North]] in the February [[1902 North Kilkenny by-election|1902 by-election]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27411 |date=28 February 1902 |page=1281 }}</ref> His first political assignment came that year when the Party sent him to [[Irish American|Irish Americas]] on the first of several successful fund-raising missions.\n\nIt was there that he encountered the power of the Hibernian Orders and on his return set about claiming it for constitutional nationalism, when in 1904 he became lifelong [[Grand master (order)|Grandmaster]] of the AOH in Ireland. Members of his Order, largely composed of earlier members of the [[Molly Maguires]], a militant secret society also known as ''the Mollies'', also became members of the Irish Party, deeply infiltrating it.<ref>[[Tom Garvin|Garvin, Tom]]: ''The Evolution of Irish Nationalist Politics'' (2005) pp. 107\u2013110: ''The Rise of the Hibernians'' {{ISBN|0-7171-3967-0}}</ref> Already secretary of the London-based United Irish League of Great Britain Devlin became General Secretary of O\u2019Brien's UIL, replacing [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]], through the initiative of deputy IPP leader [[John Dillon]] MP, with whom he held a close alliance and who had fallen under his influence. This \"coup\" gave them nationwide control of the 1200 UIL branches, the organisational base of the IPP, depriving O'Brien of all authority.\n\nDevlin had risen in the ranks of the League from being a local Nationalist organiser in Belfast to becoming the only newcomer to the parliamentary party who was accepted politically, as an equal by the established leaders. He was devoted to Dillon who had helped him greatly to his rise to prominence, and Dillon in turn relied greatly on him, not alone for both his control of the UIL and the AOH, but also because he was an outstanding representative of Ulster Nationalism.<ref>[[F. S. L. Lyons|Lyons, F. S. L.]]: ''John Dillon'', Ch. 10, p. 288, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London (1968), SBN 7100 2887 3</ref>\n\n==Immense influence==\nHe became a distinguished parliamentarian and had reached the top by the skilful use of two remarkable talents, his persuasive and very powerful oratory, and secondly, that he was a great organisation man, not merely as General Secretary of the United Irish League, but because he also dominated the Ancient Order of Hibernians.<ref>Lyons, F. S. L.: p.324</ref> He was the only member of the younger generation to belong to the innermost circle of the IPP leadership and was widely seen as eventual heir-apparent.<ref>Maume, Patrick: ''The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891\u20131918'', p.45, Gill & Macmillan (1999) {{ISBN|0-7171-2744-3}}</ref>\n\nFor some years Devlin had been in bitter conflict with the bishops' Catholic Association who wanted politics based on Catholic rights rather than on nationalism. Now in control of the three nationalist political organisations all sides succumbed to Devlin's influence. The AOH continued the [[Daniel O\u2019Connell|O'Connellite]] link between Catholicism and nationalism but under a lay controlled organisations. To the Irish party's opponents the AOH was synonymous with Catholic sectarianism, jobbery and patronage.<ref>Miller, David W.: ''Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898\u20131921'' pp.208\u201315, Gill & Macmillan (1973) {{ISBN|0-7171-0645-4}}</ref><ref>Hepburn, A.:, Oxford Dictionary p.983</ref> Devlin represented the main urban and national business interests, which contrasted with his advocacy of social reforms when he took up labour issues especially working conditions in the [[Living Linen|linen mills]] and textile trades.\n\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 British general election]], Devlin was re-elected to Kilkenny North, and also to [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] which he regained from the Unionists by 16 votes. Choosing to retain the Belfast seat, he served as its MP beyond 1918, when his popularity in Belfast and east Ulster survived the downfall of the IPP. Devlin became governor of the nationalist hinterland after his AOH political machinery rapidly saturated the country, acting through the UIL as the militant support organisation of the Irish Party. Devlin could assure [[John Redmond]] leader of the IPP, that at Redmond's bid, his organisation could provide full attendance of suitable \"supporters\" at any meeting, demonstration or convention throughout Ireland,<ref>Garvin, T.: p.108</ref> something Redmond and his party often availed of.\n\nThe AOH was vehemently opposed by one nationalist organisation, the [[Munster]] based [[All-for-Ireland League]] (AFIL), an independent party founded by William O'Brien who held Devlin's AOH as being at the root of widespread religious intimidation and sectarianism. He and his followers were attacked at a UIL Convention in Dublin in February 1909 by 400 militant \"Mollies\" organised by Devlin to silence him and his followers at what became known as the \"[[All-for-Ireland League#Baton Convention|Baton Convention]]\".<ref>O'Brien, Joseph V.: ''William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881\u20131918'',  ''The All-for-Ireland League'' p. 187, University of California Press (1976) {{ISBN|0-520-02886-4}}</ref>\n\n==Home Rule compromised==\nWith the [[Ireland and World War I|involvement of Ireland]] on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Devlin sided with Redmond's decision in supporting recruiting<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref> for  Britain's and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied war effort]] and voluntary enlistment of [[National Volunteers]] in [[Irish regiment#|Irish regiments]] of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Service Army]]. Redmond's plan was that, post-war, an intended 'Irish Brigade' and the National Volunteers would provide the basis for an Irish army, capable of enforcing Home Rule on reluctant Ulster Unionists.<ref>Bowman, Timothy: ''Irish Regiments in the Great War''  \"Raising the Service battalions\" p.62  (Note 2: Dooley, T. P. ''[[The Irish Sword]]'' XVIII, 72, (1991) p. 209) Manchester University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7190-6285-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] Devlin compromised with Northern Nationalists on a temporary six-county exclusion to assist [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]'s abortive home rule negotiations, organising a convention which endorsed exclusion by a vote of 475 to 265.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary p.984</ref> On the other hand, during the [[Irish Convention]] he sided with the bishops in blocking Redmond's compromise with [[Irish Unionist Party|Southern Unionists]] on Home Rule.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref> In April 1918 Devlin was signatory to the anti- [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]] pledge. At the end of the war he was elected Nationalist MP for [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Falls]] in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] (in which he defeated [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] of [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]]), one of the very few Irish Parliamentary Party MPs to retain their seats against the Sinn F\u00e9in landslide.\n\n==Minority leader==\nDuring 1919\u20131921 his leadership was reduced to six Nationalist MPs. His attempts to achieve a united nationalist front was undermined because of resentment by west Ulster nationalists of his acceptance of temporary partition as the price for a Home Rule settlement in 1916.<ref>Maume, Patrick: ''Who's Who'' p.225</ref> He avoided any involvement in All-Ireland politics having accepted that the mandate had passed to [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. Although, when he tried to bring up the [[Croke Park]] killings that occurred on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] at Westminster, he was shouted down and physically attacked by Conservative MP [[John Elsdale Molson]]; the Speaker had to [[List of incidents of grave disorder in the British House of Commons|suspend the sitting]].\n\nIn the first election in 1921 for the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]] after the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] was enacted, so as not to allow the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]]s a \"walk-over\" he agreed a pact with de Valera that Nationalists would not stand against Sinn F\u00e9iners; both parties co-operated during the election and won 6 seats each, the Unionists 40. Devlin, who represented a more moderate nationalist view, was elected for both [[Antrim (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] and [[Belfast West (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]]. He chose to sit for Belfast West although his seat in the seven member Antrim constituency was left vacant for the rest of the Parliament. He continued to sit at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] as leader of the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] of Northern Ireland, as both small parties did not recognise the [[Stormont Castle|Stormont]] parliament. His Belfast Falls seat was abolished in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], when Devlin unsuccessfully fought [[Liverpool Exchange (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Exchange]]; he returned to Westminster in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].\n\nDevlin was re-elected in Belfast West in 1925 when he decided to lead his small party out of abstentionism and sat for the first time in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] as head of a powerless opposition, but so as to highlight Catholic grievances, especially in relation to education. He was returned for the four member constituency until [[Proportional Representation]] by the [[Single Transferable Vote]] was abolished for territorial constituencies and single member seats were introduced for the 1929 election.\n\nFrom 1929 until his death, Joe Devlin was the Northern Ireland MP for [[Fermanagh and Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and Tyrone]]. He won amendment to the Northern Ireland Education Act of 1930 which improved the funding of Catholic schools. Otherwise they were years of demoralisation for northern Catholics, and the party abstained after 1932 due to the abolishment of proportional representation, when frustration finally drove him and his followers out of the Belfast parliament again, when his party abstained.\n<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary p.984</ref>\n\n==Personal background==\n\"Wee Joe\" as he was popularly known,<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref> was held in high affection by his constituents for his charming and effervescent personality. He was a fluent and powerful orator. In later years he was comfortably off as director of the ''Distillery Company'' and chairman of the ''Irish News'' and enjoyed organising summer f\u00eates \u2013 \"days of delight\" \u2013 for Belfast children. His approach in life was 'getting things done'. He lived most of his life in Belfast, though he spent some earlier years in London. He never married.  An acknowledged spokesman and leader of Catholic nationalists in Ulster for decades, Devlin died in Belfast on 18 January 1934.  He was buried at [[Milltown Cemetery]]. His funeral at [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St. Peter's]], Belfast, was attended by leading members of both governments. The AOH hall in [[Ardboe]], [[County Tyrone]], is named after him.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* ''Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801\u20131922'', edited by B.M.

He was elected unopposed<ref name='Year Book'>[https://archive.org/details/constitutionaly07unkngoog The Constitutional Year Book], 1904, published by [[Conservative Central Office]], page 190 (214 in web page)</ref> as [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) Member of Parliament for [[North Kilkenny (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilkenny North]] in the February [[1902 North Kilkenny by-election|1902 by-election]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27411 |date=28 February 1902 |page=1281 }}</ref> His first political assignment came that year when the Party sent him to [[Irish American|Irish Americas]] on the first of several successful fund-raising missions.\n\nIt was there that he encountered the power of the Hibernian Orders and on his return set about claiming it for constitutional nationalism, when in 1904 he became lifelong [[Grand master (order)|Grandmaster]] of the AOH in Ireland. Members of his Order, largely composed of earlier members of the [[Molly Maguires]], a militant secret society also known as ''the Mollies'', also became members of the Irish Party, deeply infiltrating it.<ref>[[Tom Garvin|Garvin, Tom]]: ''The Evolution of Irish Nationalist Politics'' (2005) pp. 107\u2013110: ''The Rise of the Hibernians'' {{ISBN|0-7171-3967-0}}</ref> Already secretary of the London-based United Irish League of Great Britain Devlin became General Secretary of O\u2019Brien's UIL, replacing [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]], through the initiative of deputy IPP leader [[John Dillon]] MP, with whom he held a close alliance and who had fallen under his influence. This \"coup\" gave them nationwide control of the 1200 UIL branches, the organisational base of the IPP, depriving O'Brien of all authority.\n\nDevlin had risen in the ranks of the League from being a local Nationalist organiser in Belfast to becoming the only newcomer to the parliamentary party who was accepted politically, as an equal by the established leaders. He was devoted to Dillon who had helped him greatly to his rise to prominence, and Dillon in turn relied greatly on him, not alone for both his control of the UIL and the AOH, but also because he was an outstanding representative of Ulster Nationalism.<ref>[[F.

L.]]: ''John Dillon'', Ch. 10, p. 288, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London (1968), SBN 7100 2887 3</ref>\n\n==Immense influence==\nHe became a distinguished parliamentarian and had reached the top by the skilful use of two remarkable talents, his persuasive and very powerful oratory, and secondly, that he was a great organisation man, not merely as General Secretary of the United Irish League, but because he also dominated the Ancient Order of Hibernians.<ref>Lyons, F. S. L.: p.324</ref> He was the only member of the younger generation to belong to the innermost circle of the IPP leadership and was widely seen as eventual heir-apparent.<ref>Maume, Patrick: ''The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891\u20131918'', p.45, Gill & Macmillan (1999) {{ISBN|0-7171-2744-3}}</ref>\n\nFor some years Devlin had been in bitter conflict with the bishops' Catholic Association who wanted politics based on Catholic rights rather than on nationalism. Now in control of the three nationalist political organisations all sides succumbed to Devlin's influence. The AOH continued the [[Daniel O\u2019Connell|O'Connellite]] link between Catholicism and nationalism but under a lay controlled organisations. To the Irish party's opponents the AOH was synonymous with Catholic sectarianism, jobbery and patronage.<ref>Miller, David W.: ''Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898\u20131921'' pp.208\u201315, Gill & Macmillan (1973) {{ISBN|0-7171-0645-4}}</ref><ref>Hepburn, A.:, Oxford Dictionary p.983</ref> Devlin represented the main urban and national business interests, which contrasted with his advocacy of social reforms when he took up labour issues especially working conditions in the [[Living Linen|linen mills]] and textile trades.\n\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 British general election]], Devlin was re-elected to Kilkenny North, and also to [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] which he regained from the Unionists by 16 votes. Choosing to retain the Belfast seat, he served as its MP beyond 1918, when his popularity in Belfast and east Ulster survived the downfall of the IPP. Devlin became governor of the nationalist hinterland after his AOH political machinery rapidly saturated the country, acting through the UIL as the militant support organisation of the Irish Party. Devlin could assure [[John Redmond]] leader of the IPP, that at Redmond's bid, his organisation could provide full attendance of suitable \"supporters\" at any meeting, demonstration or convention throughout Ireland,<ref>Garvin, T.: p.108</ref> something Redmond and his party often availed of.\n\nThe AOH was vehemently opposed by one nationalist organisation, the [[Munster]] based [[All-for-Ireland League]] (AFIL), an independent party founded by William O'Brien who held Devlin's AOH as being at the root of widespread religious intimidation and sectarianism. He and his followers were attacked at a UIL Convention in Dublin in February 1909 by 400 militant \"Mollies\" organised by Devlin to silence him and his followers at what became known as the \"[[All-for-Ireland League#Baton Convention|Baton Convention]]\".<ref>O'Brien, Joseph V.: ''William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881\u20131918'',  ''The All-for-Ireland League'' p. 187, University of California Press (1976) {{ISBN|0-520-02886-4}}</ref>\n\n==Home Rule compromised==\nWith the [[Ireland and World War I|involvement of Ireland]] on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Devlin sided with Redmond's decision in supporting recruiting<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref> for  Britain's and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied war effort]] and voluntary enlistment of [[National Volunteers]] in [[Irish regiment#|Irish regiments]] of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Service Army]].

At the end of the war he was elected Nationalist MP for [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Falls]] in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] (in which he defeated [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] of [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]]), one of the very few Irish Parliamentary Party MPs to retain their seats against the Sinn F\u00e9in landslide.\n\n==Minority leader==\nDuring 1919\u20131921 his leadership was reduced to six Nationalist MPs. His attempts to achieve a united nationalist front was undermined because of resentment by west Ulster nationalists of his acceptance of temporary partition as the price for a Home Rule settlement in 1916.<ref>Maume, Patrick: ''Who's Who'' p.225</ref> He avoided any involvement in All-Ireland politics having accepted that the mandate had passed to [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. Although, when he tried to bring up the [[Croke Park]] killings that occurred on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] at Westminster, he was shouted down and physically attacked by Conservative MP [[John Elsdale Molson]]; the Speaker had to [[List of incidents of grave disorder in the British House of Commons|suspend the sitting]].\n\nIn the first election in 1921 for the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]] after the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] was enacted, so as not to allow the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]]s a \"walk-over\" he agreed a pact with de Valera that Nationalists would not stand against Sinn F\u00e9iners; both parties co-operated during the election and won 6 seats each, the Unionists 40. Devlin, who represented a more moderate nationalist view, was elected for both [[Antrim (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] and [[Belfast West (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]]. He chose to sit for Belfast West although his seat in the seven member Antrim constituency was left vacant for the rest of the Parliament. He continued to sit at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] as leader of the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] of Northern Ireland, as both small parties did not recognise the [[Stormont Castle|Stormont]] parliament. His Belfast Falls seat was abolished in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], when Devlin unsuccessfully fought [[Liverpool Exchange (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Exchange]]; he returned to Westminster in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].\n\nDevlin was re-elected in Belfast West in 1925 when he decided to lead his small party out of abstentionism and sat for the first time in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] as head of a powerless opposition, but so as to highlight Catholic grievances, especially in relation to education. He was returned for the four member constituency until [[Proportional Representation]] by the [[Single Transferable Vote]] was abolished for territorial constituencies and single member seats were introduced for the 1929 election.\n\nFrom 1929 until his death, Joe Devlin was the Northern Ireland MP for [[Fermanagh and Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and Tyrone]]. He won amendment to the Northern Ireland Education Act of 1930 which improved the funding of Catholic schools. Otherwise they were years of demoralisation for northern Catholics, and the party abstained after 1932 due to the abolishment of proportional representation, when frustration finally drove him and his followers out of the Belfast parliament again, when his party abstained.\n<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary p.984</ref>\n\n==Personal background==\n\"Wee Joe\" as he was popularly known,<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref> was held in high affection by his constituents for his charming and effervescent personality. He was a fluent and powerful orator. In later years he was comfortably off as director of the ''Distillery Company'' and chairman of the ''Irish News'' and enjoyed organising summer f\u00eates \u2013 \"days of delight\" \u2013 for Belfast children. His approach in life was 'getting things done'. He lived most of his life in Belfast, though he spent some earlier years in London. He never married.  An acknowledged spokesman and leader of Catholic nationalists in Ulster for decades, Devlin died in Belfast on 18 January 1934.  He was buried at [[Milltown Cemetery]]. His funeral at [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St. Peter's]], Belfast, was attended by leading members of both governments. The AOH hall in [[Ardboe]], [[County Tyrone]], is named after him.<ref>Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary:  p.984</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* ''Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801\u20131922'', edited by B.M.
