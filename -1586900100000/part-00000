If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statistical test is to verify whether this hypothesis is not false, but not, at the same time, to investigate other hypotheses, then such a test is called a ''significance test''. A statistical hypothesis that refers only to the numerical values of unknown parameters of a distribution is called a ''parametric hypothesis''. Methods of verifying statistical hypotheses are called ''statistical tests''. Tests of parametric hypotheses are called ''parametric tests''.<ref name=\"Fisz\">{{cite book |last= Fisz |first= Marek |title = Probability theory and mathematical statistics |edition = 3 |chapter = Significance Testing |page = 425 |publisher= John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |year = 1963 | location = New York }}</ref> We can likewise also have ''non-parametric hypotheses'' and ''non-parametric tests''. \n\nThe ''p''-value is used in the context of [[null hypothesis]] testing in order to quantify the idea of [[statistical significance]] of evidence.{{NoteTag|Note that the statistical significance of a result does not imply that the result is scientifically significant as well.{{what|Please clarify what \"scientifically significant\" means for a layman.|date=March 2020}}}} Null hypothesis testing is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument adapted to statistics. In essence, a claim is assumed valid if its counter-claim is improbable.\n\nAs such, the only hypothesis that needs to be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim is referred to as the [[null hypothesis]] (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified). A result is said to be ''statistically significant'' if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. The rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis. However, unless there is a single alternative to the null hypothesis, the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.\n\nAs a general example, if a null hypothesis states that a certain summary statistic follows the standard [[normal distribution]] N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the [[variance]] is not unity,{{what|Please clarify what \"unity\" means for a layman.|date=March 2020}} or (iii) the distribution is not normal, depending on the type of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.\n\nIf <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]] representing the observed data and <math>H</math> is the statistical hypothesis under consideration, then the notion of statistical significance can be naively quantified by the [[conditional probability]] <math>\\Pr(X|H)</math>, which gives the likelihood of a certain observation event ''X'' if the hypothesis is ''assumed'' to be correct. However, if <math>X</math> is a continuous random variable, the probability of observing a specific instance <math>x</math> is zero, that is, <math>\\Pr(X=x|H)=0.</math> Thus, this naive definition is inadequate and needs to be changed so as to accommodate the continuous random variables.\n\nNonetheless, it helps to clarify that ''p''-values should '''not''' be confused with probability on hypothesis (as is done in [[Bayes factor|Bayesian hypothesis testing]]) such as <math>\\Pr(H|X),</math> the probability of the hypothesis given the data, or <math>\\Pr(H),</math> the probability of the hypothesis being true, given <math>\\Pr(X),</math> the probability of observing the given data.\n\n== Definition and interpretation ==\n=== General ===\n[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|thumb|right|400 px|Example of a ''p''-value computation. The vertical coordinate is the [[probability density function|probability density]] of each outcome, computed under the null hypothesis. The ''p''-value is the area under the curve past the observed data point.]]\n\nThe ''p''-value is defined as the probability, under the [[null hypothesis]] <math>H</math> (at times denoted <math>H_0</math> as opposed to <math>H_\\mathrm{a}</math> denoting the alternative hypothesis) about the unknown distribution <math>F</math> of the random variable <math>X</math>, for the variate to be observed as a value equal to or more extreme than the value observed. If <math>x</math> is the observed value, then depending on how we interpret it, the \"equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed\" can mean <math>\\{ X \\geq x \\}</math> (right-tail event), <math>\\{ X \\leq x \\}</math> (left-tail event) or the event giving the smallest probability among <math>\\{ X \\leq x\\}</math> and <math>\\{ X \\geq x \\}</math> (double-tailed event). Thus, the ''p''-value is given by\n* <math>\\Pr(X \\geq x |H)</math> for right tail event,\n* <math>\\Pr(X \\leq x |H)</math> for left tail event,\n* <math>2\\min\\{\\Pr(X \\leq x |H),\\Pr(X \\geq x |H)\\}</math> for double tail event.\n\nThe smaller the ''p''-value, the higher the significance because it tells the investigator that the hypothesis under consideration may not adequately explain the observation. The null hypothesis <math>H</math> is rejected if any of these probabilities is less than or equal to a small, fixed but arbitrarily pre-defined threshold value <math>\\alpha</math>, which is referred to as the [[statistical significance|level of significance]]. Unlike the ''p''-value, the <math>\\alpha</math> level is not derived from any observational data and does not depend on the underlying hypothesis; the value of <math>\\alpha</math> is instead set by the researcher before examining the data. The setting of <math>\\alpha</math> is arbitrary. By convention, <math>\\alpha</math> is commonly set to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001.\n\nBecause the value of <math>x</math> that defines the left tail or right tail event is a random variable, this makes the ''p''-value a function of <math>x</math> and a [[random variable]] in itself; under the null hypothesis, the ''p''-value is defined uniformly over <math>[0,1]</math> interval, assuming <math>x</math> is continuous. Thus, the ''p''-value is not fixed. This implies that ''p''-value cannot be given a frequency counting interpretation since the probability has to be fixed for the frequency counting interpretation to hold. In other words, if the same test is repeated independently bearing upon the same overall null hypothesis, it will yield different ''p''-values at every repetition. Nevertheless, these different ''p''-values can be combined, for instance using [[Fisher's combined probability test]]. It should further be noted that an ''instantiation'' of this random ''p''-value can still be given a frequency counting interpretation with respect to the number of observations taken during a given test, as per the definition, as the percentage of observations more extreme than the one observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n=== Distribution ===\nWhen the null hypothesis is true, if it takes the form <math> H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0</math>, and the underlying random variable is continuous, then the [[probability distribution]] of the ''p''-value is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] on the interval [0,1].

In contrast, in a ''composite hypothesis'' the parameter's value is given by a set of numbers. While the above definition is satisfactory for a simple hypothesis, we need to be more cautious when dealing with compound hypotheses. For example, when testing the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal with a mean less than or equal to zero against the alternative that the mean is greater than zero (variance known), the null hypothesis does not specify the probability distribution of the appropriate test statistic. In the just mentioned example that would be the ''Z''-statistic belonging to the one-sided one-sample ''Z''-test. For each possible value of the theoretical mean, the ''Z''-test statistic has a different probability distribution. In these circumstances (the case of a so-called composite null hypothesis) the ''p''-value is defined by taking the least favourable null-hypothesis case, which is typically on the border between null and alternative.\n\n=== Misconceptions ===\n{{Main|Misuse of p-values}}\nAccording to the ASA, there is widespread agreement that ''p''-values are often [[Misunderstandings of p-values|misused and misinterpreted]].<ref name=\"ASA\" /> One practice that has been particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any ''p''-value nominally less than .05 without other supporting evidence. Although ''p''-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as \"the design of a study, the quality of the measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis\".<ref name=\"ASA\" /> Another concern is that the ''p''-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true.<ref name=\"ASA\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Colquhoun |first1=David |title = An investigation of the

In this method, as part of [[experimental design]], before performing the experiment, one first chooses a model (the [[null hypothesis]]) and a threshold value for ''p'', called the [[significance level]] of the test, traditionally 5% or 1%<ref name=\"nature506\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/506150a| pmid = 24522584| title = Scientific method: Statistical errors| journal = Nature| volume = 506| issue = 7487| pages = 150\u2013152| year = 2014| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R. | bibcode = 2014Natur.506..150N}}</ref> and denoted as ''\u03b1''. If the ''p''-value is less than the chosen significance level (''\u03b1''), that suggests that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the [[null hypothesis]] and that the null hypothesis may be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is true. When the ''p''-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the [[type I error rate]] is at most ''\u03b1''{{Explain|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. For typical analysis, using the standard ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when ''p'' < .05 and not rejected when ''p'' > .05. The ''p''-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n== Calculation ==\nUsually, <math>X</math> is a [[test statistic]], rather than any of the actual observations. A test statistic is the output of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function of all the observations. This statistic provides a single number, such as the average or the [[correlation coefficient]], that summarizes the characteristics of the data, in a way relevant to a particular inquiry. As such, the test statistic follows a distribution determined by the function used to define that test statistic and the distribution of the input observational data.\n\nFor the important case in which the data are hypothesized to follow the normal distribution, depending on the nature of the test statistic and thus the underlying hypothesis of the test statistic, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are [[z-test]] for [[normal distribution]], [[t-test]] for [[Student's t-distribution]], [[f-test]] for [[f-distribution]]. When the data do not follow a normal distribution, it can still be possible to approximate the distribution of these test statistics by a normal distribution by invoking the [[central limit theorem]] for large samples, as in the case of [[Pearson's chi-squared test]].\n\nThus computing a ''p''-value requires a null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a [[one-tailed test]] or a [[two-tailed test]]), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), but, in the early and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated ''p''-values from these discrete values{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Rather than using a table of ''p''-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed ''p''-values; this corresponds to computing the [[quantile function]] (inverse CDF).\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Coin flipping===\n{{Main|Checking whether a coin is fair}}\n\nAs an example of a statistical test, an experiment is performed to determine whether a [[coin flipping|coin flip]] is [[fair coin|fair]] (equal chance of landing heads or tails) or unfairly biased (one outcome being more likely than the other).\n\nSuppose that the experimental results show the coin turning up heads 14 times out of 20 total flips. The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and the test statistic is the number of heads. If a right-tailed test is considered, the ''p''-value of this result is the chance of a fair coin landing on heads ''at least'' 14 times out of 20 flips. That probability can be computed from [[binomial coefficient]]s as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\operatorname{Prob}(14\\text{ heads}) + \\operatorname{Prob}(15\\text{ heads}) +  \\cdots + \\operatorname{Prob}(20\\text{ heads}) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2^{20}} \\left[ \\binom{20}{14} + \\binom{20}{15} + \\cdots + \\binom{20}{20} \\right] = \\frac{60,\\!460}{1,\\!048,\\!576} \\approx 0.058\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis probability is the ''p''-value, considering only extreme results that favor heads. This is called a [[One- and two-tailed tests|one-tailed test]]. However, the deviation can be in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed ''p''-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the [[binomial distribution]] is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided ''p''-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided ''p''-value: the two-sided ''p''-value is 0.115.\n\nIn the above example:\n* Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): The coin is fair, with Prob(heads) = 0.5\n* Test statistic: Number of heads\n* Alpha level (designated threshold of significance): 0.05\n* Observation O: 14 heads out of 20 flips; and\n* Two-tailed ''p''-value of observation O given H<sub>0</sub> = 2*min(Prob(no. of heads \u2265&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads), Prob(no. of heads \u2264&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads))= 2*min(0.058, 0.978) = 2*0.058 = 0.115.<!-- Note we've summed the exact values not the rounded values.  Correct value = 0.1153183... -->\n\nNote that the Prob (no. of heads \u2264&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads) = 1 - Prob(no. of heads \u2265&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads) + Prob (no. of head = 14) = 1 - 0.058 + 0.036 = 0.978; however, symmetry of the binomial distribution makes it an unnecessary computation to find the smaller of the two probabilities. Here, the calculated ''p''-value exceeds .05, meaning that the data falls within the range of what would happen 95% of the time were the coin in fact fair. Hence, the null hypothesis is not rejected at the .05 level.\n\nHowever, had one more head been obtained, the resulting ''p''-value (two-tailed) would have been&nbsp;0.0414&nbsp;(4.14%), in which case the null hypothesis would be rejected at the .05 level.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Arbuthnot John Kneller.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Chest high painted portrait of man wearing a brown robe and head covering|John Arbuthnot]]\n[[File:Pierre-Simon-Laplace (1749-1827).jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Simon Laplace]]\n[[File:Karl_Pearson,_1910.jpg|thumb|alt=Man seated at his desk looking up at the camera|Karl Pearson]]\n[[File:Youngronaldfisher2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Sepia toned photo of young man wearing a suit, a medal, and wire-rimmed eyeglasses|[[Ronald Fisher]] ]]\n\nComputations of ''p''-values date back to the 1700s, where they were computed for the [[human sex ratio]] at birth, and used to compute statistical significance compared to the null hypothesis of equal probability of male and female births.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Descent of Human Sex Ratio at Birth |first1=\u00c9ric |last1=Brian |first2=Marie |last2=Jaisson |chapter=Physico-Theology and Mathematics (1710\u20131794) |pages=1\u201325 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6036-6}}</ref> [[John Arbuthnot]] studied this question in 1710,<ref>{{cite journal|author=John Arbuthnot |title=An argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the births of both sexes|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] | volume=27| pages=186\u2013190 | year=1710 | url = http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/arbuthnot.pdf|doi=10.1098/rstl.1710.0011|issue=325\u2013336}}</ref><ref name=\"Conover1999\">{{Citation\n|last=Conover\n|first=W.J.\n|title=Practical Nonparametric Statistics\n|edition=Third\n|year=1999\n|publisher=Wiley\n|isbn=978-0-471-16068-7\n|pages=157\u2013176\n|chapter=Chapter 3.4: The Sign Test\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Sprent1989\">{{Citation\n|last=Sprent\n|first=P.\n|title=Applied Nonparametric Statistical Methods\n|edition=Second\n|year=1989\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|isbn=978-0-412-44980-2\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = The History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty Before 1900 |first=Stephen M. |last=Stigler |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-67440341-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstatist00stig/page/225 225\u2013226]}}</ref> and examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710.

The statistics showed an excess of boys compared to girls. He concluded by calculation of a ''p''-value that the excess was a real, but unexplained, effect.}}\n\nThe ''p''-value was first formally introduced by [[Karl Pearson]], in his [[Pearson's chi-squared test]],{{sfn|Pearson|1900}} using the [[chi-squared distribution]] and notated as capital P.{{sfn|Pearson|1900}} The ''p''-values for the [[chi-squared distribution]] (for various values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> and degrees of freedom), now notated as ''P,'' was calculated in {{Harv|Elderton|1902}}, collected in {{Harv|Pearson|1914|pp=xxxi\u2013xxxiii, 26\u201328|loc=Table XII}}.\n\nThe use of the ''p''-value in statistics was popularized by [[Ronald Fisher]],{{sfn|Inman|2004}} and it plays a central role in his approach to the subject.{{sfn|Hubbard|Bayarri|2003|p=1}} In his influential book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' (1925), Fisher proposed the level ''p'' = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for [[statistical significance]], and applied this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance (see [[68\u201395\u201399.7 rule]]).{{sfn|Fisher|1925|p=47|loc=Chapter [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Fisher/Methods/chap3.htm III. Distributions]}}{{NoteTag| 1 = To be precise the ''p'' = 0.05 corresponds to about 1.96 standard deviations for a normal distribution (two-tailed test), and 2 standard deviations corresponds to about a 1 in 22 chance of being exceeded by chance, or ''p'' \u2248 0.045; Fisher notes these approximations.}}{{sfn|Dallal|2012|loc=Note 31: [http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/p05.htm Why P=0.05?]}}\n\nHe then computed a table of values, similar to Elderton but, importantly, reversed the roles of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> and ''p.'' That is, rather than computing ''p'' for different values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> (and degrees of freedom ''n''), he computed values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> that yield specified ''p''-values, specifically 0.99, 0.98, 0.95, 0,90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.50, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01.{{sfn|Fisher|1925|pp=78\u201379, 98|loc=Chapter [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Fisher/Methods/chap4.htm IV.

Table of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>]}} That allowed computed values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> to be compared against cutoffs and encouraged the use of ''p''-values (especially 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01) as cutoffs, instead of computing and reporting ''p''-values themselves. The same type of tables were then compiled in {{Harv|Fisher|Yates|1938}}, which cemented the approach.{{sfn|Dallal|2012|loc=Note 31: [http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/p05.htm Why P=0.05?]}}\n\nAs an illustration of the application of ''p''-values to the design and interpretation of experiments, in his following book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' (1935), Fisher presented the [[lady tasting tea]] experiment,{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment}} which is the archetypal example of the ''p''-value.\n\nTo evaluate a lady's claim that she ([[Muriel Bristol]]) could distinguish by taste how tea is prepared (first adding the milk to the cup, then the tea, or first tea, then milk), she was sequentially presented with 8 cups: 4 prepared one way, 4 prepared the other, and asked to determine the preparation of each cup (knowing that there were 4 of each). In that case, the null hypothesis was that she had no special ability, the test was [[Fisher's exact test]], and the ''p''-value was <math>1/\\binom{8}{4} = 1/70 \\approx 0.014,</math> so Fisher was willing to reject the null hypothesis (consider the outcome highly unlikely to be due to chance) if all were classified correctly. (In the actual experiment, Bristol correctly classified all 8 cups.)\n\nFisher reiterated the ''p'' = 0.05 threshold and explained its rationale, stating:{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 7. The Test of Significance}}\n{{quotation\n|It is usual and convenient for experimenters to take 5 per cent as a standard level of significance, in the sense that they are prepared to ignore all results which fail to reach this standard, and, by this means, to eliminate from further discussion the greater part of the fluctuations which chance causes have introduced into their experimental results.}}\nHe also applies this threshold to the design of experiments, noting that had only 6 cups been presented (3 of each), a perfect classification would have only yielded a ''p''-value of <math>1/\\binom{6}{3} = 1/20 = 0.05,</math> which would not have met this level of significance.{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 7. The Test of Significance}} Fisher also underlined the interpretation of ''p,'' as the long-run proportion of values at least as extreme as the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nIn later editions, Fisher explicitly contrasted the use of the ''p''-value for statistical inference in science with the Neyman\u2013Pearson method, which he terms \"Acceptance Procedures\".{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 12.1 Scientific Inference and Acceptance Procedures}} Fisher emphasizes that while fixed levels such as 5%, 2%, and 1% are convenient, the exact ''p''-value can be used, and the strength of evidence can and will be revised with further experimentation. In contrast, decision procedures require a clear-cut decision, yielding an irreversible action, and the procedure is based on costs of error, which, he argues, are inapplicable to scientific research.\n\n== Related quantities ==\nA closely related concept is the E-value,<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=FAQ#expect National Institutes of Health definition of E-value]</ref> which is the [[Conditional expectation|expected]] number of times in [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] that one expects to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true.

If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statistical test is to verify whether this hypothesis is not false, but not, at the same time, to investigate other hypotheses, then such a test is called a ''significance test''. A statistical hypothesis that refers only to the numerical values of unknown parameters of a distribution is called a ''parametric hypothesis''. Methods of verifying statistical hypotheses are called ''statistical tests''. Tests of parametric hypotheses are called ''parametric tests''.<ref name=\"Fisz\">{{cite book |last= Fisz |first= Marek |title = Probability theory and mathematical statistics |edition = 3 |chapter = Significance Testing |page = 425 |publisher= John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |year = 1963 | location = New York }}</ref> We can likewise also have ''non-parametric hypotheses'' and ''non-parametric tests''. \n\nThe ''p''-value is used in the context of [[null hypothesis]] testing in order to quantify the idea of [[statistical significance]] of evidence.{{NoteTag|Note that the statistical significance of a result does not imply that the result is scientifically significant as well.{{what|Please clarify what \"scientifically significant\" means for a layman.|date=March 2020}}}} Null hypothesis testing is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument adapted to statistics. In essence, a claim is assumed valid if its counter-claim is improbable.\n\nAs such, the only hypothesis that needs to be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim is referred to as the [[null hypothesis]] (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified). A result is said to be ''statistically significant'' if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. The rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis. However, unless there is a single alternative to the null hypothesis, the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.\n\nAs a general example, if a null hypothesis states that a certain summary statistic follows the standard [[normal distribution]] N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the [[variance]] is not unity,{{what|Please clarify what \"unity\" means for a layman.|date=March 2020}} or (iii) the distribution is not normal, depending on the type of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.\n\nIf <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]] representing the observed data and <math>H</math> is the statistical hypothesis under consideration, then the notion of statistical significance can be naively quantified by the [[conditional probability]] <math>\\Pr(X|H)</math>, which gives the likelihood of a certain observation event ''X'' if the hypothesis is ''assumed'' to be correct. However, if <math>X</math> is a continuous random variable, the probability of observing a specific instance <math>x</math> is zero, that is, <math>\\Pr(X=x|H)=0.</math> Thus, this naive definition is inadequate and needs to be changed so as to accommodate the continuous random variables.\n\nNonetheless, it helps to clarify that ''p''-values should '''not''' be confused with probability on hypothesis (as is done in [[Bayes factor|Bayesian hypothesis testing]]) such as <math>\\Pr(H|X),</math> the probability of the hypothesis given the data, or <math>\\Pr(H),</math> the probability of the hypothesis being true, given <math>\\Pr(X),</math> the probability of observing the given data.\n\n== Definition and interpretation ==\n=== General ===\n[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|thumb|right|400 px|Example of a ''p''-value computation. The vertical coordinate is the [[probability density function|probability density]] of each outcome, computed under the null hypothesis. The ''p''-value is the area under the curve past the observed data point.]]\n\nThe ''p''-value is defined as the probability, under the [[null hypothesis]] <math>H</math> (at times denoted <math>H_0</math> as opposed to <math>H_\\mathrm{a}</math> denoting the alternative hypothesis) about the unknown distribution <math>F</math> of the random variable <math>X</math>, for the variate to be observed as a value equal to or more extreme than the value observed. If <math>x</math> is the observed value, then depending on how we interpret it, the \"equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed\" can mean <math>\\{ X \\geq x \\}</math> (right-tail event), <math>\\{ X \\leq x \\}</math> (left-tail event) or the event giving the smallest probability among <math>\\{ X \\leq x\\}</math> and <math>\\{ X \\geq x \\}</math> (double-tailed event). Thus, the ''p''-value is given by\n* <math>\\Pr(X \\geq x |H)</math> for right tail event,\n* <math>\\Pr(X \\leq x |H)</math> for left tail event,\n* <math>2\\min\\{\\Pr(X \\leq x |H),\\Pr(X \\geq x |H)\\}</math> for double tail event.\n\nThe smaller the ''p''-value, the higher the significance because it tells the investigator that the hypothesis under consideration may not adequately explain the observation. The null hypothesis <math>H</math> is rejected if any of these probabilities is less than or equal to a small, fixed but arbitrarily pre-defined threshold value <math>\\alpha</math>, which is referred to as the [[statistical significance|level of significance]]. Unlike the ''p''-value, the <math>\\alpha</math> level is not derived from any observational data and does not depend on the underlying hypothesis; the value of <math>\\alpha</math> is instead set by the researcher before examining the data. The setting of <math>\\alpha</math> is arbitrary. By convention, <math>\\alpha</math> is commonly set to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001.\n\nBecause the value of <math>x</math> that defines the left tail or right tail event is a random variable, this makes the ''p''-value a function of <math>x</math> and a [[random variable]] in itself; under the null hypothesis, the ''p''-value is defined uniformly over <math>[0,1]</math> interval, assuming <math>x</math> is continuous. Thus, the ''p''-value is not fixed. This implies that ''p''-value cannot be given a frequency counting interpretation since the probability has to be fixed for the frequency counting interpretation to hold. In other words, if the same test is repeated independently bearing upon the same overall null hypothesis, it will yield different ''p''-values at every repetition. Nevertheless, these different ''p''-values can be combined, for instance using [[Fisher's combined probability test]]. It should further be noted that an ''instantiation'' of this random ''p''-value can still be given a frequency counting interpretation with respect to the number of observations taken during a given test, as per the definition, as the percentage of observations more extreme than the one observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n=== Distribution ===\nWhen the null hypothesis is true, if it takes the form <math> H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0</math>, and the underlying random variable is continuous, then the [[probability distribution]] of the ''p''-value is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] on the interval [0,1].

In contrast, in a ''composite hypothesis'' the parameter's value is given by a set of numbers. While the above definition is satisfactory for a simple hypothesis, we need to be more cautious when dealing with compound hypotheses. For example, when testing the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal with a mean less than or equal to zero against the alternative that the mean is greater than zero (variance known), the null hypothesis does not specify the probability distribution of the appropriate test statistic. In the just mentioned example that would be the ''Z''-statistic belonging to the one-sided one-sample ''Z''-test. For each possible value of the theoretical mean, the ''Z''-test statistic has a different probability distribution. In these circumstances (the case of a so-called composite null hypothesis) the ''p''-value is defined by taking the least favourable null-hypothesis case, which is typically on the border between null and alternative.\n\n=== Misconceptions ===\n{{Main|Misuse of p-values}}\nAccording to the ASA, there is widespread agreement that ''p''-values are often [[Misunderstandings of p-values|misused and misinterpreted]].<ref name=\"ASA\" /> One practice that has been particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any ''p''-value nominally less than .05 without other supporting evidence. Although ''p''-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as \"the design of a study, the quality of the measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis\".<ref name=\"ASA\" /> Another concern is that the ''p''-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true.<ref name=\"ASA\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Colquhoun |first1=David |title = An investigation of the

In this method, as part of [[experimental design]], before performing the experiment, one first chooses a model (the [[null hypothesis]]) and a threshold value for ''p'', called the [[significance level]] of the test, traditionally 5% or 1%<ref name=\"nature506\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/506150a| pmid = 24522584| title = Scientific method: Statistical errors| journal = Nature| volume = 506| issue = 7487| pages = 150\u2013152| year = 2014| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R. | bibcode = 2014Natur.506..150N}}</ref> and denoted as ''\u03b1''. If the ''p''-value is less than the chosen significance level (''\u03b1''), that suggests that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the [[null hypothesis]] and that the null hypothesis may be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is true. When the ''p''-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the [[type I error rate]] is at most ''\u03b1''{{Explain|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. For typical analysis, using the standard ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when ''p'' < .05 and not rejected when ''p'' > .05. The ''p''-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n== Calculation ==\nUsually, <math>X</math> is a [[test statistic]], rather than any of the actual observations. A test statistic is the output of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function of all the observations. This statistic provides a single number, such as the average or the [[correlation coefficient]], that summarizes the characteristics of the data, in a way relevant to a particular inquiry. As such, the test statistic follows a distribution determined by the function used to define that test statistic and the distribution of the input observational data.\n\nFor the important case in which the data are hypothesized to follow the normal distribution, depending on the nature of the test statistic and thus the underlying hypothesis of the test statistic, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are [[z-test]] for [[normal distribution]], [[t-test]] for [[Student's t-distribution]], [[f-test]] for [[f-distribution]]. When the data do not follow a normal distribution, it can still be possible to approximate the distribution of these test statistics by a normal distribution by invoking the [[central limit theorem]] for large samples, as in the case of [[Pearson's chi-squared test]].\n\nThus computing a ''p''-value requires a null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a [[one-tailed test]] or a [[two-tailed test]]), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), but, in the early and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated ''p''-values from these discrete values{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Rather than using a table of ''p''-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed ''p''-values; this corresponds to computing the [[quantile function]] (inverse CDF).\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Coin flipping===\n{{Main|Checking whether a coin is fair}}\n\nAs an example of a statistical test, an experiment is performed to determine whether a [[coin flipping|coin flip]] is [[fair coin|fair]] (equal chance of landing heads or tails) or unfairly biased (one outcome being more likely than the other).\n\nSuppose that the experimental results show the coin turning up heads 14 times out of 20 total flips. The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and the test statistic is the number of heads. If a right-tailed test is considered, the ''p''-value of this result is the chance of a fair coin landing on heads ''at least'' 14 times out of 20 flips. That probability can be computed from [[binomial coefficient]]s as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\operatorname{Prob}(14\\text{ heads}) + \\operatorname{Prob}(15\\text{ heads}) +  \\cdots + \\operatorname{Prob}(20\\text{ heads}) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2^{20}} \\left[ \\binom{20}{14} + \\binom{20}{15} + \\cdots + \\binom{20}{20} \\right] = \\frac{60,\\!460}{1,\\!048,\\!576} \\approx 0.058\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis probability is the ''p''-value, considering only extreme results that favor heads. This is called a [[One- and two-tailed tests|one-tailed test]]. However, the deviation can be in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed ''p''-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the [[binomial distribution]] is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided ''p''-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided ''p''-value: the two-sided ''p''-value is 0.115.\n\nIn the above example:\n* Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): The coin is fair, with Prob(heads) = 0.5\n* Test statistic: Number of heads\n* Alpha level (designated threshold of significance): 0.05\n* Observation O: 14 heads out of 20 flips; and\n* Two-tailed ''p''-value of observation O given H<sub>0</sub> = 2*min(Prob(no. of heads \u2265&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads), Prob(no. of heads \u2264&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads))= 2*min(0.058, 0.978) = 2*0.058 = 0.115.<!-- Note we've summed the exact values not the rounded values.  Correct value = 0.1153183... -->\n\nNote that the Prob (no. of heads \u2264&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads) = 1 - Prob(no. of heads \u2265&nbsp;14&nbsp;heads) + Prob (no. of head = 14) = 1 - 0.058 + 0.036 = 0.978; however, symmetry of the binomial distribution makes it an unnecessary computation to find the smaller of the two probabilities. Here, the calculated ''p''-value exceeds .05, meaning that the data falls within the range of what would happen 95% of the time were the coin in fact fair.

The statistics showed an excess of boys compared to girls. He concluded by calculation of a ''p''-value that the excess was a real, but unexplained, effect.}}\n\nThe ''p''-value was first formally introduced by [[Karl Pearson]], in his [[Pearson's chi-squared test]],{{sfn|Pearson|1900}} using the [[chi-squared distribution]] and notated as capital P.{{sfn|Pearson|1900}} The ''p''-values for the [[chi-squared distribution]] (for various values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> and degrees of freedom), now notated as ''P,'' was calculated in {{Harv|Elderton|1902}}, collected in {{Harv|Pearson|1914|pp=xxxi\u2013xxxiii, 26\u201328|loc=Table XII}}.\n\nThe use of the ''p''-value in statistics was popularized by [[Ronald Fisher]],{{sfn|Inman|2004}} and it plays a central role in his approach to the subject.{{sfn|Hubbard|Bayarri|2003|p=1}} In his influential book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' (1925), Fisher proposed the level ''p'' = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for [[statistical significance]], and applied this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance (see [[68\u201395\u201399.7 rule]]).{{sfn|Fisher|1925|p=47|loc=Chapter [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Fisher/Methods/chap3.htm III. Distributions]}}{{NoteTag| 1 = To be precise the ''p'' = 0.05 corresponds to about 1.96 standard deviations for a normal distribution (two-tailed test), and 2 standard deviations corresponds to about a 1 in 22 chance of being exceeded by chance, or ''p'' \u2248 0.045; Fisher notes these approximations.}}{{sfn|Dallal|2012|loc=Note 31: [http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/p05.htm Why P=0.05?]}}\n\nHe then computed a table of values, similar to Elderton but, importantly, reversed the roles of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> and ''p.'' That is, rather than computing ''p'' for different values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> (and degrees of freedom ''n''), he computed values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> that yield specified ''p''-values, specifically 0.99, 0.98, 0.95, 0,90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.50, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01.{{sfn|Fisher|1925|pp=78\u201379, 98|loc=Chapter [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Fisher/Methods/chap4.htm IV.

Table of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>]}} That allowed computed values of ''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> to be compared against cutoffs and encouraged the use of ''p''-values (especially 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01) as cutoffs, instead of computing and reporting ''p''-values themselves. The same type of tables were then compiled in {{Harv|Fisher|Yates|1938}}, which cemented the approach.{{sfn|Dallal|2012|loc=Note 31: [http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/p05.htm Why P=0.05?]}}\n\nAs an illustration of the application of ''p''-values to the design and interpretation of experiments, in his following book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' (1935), Fisher presented the [[lady tasting tea]] experiment,{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment}} which is the archetypal example of the ''p''-value.\n\nTo evaluate a lady's claim that she ([[Muriel Bristol]]) could distinguish by taste how tea is prepared (first adding the milk to the cup, then the tea, or first tea, then milk), she was sequentially presented with 8 cups: 4 prepared one way, 4 prepared the other, and asked to determine the preparation of each cup (knowing that there were 4 of each). In that case, the null hypothesis was that she had no special ability, the test was [[Fisher's exact test]], and the ''p''-value was <math>1/\\binom{8}{4} = 1/70 \\approx 0.014,</math> so Fisher was willing to reject the null hypothesis (consider the outcome highly unlikely to be due to chance) if all were classified correctly. (In the actual experiment, Bristol correctly classified all 8 cups.)\n\nFisher reiterated the ''p'' = 0.05 threshold and explained its rationale, stating:{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 7. The Test of Significance}}\n{{quotation\n|It is usual and convenient for experimenters to take 5 per cent as a standard level of significance, in the sense that they are prepared to ignore all results which fail to reach this standard, and, by this means, to eliminate from further discussion the greater part of the fluctuations which chance causes have introduced into their experimental results.}}\nHe also applies this threshold to the design of experiments, noting that had only 6 cups been presented (3 of each), a perfect classification would have only yielded a ''p''-value of <math>1/\\binom{6}{3} = 1/20 = 0.05,</math> which would not have met this level of significance.{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 7. The Test of Significance}} Fisher also underlined the interpretation of ''p,'' as the long-run proportion of values at least as extreme as the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nIn later editions, Fisher explicitly contrasted the use of the ''p''-value for statistical inference in science with the Neyman\u2013Pearson method, which he terms \"Acceptance Procedures\".{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Section 12.1 Scientific Inference and Acceptance Procedures}} Fisher emphasizes that while fixed levels such as 5%, 2%, and 1% are convenient, the exact ''p''-value can be used, and the strength of evidence can and will be revised with further experimentation. In contrast, decision procedures require a clear-cut decision, yielding an irreversible action, and the procedure is based on costs of error, which, he argues, are inapplicable to scientific research.\n\n== Related quantities ==\nA closely related concept is the E-value,<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=FAQ#expect National Institutes of Health definition of E-value]</ref> which is the [[Conditional expectation|expected]] number of times in [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] that one expects to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true. The E-value is the product of the number of tests and the ''p''-value.\n\nThe [[Q-value (statistics)|''q''-value]] is the analog of the ''p''-value with respect to the [[False discovery rate#Related concepts|positive false discovery rate]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Storey|first=John D|date=2003|title=The positive false discovery rate: a Bayesian interpretation and the q-value|journal=The Annals of Statistics|volume=31|issue=6|pages=2013\u20132035|doi=10.1214/aos/1074290335}}</ref> It is used in [[Multiple comparisons problem|multiple hypothesis testing]] to maintain statistical power while minimizing the [[false positive rate]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Storey|first=John D|last2=Tibshirani|first2=Robert|date=2003|title=Statistical significance for genomewide studies|journal=PNAS|volume=100|issue=16|pages=9440\u20139445|pmc=170937|pmid=12883005|doi=10.1073/pnas.1530509100|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.9440S}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bonferroni correction]]\n*[[Confidence interval]]\n*[[Counternull]]\n*[[False discovery rate]]\n*[[Fisher's method|Fisher's method of combining ''p''-values]]\n*[[Generalized p-value|Generalized ''p''-value]]\n*[[Holm\u2013Bonferroni method]]\n*[[Multiple comparisons]]\n*[[Null hypothesis]]\n*[[p-rep|''p''-rep]]\n*[[p-value fallacy|''p''-value fallacy]]\n*[[Statistical hypothesis testing]]\n*[[Q-value (statistics)|''q''-value]]\n*[[Harmonic mean p-value|Harmonic mean ''p''-value]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Lydia Denworth, \"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire.

Climate in south India is generally hotter than north India. Most part of the nation doesn't experience temperatures below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F) even in winter the temperature exceeds 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) during summer across the nation. Based on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen system]], [[India]] hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid deserts in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different [[microclimate]]s, making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (January and February), summer (March, April and May), [[monsoon]] (rainy) season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to December).\n\nIndia's [[geography of India|geography]] and [[geology of India|geology]] are climatically pivotal: the [[Thar Desert]] in the northwest and the [[Himalayas]] in the north work in tandem to create a [[Culture of India|culturally]] and [[Economy of India|economically]] important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid [[katabatic wind]]s from the icy [[Tibetan Plateau]] and northerly Central Asia. Most of [[North India]] is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.\n\nThough the [[Tropic of Cancer]]\u2014the boundary between the tropics and subtropics\u2014passes through the middle of India, the bulk of the country can be regarded as climatically tropical. As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather patterns in India can be wildly unstable: epochal droughts, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters are sporadic, but have displaced or ended millions of human lives. There is one scientific opinion which states that in South Asia such climatic events are likely [[effects of global warming on South Asia|to change in unpredictability, frequency, and severity]]. Ongoing and future vegetative changes and [[current sea level rise]]s and the attendant inundation of India's low-lying coastal areas are other impacts, current or predicted, that are attributable to [[global warming]].{{Sfn|Ravindranath|Bala|Sharma|2011}}\n<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Kalinagar Floods B.JPG|thumb|Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by [[monsoon]] in [[West Bengal]]]]\n[[File:Teestavalley.jpg|thumb|[[Indian highways|National Highway]] [[List of National Highways in India|31A]] winds along the banks of the [[Teesta River]] near [[Kalimpong]], in the [[Darjeeling]] Himalayan hill region in [[West Bengal]].]]\n[[File:India-view of shilla.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a chain of snow-capped mountains.

Despite its position within a high-latitude belt at 55\u201375\u00b0&nbsp;S\u2014latitudes now occupied by parts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35\u00b0&nbsp;N\u2014India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-deined seasons.{{Sfn|Chumakov|Zharkov|2003}} India later merged into the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], a process beginning some 550\u2013500&nbsp;Ma. During the Late [[Paleozoic]], Gondwana extended from a point at or near the [[South Pole]] to near the equator, where the [[Indian craton]] (stable [[continental crust]]) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-[[biomass]] [[ecosystems]]. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves\u2014much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence\u2014the fourth-largest reserves in the world.{{Sfn|CIA World Factbook}} During the [[Mesozoic]], the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the [[Carboniferous]], [[global cooling]] stoked extensive [[glaciation]], which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the [[Permian]].{{Sfn|Grossman et al.|2002}}\n\n[[Plate tectonics|Tectonic movement]] by the [[Indian Plate]] caused it to pass over a geologic [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]\u2014the [[R\u00e9union hotspot]]\u2014now occupied by the volcanic island of [[R\u00e9union]]. This resulted in a massive [[flood basalt]] event that laid down the [[Deccan Traps]] some 60\u201368&nbsp;Ma,{{Sfn|Sheth|2006}}{{Sfn|Iwata|Takahashi|Arai|1997}} at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. This may have contributed to the global [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], which caused India to experience significantly reduced [[insolation]]. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed [[aerosol]]s such as [[sulphur dioxide]] and [[sulphuric acid]], similar to those found in the [[atmosphere of Venus]]; these precipitated as [[acid rain]]. Elevated [[carbon dioxide]] emissions also contributed to the [[greenhouse effect]], causing [[climate change|warmer weather]] that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the [[Laurasia]]n landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.{{Sfn|Karanth|2006}} The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.{{Sfn|Wolpert|1999|p=4}}<!--<ref>{{Citation|title=Water Resources of India: Physiographic Conditions|publisher=Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India}}</ref>-->\n\n==Regions==\n{{Main|Climatic regions of India}}\n{| align=\"right\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:India average annual temperature map en.svg|thumb|upright|alt=\"India Average Temperature Map\": A map of India overlaid with five zones.

The nation's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert.{{Sfn|Chang|1967}} The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar [[latitude]]s.{{Sfn|Posey|1994|p=118}} Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.{{Sfn|Chang|1967}}{{Sfn|NCERT|p=28}} Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall seven climatic zones that, as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation.{{Sfn|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p=97}} Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system.\n\n===Tropical wet===\nA tropical rainy climate governs regions experiencing persistent warm or high temperatures, which normally do not fall below {{Convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. India hosts two climatic subtypes- [[tropical monsoon climate]], [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]]  that fall under this group.\n\n1) The most humid is the tropical wet climate\u2014also known as [[tropical monsoon climate]]\u2014that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the [[Malabar Coast]], the [[Western Ghats]], and southern Assam. India's two island territories, Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, are also subject to this climate. Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy\u2014typically above {{Convert|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year.{{Sfn|Chouhan|1992|p=7}} Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this moisture is enough to sustain lush forests and other vegetation for the rest of the mainly dry year. December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare. The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the exceptional biodiversity of tropical wet forests in parts of these regions.\n\n2) In India a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] is more common. Noticeably drier than areas with a tropical monsoon climate, it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi arid [[rain shadow]] east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long and dry periods with temperatures averaging above {{Convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Summer is exceedingly hot; temperatures in low-lying areas may exceed {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} during May, leading to heat waves that can each kill hundreds of Indians.{{Sfn|Farooq|2002}}The rainy season lasts from June to September; annual rainfall averages between {{Convert|750|\u2013|1500|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry.\n\nThe Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone: it receives between {{Convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall each year in the western part, and {{Convert|2000|to|3000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the eastern part. The coolest month of the year, on average, is January; April and May are the warmest months. Average temperatures in January range from {{Convert|14|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}, and average temperatures in April range from {{Convert|25|to|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}.

The region, which includes Karnataka, inland Tamil Nadu, western Andhra Pradesh, and central Maharashtra, gets between {{Convert|400|\u2013|750|mm|1}} annually. It is drought-prone, as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to sporadic lateness or failure of the southwest monsoon.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=124}} Karnataka is divided into three zones \u2013 coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about 3,638.5&nbsp;mm per annum, far in excess of the state average of 1,139&nbsp;mm (45&nbsp;in). In contrast to norm, Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India. North of the [[Krishna River]], the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall; to the south, significant post-monsoon rainfall also occurs in October and November. In December, the coldest month, temperatures still average around {{Convert|20|\u2013|24|C|F}}. The months between March to May are hot and dry; mean monthly temperatures hover around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, with {{Convert|320|mm|in|0}}precipitation. Hence, without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture.\n\n[[File:Thar Desert Sunset Rajasthan India.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=View of dunes at sunset. The setting sun hangs low and dim in a sky graded from fiery orange at top to maroon near the horizon. Terrestrial features are difficult to discern in the crepuscular illumination.|The [[Thar Desert]]]]\n\n2) Most of western Rajasthan experiences an '''arid climatic regime''' ([[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|Hot desert climate]]). [[Cloudburst]]s are responsible for virtually all of the region's annual precipitation, which totals less than {{Convert|300|mm|in|1}}. Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July, August, and September. Such rainfall is highly erratic; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so. Atmospheric moisture is largely prevented from precipitating due to continuous [[vertical draft|downdrafts]] and other factors.{{Sfn|Singhvi|Kar|2004}} The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around {{Convert|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, with daily maxima occasionally topping {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. During winters, temperatures in some areas can drop below freezing due to waves of cold air from Central Asia. There is a large diurnal range of about {{Convert|14|C-change|1}} during summer; this widens by several degrees during winter.\n[[File:Dust Strom in India.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dust storm in the [[Thar Desert]]]]\n\nTo the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate conditions prevail. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29&nbsp;\u00b0C (84&nbsp;\u00b0F) and nights around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (106&nbsp;\u00b0F) and nights no lower than 29&nbsp;\u00b0C (84&nbsp;\u00b0F). In the weeks before the monsoon temperatures are similar to the above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (81&nbsp;\u00b0F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.\n\n3) East of the Thar Desert, the Punjab-Haryana-Kathiawar region experiences a '''tropical and sub-tropical steppe climate'''. Haryana's climate resembles other states of the northern plains: extreme summer heat of up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter cold as low as 1&nbsp;\u00b0C. May and June are hottest; December and January are coldest. Rainfall is varied, with the Shivalik Hills region being the wettest and the Aravali Hills region being the driest. About 80% of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season of July\u2013September, which can cause flooding. The Punjabi climate is also governed by extremes of hot and cold. Areas near the Himalayan foothills receive heavy rainfall whereas those eloigned from them are hot and dry. Punjab's three-season climate sees summer months that span from mid-April to the end of June. Temperatures typically range from\u20132&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, but can reach 47&nbsp;\u00b0C (117&nbsp;\u00b0F) in summer and \u22124&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter. Most part of the nation doesn't experience temperatures below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F) even in winter. The zone, a transitional climatic region separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical savanna and forests, experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert. Average annual rainfall is {{Convert|300|\u2013|650|mm|in|1}}, but is very unreliable; as in much of the rest of India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation. Daily summer temperature maxima rise to around {{Convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}; this results in natural vegetation typically comprising short, coarse grasses.\n\n===Subtropical humid===\nMost of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Though they experience hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Due to ample monsoon rains, India has only one subtype of this climate under the [[Humid subtropical climate#South Asia|K\u00f6ppen system: ''Cwa''.]]{{Sfn|Kimmel|2000}} In most of this region, there is very little precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia.\n\nHumid subtropical regions are subject to pronounced dry winters. Winter rainfall\u2014and occasionally snowfall\u2014is associated with large storm systems such as \"Nor'westers\" and \"[[Western disturbances]]\"; the latter are steered by [[westerlies]] towards the Himalayas.{{Sfn|Das et al.|2002}} Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon; occasional [[tropical cyclones]] also contribute. Annual rainfall ranges from less than {{Convert|1000|mm|in|0}} in the west to over {{Convert|2500|mm|in|0}} in parts of the northeast. As most of this region is far from the ocean, the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a [[continental climate]] predominate; the swings are wider than in those in tropical wet regions, ranging from {{Convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in north-central India to {{Convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in the east.\n\n===Mountain===\n[[File:Pangong Tso lake.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a large body of water standing before a prominent peak, which communicates with several others partly out of view and behind.

Patchy snowcover defines their recesses, and whitish vein-like streaks extend up from the base of the largest.|[[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] in [[Ladakh]], an [[arid]] montane region lying deep within the Himalayas.]]\n\nIndia's northernmost areas are subject to a montane, or alpine, climate. In the Himalayas, the rate at which an air mass's temperature falls per kilometre (3,281&nbsp;ft) of altitude gained (the [[lapse rate|dry adiabatic lapse rate]]) is 9.8&nbsp;\u00b0C/km.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2005}} In terms of [[environmental lapse rate]], ambient temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{Convert|1000|m|ft|0}} rise in altitude. Thus, climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the [[snow line]] can coexist within several hundred metres of each other. Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes, high diurnal temperature variability, temperature inversions, and altitude-dependent variability in rainfall are also common.\n\nThe northern side of the western Himalayas, also known as the trans-Himalayan belt, has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. It is a region of barren, '''arid, frigid'''  and wind-blown wastelands. Areas south of the Himalayas are largely protected from cold winter winds coming in from the Asian interior. The leeward side (northern face) of the mountains receives less rain.\n\nThe southern slopes of the western Himalayas, well-exposed to the monsoon, get heavy rainfall.  Areas situated at elevations of 1,070\u20132,290 metres (3,510\u20137,510&nbsp;ft) receive the heaviest rainfall, which decreases rapidly at elevations above {{Convert|2290|m|ft|0}}. Most precipitation occurs as snowfall during the late winter and spring months.The Himalayas experience their heaviest snowfall between December and February and at elevations above {{Convert|1500|m|ft|0}}. Snowfall increases with elevation by up to several dozen millimetres per 100&nbsp;metre (~2&nbsp;in; 330&nbsp;ft) increase. Elevations above {{Convert|6000|m|ft|0}} never experience rain; all precipitation falls as snow.{{Sfn|Singh|Kumar|1997}}\n\n==Seasons==\n[[File:Fort Bandhavgarh National Park Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a small marshy lake surrounded by dry brush in winter.

The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around {{Convert|10|\u2013|15|C|F}} in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around {{Convert|20|\u2013|25|C|F}} in mainland India's southeast.\n* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to May. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\nThe Himalayan states, being more temperate, experience an additional season, ''spring'', which coincides with the first weeks of summer in southern India. Traditionally, North Indians note six seasons or ''Ritu'', each about two months long. These are the spring season (''{{Lang-sa|vasanta}}''), summer (''gr\u012b\u1e63ma''), monsoon season (''var\u1e63\u0101''), autumn (''\u015barada''), winter (''hemanta''), and prevernal season<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> (''\u015bi\u015bira''). These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts. The ancient [[Hindu calendar]] also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.\n\n=== Winter ===\n[[File:Gulmarg.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view looking down from a snowy ridge onto a mountain valley far below, lost in mist.

As the Sun's vertical rays move south of the equator, most of the country experiences moderately cool weather. December and January are the coldest months, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the Indian Himalayas. Temperatures are higher in the east and south.\n\nIn northwestern India region, virtually cloudless conditions prevail in October and November, resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings; as in much of the Deccan Plateau, they register at 16\u201320&nbsp;\u00b0C (61\u201368&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, from January to February, \"western disturbances\" bring heavy bursts of rain and snow. These extra-tropical [[low pressure area|low-pressure systems]] originate in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.{{Sfn|Hatwar|Yadav|Rama Rao|2005}} They are carried towards India by the subtropical [[westerlies]], which are the prevailing winds blowing at North India's range of latitude.{{Sfn|Das et al.|2002}} Once their passage is hindered by the Himalayas, they are unable to proceed further, and they release significant precipitation over the southern Himalayas.\n\nThere is a huge variation in the climatic conditions of Himachal Pradesh due to variation in altitude (450\u20136500 metres). The climate varies from hot and subtropical humid (450\u2013900 meters) in the southern low tracts, warm and temperate (900\u20131800 metres), cool and temperate (1900\u20132400 metres) and cold glacial and alpine (2400\u20134800 meters) in the northern and eastern elevated mountain ranges. By October, nights and mornings are very cold. Snowfall at elevations of nearly 3000 m is about 3 m and lasts from December start to March end. Elevations above 4500 m support perpetual snow. The spring season starts from mid February to mid April. The weather is pleasant and comfortable in the season. The rainy season starts at the end of the month of June. The landscape lushes green and fresh. During the season streams and natural springs are replenished. The heavy rains in July and August cause a lot of damage resulting in erosion, floods and landslides. Out of all the state districts, Dharamsala receives the highest rainfall, nearly about {{Convert|3400|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Spiti is the driest area of the state, where annual rainfall is below 50&nbsp;mm.{{Sfn|Hara|Kimura|Yasunari}} The five Himalayan states (Jammu and Kashmir in the extreme north, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh) and Northern West Bengal experience heavy snowfall, Manipur and Nagaland are not located in the Himalayas but experience occasional snowfall; in Jammu and Kashmir, [[blizzard]]s occur regularly, disrupting travel and other activities.\n\nThe rest of North India, including the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] almost never receives snow. Temperatures in the plains occasionally fall below freezing, though never for more than one or two days. Winter highs in Delhi range from {{Convert|16|to|21|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. Nighttime temperatures average {{Convert|2|\u2013|8|C|F}}.

In Bihar in middle of the Ganges plain, hot weather sets in and the summer lasts until the middle of June. The highest temperature is often registered in May which is the hottest time. Like the rest of the north, Bihar also experiences dust-storms, thunderstorms and dust raising winds during the hot season. Dust storms having a velocity of {{Convert|48|\u2013|64|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} are most frequent in May and with second maximum in April and June. The hot winds (loo) of [[Bihar]] plains blow during April and May with an average velocity of {{Convert|8|\u2013|16|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. These hot winds greatly affect human comfort during this season. Rain follows.{{Sfn|Government of Bihar}} The rainy season begins in June. The rainiest months are July and August. The rains are the gifts of the southwest monsoon. There are in Bihar three distinct areas where rainfall exceeds {{Convert|1800|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Two of them are in the northern and northwestern portions of the state; the third lies in the area around [[Netarhat]]. The southwest monsoon normally withdraws from Bihar in the first week of October.{{Sfn|Air India|2003}} Eastern India's climate is much milder, experiencing moderately warm days and cool nights.

It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from travelling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region instead. The Himalayas are indeed believed to play an important role in the formation of Central Asian deserts such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]]. The mountain ranges prevent western winter disturbances in Iran from travelling further east, resulting in much snow in Kashmir and rainfall for parts of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and northern India. Despite the Himalayas being a barrier to the cold northerly winter winds, the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds, thus lowering the temperature in Northeast India and Bangladesh. The Himalayas, which are often called \"The Roof of the World\", contain the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles. Ten of Asia's largest rivers flow from there. The two Himalayan states in the east, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, receive substantial snowfall. The extreme north of [[West Bengal]] centred on [[Darjeeling]] experiences snowfall, but only rarely.\n\nIn [[South India]], particularly the hinterlands of Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, somewhat cooler weather prevails. Minimum temperatures in western Maharashtra and [[Chhattisgarh]] hover around {{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}; in the southern Deccan Plateau, they reach {{Convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}.

The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer. The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April; for most of North India, it is May. Temperatures of {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season. Another striking feature of summer is the [[Loo (wind)]]. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds that blow during the day in  India. Direct exposure to these winds may be fatal.{{Sfn|Farooq|2002}} In cooler regions of North India, immense pre-monsoon [[squall]]-line thunderstorms, known locally as \"Nor'westers\", commonly drop large hailstones. In Himachal Pradesh, Summer lasts from mid April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in [[Alpine climate|alpine]] zone which experience mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from {{Convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} to {{Convert|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}.

The void left by the jet stream, which switches from a route just south of the Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Burns et al.|2003}} This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}} This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]'s [[orogeny|uplift]], which accompanied the [[Eocene]]\u2013[[Oligocene]] transition event, a major episode of global cooling and [[aridification]] which occurred 34\u201349&nbsp;Ma.{{Sfn|Dupont-Nivet et al.|2007}}\n\nThe southwest monsoon arrives in two branches: the [[Bay of Bengal]] branch and the [[Arabian Sea]] branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the [[Malabar Coast]] of Kerala.{{Sfn|India Meteorological Department|A}} By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from [[Cape Comorin]] to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By the first week of July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view over a city: de-laminating concrete housing blocks surrounded by rough slum tenements.

Weak or failed monsoons (droughts) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth.{{Sfn|Vaswani|2006b}}{{Sfn|BBC|2004}}{{Sfn|BBC Weather|A}} Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables, rivers.\n\n===Post-monsoon===\nDuring the post-monsoon or autumn months of October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or \"retreating\") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air masses to large parts of India. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=119}} Though the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth (\"post-monsoon\") season,{{Sfn|Parthasarathy|Munot|Kothawale|1994}}{{Sfn|India Meteorological Department|B}}{{Sfn|Library of Congress}} other sources designate only three seasons.{{Sfn|O'Hare|1997}} Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between {{Convert|28|and|34|C|F}}.\n\nThe northeast monsoon, which begins in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds that have already lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching [[Cape Comorin]] and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods.{{Sfn|Healy}} However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, [[Rainfall in Karnataka|Karnataka]] and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.\n\n==Statistics==\nShown below are temperature and precipitation data for selected Indian cities; these represent the full variety of major Indian climate types.

Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought on by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India{{Sfn|Balfour|2003|p=995}} and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.\n\n===Floods and landslides===\n{{See also|2007 South Asian floods|2008 Indian floods|2013 North Indian floods|2015 South Indian floods|2017  Indian floods|Brahmaputra floods}}\n[[File:Indian Navy relief efforts during the 2015 floods in Chennai (04).jpg|thumb|right|Relief efforts by the Indian Navy in Chennai]]\n\nIn the Lower Himalayas, landslides are common. The young age of the region's hills result in [[lability|labile]] rock formations, which are susceptible to slippages.  Short duration high intensity rainfall events typically trigger small scale landslides while long duration low intensity rainfall periods tend to trigger large scale catastrophic landslides.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dahal|first=Ranjan Kumar|last2=Hasegawa|first2=Shuichi|date=2008-08-15|title=Representative rainfall thresholds for landslides in the Nepal Himalaya|url=|journal=Geomorphology|volume=100|issue=3\u20134|pages=429\u2013443|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.01.014|bibcode=2008Geomo.100..429D}}</ref> Rising population and development pressures, particularly from logging and tourism, cause deforestation.

Avalanches occur in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nFloods are the most common natural disaster in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops.{{Sfn|Allaby|1997|pp=15, 42}} Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures.

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] is particularly common in the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean in and around the Bay of Bengal.

In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to [[famine in India|major Indian famines]]. These include the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876\u20131877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.{{Sfn|Nash|2002|pp=22\u201323}}{{Sfn|Collier|Webb|2002|p=67}}\n\nAll such episodes of severe drought correlate with [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events.{{Sfn|Kumar et al.|2006}}{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=121}} El Ni\u00f1o-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=259}} Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean\u2014in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to {{Convert|3|\u00b0C-change|\u00b0F-change|0}}\u2014have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s.{{Sfn|Nash|2002|pp=258\u2013259}} A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=117}} The extent that an ENSO event raises [[sea surface temperature]]s in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.{{Sfn|Kumar et al.|2006}}\n\n===Heat waves===\nA study from 2005 concluded that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial coverage in the decade 1991\u20132000, when compared to the period between 1971\u201380 and 1981\u201390.

Climate in south India is generally hotter than north India. Most part of the nation doesn't experience temperatures below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F) even in winter the temperature exceeds 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) during summer across the nation. Based on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen system]], [[India]] hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid deserts in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different [[microclimate]]s, making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (January and February), summer (March, April and May), [[monsoon]] (rainy) season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to December).\n\nIndia's [[geography of India|geography]] and [[geology of India|geology]] are climatically pivotal: the [[Thar Desert]] in the northwest and the [[Himalayas]] in the north work in tandem to create a [[Culture of India|culturally]] and [[Economy of India|economically]] important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid [[katabatic wind]]s from the icy [[Tibetan Plateau]] and northerly Central Asia. Most of [[North India]] is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.\n\nThough the [[Tropic of Cancer]]\u2014the boundary between the tropics and subtropics\u2014passes through the middle of India, the bulk of the country can be regarded as climatically tropical. As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather patterns in India can be wildly unstable: epochal droughts, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters are sporadic, but have displaced or ended millions of human lives. There is one scientific opinion which states that in South Asia such climatic events are likely [[effects of global warming on South Asia|to change in unpredictability, frequency, and severity]]. Ongoing and future vegetative changes and [[current sea level rise]]s and the attendant inundation of India's low-lying coastal areas are other impacts, current or predicted, that are attributable to [[global warming]].{{Sfn|Ravindranath|Bala|Sharma|2011}}\n<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Kalinagar Floods B.JPG|thumb|Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by [[monsoon]] in [[West Bengal]]]]\n[[File:Teestavalley.jpg|thumb|[[Indian highways|National Highway]] [[List of National Highways in India|31A]] winds along the banks of the [[Teesta River]] near [[Kalimpong]], in the [[Darjeeling]] Himalayan hill region in [[West Bengal]].]]\n[[File:India-view of shilla.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a chain of snow-capped mountains.

Despite its position within a high-latitude belt at 55\u201375\u00b0&nbsp;S\u2014latitudes now occupied by parts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35\u00b0&nbsp;N\u2014India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-deined seasons.{{Sfn|Chumakov|Zharkov|2003}} India later merged into the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], a process beginning some 550\u2013500&nbsp;Ma. During the Late [[Paleozoic]], Gondwana extended from a point at or near the [[South Pole]] to near the equator, where the [[Indian craton]] (stable [[continental crust]]) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-[[biomass]] [[ecosystems]]. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves\u2014much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence\u2014the fourth-largest reserves in the world.{{Sfn|CIA World Factbook}} During the [[Mesozoic]], the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today.

The nation's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert.{{Sfn|Chang|1967}} The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar [[latitude]]s.{{Sfn|Posey|1994|p=118}} Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.{{Sfn|Chang|1967}}{{Sfn|NCERT|p=28}} Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall seven climatic zones that, as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation.{{Sfn|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p=97}} Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system.\n\n===Tropical wet===\nA tropical rainy climate governs regions experiencing persistent warm or high temperatures, which normally do not fall below {{Convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. India hosts two climatic subtypes- [[tropical monsoon climate]], [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]]  that fall under this group.\n\n1) The most humid is the tropical wet climate\u2014also known as [[tropical monsoon climate]]\u2014that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the [[Malabar Coast]], the [[Western Ghats]], and southern Assam. India's two island territories, Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, are also subject to this climate. Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy\u2014typically above {{Convert|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year.{{Sfn|Chouhan|1992|p=7}} Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this moisture is enough to sustain lush forests and other vegetation for the rest of the mainly dry year. December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare. The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the exceptional biodiversity of tropical wet forests in parts of these regions.\n\n2) In India a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] is more common. Noticeably drier than areas with a tropical monsoon climate, it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi arid [[rain shadow]] east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long and dry periods with temperatures averaging above {{Convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Summer is exceedingly hot; temperatures in low-lying areas may exceed {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} during May, leading to heat waves that can each kill hundreds of Indians.{{Sfn|Farooq|2002}}The rainy season lasts from June to September; annual rainfall averages between {{Convert|750|\u2013|1500|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry.\n\nThe Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone: it receives between {{Convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall each year in the western part, and {{Convert|2000|to|3000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the eastern part. The coolest month of the year, on average, is January; April and May are the warmest months. Average temperatures in January range from {{Convert|14|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}, and average temperatures in April range from {{Convert|25|to|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}.

The region, which includes Karnataka, inland Tamil Nadu, western Andhra Pradesh, and central Maharashtra, gets between {{Convert|400|\u2013|750|mm|1}} annually. It is drought-prone, as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to sporadic lateness or failure of the southwest monsoon.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=124}} Karnataka is divided into three zones \u2013 coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about 3,638.5&nbsp;mm per annum, far in excess of the state average of 1,139&nbsp;mm (45&nbsp;in). In contrast to norm, Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India. North of the [[Krishna River]], the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall; to the south, significant post-monsoon rainfall also occurs in October and November. In December, the coldest month, temperatures still average around {{Convert|20|\u2013|24|C|F}}. The months between March to May are hot and dry; mean monthly temperatures hover around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, with {{Convert|320|mm|in|0}}precipitation. Hence, without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture.\n\n[[File:Thar Desert Sunset Rajasthan India.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=View of dunes at sunset. The setting sun hangs low and dim in a sky graded from fiery orange at top to maroon near the horizon. Terrestrial features are difficult to discern in the crepuscular illumination.|The [[Thar Desert]]]]\n\n2) Most of western Rajasthan experiences an '''arid climatic regime''' ([[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|Hot desert climate]]). [[Cloudburst]]s are responsible for virtually all of the region's annual precipitation, which totals less than {{Convert|300|mm|in|1}}. Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July, August, and September. Such rainfall is highly erratic; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so. Atmospheric moisture is largely prevented from precipitating due to continuous [[vertical draft|downdrafts]] and other factors.{{Sfn|Singhvi|Kar|2004}} The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around {{Convert|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, with daily maxima occasionally topping {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. During winters, temperatures in some areas can drop below freezing due to waves of cold air from Central Asia. There is a large diurnal range of about {{Convert|14|C-change|1}} during summer; this widens by several degrees during winter.\n[[File:Dust Strom in India.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dust storm in the [[Thar Desert]]]]\n\nTo the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate conditions prevail. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29&nbsp;\u00b0C (84&nbsp;\u00b0F) and nights around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (106&nbsp;\u00b0F) and nights no lower than 29&nbsp;\u00b0C (84&nbsp;\u00b0F). In the weeks before the monsoon temperatures are similar to the above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (81&nbsp;\u00b0F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.\n\n3) East of the Thar Desert, the Punjab-Haryana-Kathiawar region experiences a '''tropical and sub-tropical steppe climate'''. Haryana's climate resembles other states of the northern plains: extreme summer heat of up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter cold as low as 1&nbsp;\u00b0C. May and June are hottest; December and January are coldest. Rainfall is varied, with the Shivalik Hills region being the wettest and the Aravali Hills region being the driest. About 80% of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season of July\u2013September, which can cause flooding. The Punjabi climate is also governed by extremes of hot and cold. Areas near the Himalayan foothills receive heavy rainfall whereas those eloigned from them are hot and dry. Punjab's three-season climate sees summer months that span from mid-April to the end of June. Temperatures typically range from\u20132&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, but can reach 47&nbsp;\u00b0C (117&nbsp;\u00b0F) in summer and \u22124&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter. Most part of the nation doesn't experience temperatures below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F) even in winter. The zone, a transitional climatic region separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical savanna and forests, experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert. Average annual rainfall is {{Convert|300|\u2013|650|mm|in|1}}, but is very unreliable; as in much of the rest of India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation. Daily summer temperature maxima rise to around {{Convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}; this results in natural vegetation typically comprising short, coarse grasses.\n\n===Subtropical humid===\nMost of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Though they experience hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Due to ample monsoon rains, India has only one subtype of this climate under the [[Humid subtropical climate#South Asia|K\u00f6ppen system: ''Cwa''.]]{{Sfn|Kimmel|2000}} In most of this region, there is very little precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia.\n\nHumid subtropical regions are subject to pronounced dry winters. Winter rainfall\u2014and occasionally snowfall\u2014is associated with large storm systems such as \"Nor'westers\" and \"[[Western disturbances]]\"; the latter are steered by [[westerlies]] towards the Himalayas.{{Sfn|Das et al.|2002}} Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon; occasional [[tropical cyclones]] also contribute. Annual rainfall ranges from less than {{Convert|1000|mm|in|0}} in the west to over {{Convert|2500|mm|in|0}} in parts of the northeast. As most of this region is far from the ocean, the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a [[continental climate]] predominate; the swings are wider than in those in tropical wet regions, ranging from {{Convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in north-central India to {{Convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in the east.\n\n===Mountain===\n[[File:Pangong Tso lake.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a large body of water standing before a prominent peak, which communicates with several others partly out of view and behind.

In the Himalayas, the rate at which an air mass's temperature falls per kilometre (3,281&nbsp;ft) of altitude gained (the [[lapse rate|dry adiabatic lapse rate]]) is 9.8&nbsp;\u00b0C/km.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2005}} In terms of [[environmental lapse rate]], ambient temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{Convert|1000|m|ft|0}} rise in altitude. Thus, climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the [[snow line]] can coexist within several hundred metres of each other. Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes, high diurnal temperature variability, temperature inversions, and altitude-dependent variability in rainfall are also common.\n\nThe northern side of the western Himalayas, also known as the trans-Himalayan belt, has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. It is a region of barren, '''arid, frigid'''  and wind-blown wastelands. Areas south of the Himalayas are largely protected from cold winter winds coming in from the Asian interior. The leeward side (northern face) of the mountains receives less rain.\n\nThe southern slopes of the western Himalayas, well-exposed to the monsoon, get heavy rainfall.  Areas situated at elevations of 1,070\u20132,290 metres (3,510\u20137,510&nbsp;ft) receive the heaviest rainfall, which decreases rapidly at elevations above {{Convert|2290|m|ft|0}}. Most precipitation occurs as snowfall during the late winter and spring months.The Himalayas experience their heaviest snowfall between December and February and at elevations above {{Convert|1500|m|ft|0}}. Snowfall increases with elevation by up to several dozen millimetres per 100&nbsp;metre (~2&nbsp;in; 330&nbsp;ft) increase. Elevations above {{Convert|6000|m|ft|0}} never experience rain; all precipitation falls as snow.{{Sfn|Singh|Kumar|1997}}\n\n==Seasons==\n[[File:Fort Bandhavgarh National Park Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view of a small marshy lake surrounded by dry brush in winter.

The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around {{Convert|10|\u2013|15|C|F}} in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around {{Convert|20|\u2013|25|C|F}} in mainland India's southeast.\n* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to May. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\nThe Himalayan states, being more temperate, experience an additional season, ''spring'', which coincides with the first weeks of summer in southern India. Traditionally, North Indians note six seasons or ''Ritu'', each about two months long. These are the spring season (''{{Lang-sa|vasanta}}''), summer (''gr\u012b\u1e63ma''), monsoon season (''var\u1e63\u0101''), autumn (''\u015barada''), winter (''hemanta''), and prevernal season<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> (''\u015bi\u015bira''). These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts. The ancient [[Hindu calendar]] also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.\n\n=== Winter ===\n[[File:Gulmarg.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view looking down from a snowy ridge onto a mountain valley far below, lost in mist.

As the Sun's vertical rays move south of the equator, most of the country experiences moderately cool weather. December and January are the coldest months, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the Indian Himalayas. Temperatures are higher in the east and south.\n\nIn northwestern India region, virtually cloudless conditions prevail in October and November, resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings; as in much of the Deccan Plateau, they register at 16\u201320&nbsp;\u00b0C (61\u201368&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, from January to February, \"western disturbances\" bring heavy bursts of rain and snow. These extra-tropical [[low pressure area|low-pressure systems]] originate in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.{{Sfn|Hatwar|Yadav|Rama Rao|2005}} They are carried towards India by the subtropical [[westerlies]], which are the prevailing winds blowing at North India's range of latitude.{{Sfn|Das et al.|2002}} Once their passage is hindered by the Himalayas, they are unable to proceed further, and they release significant precipitation over the southern Himalayas.\n\nThere is a huge variation in the climatic conditions of Himachal Pradesh due to variation in altitude (450\u20136500 metres). The climate varies from hot and subtropical humid (450\u2013900 meters) in the southern low tracts, warm and temperate (900\u20131800 metres), cool and temperate (1900\u20132400 metres) and cold glacial and alpine (2400\u20134800 meters) in the northern and eastern elevated mountain ranges. By October, nights and mornings are very cold. Snowfall at elevations of nearly 3000 m is about 3 m and lasts from December start to March end. Elevations above 4500 m support perpetual snow. The spring season starts from mid February to mid April. The weather is pleasant and comfortable in the season. The rainy season starts at the end of the month of June. The landscape lushes green and fresh. During the season streams and natural springs are replenished. The heavy rains in July and August cause a lot of damage resulting in erosion, floods and landslides. Out of all the state districts, Dharamsala receives the highest rainfall, nearly about {{Convert|3400|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Spiti is the driest area of the state, where annual rainfall is below 50&nbsp;mm.{{Sfn|Hara|Kimura|Yasunari}} The five Himalayan states (Jammu and Kashmir in the extreme north, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh) and Northern West Bengal experience heavy snowfall, Manipur and Nagaland are not located in the Himalayas but experience occasional snowfall; in Jammu and Kashmir, [[blizzard]]s occur regularly, disrupting travel and other activities.\n\nThe rest of North India, including the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] almost never receives snow. Temperatures in the plains occasionally fall below freezing, though never for more than one or two days. Winter highs in Delhi range from {{Convert|16|to|21|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. Nighttime temperatures average {{Convert|2|\u2013|8|C|F}}.

In Bihar in middle of the Ganges plain, hot weather sets in and the summer lasts until the middle of June. The highest temperature is often registered in May which is the hottest time. Like the rest of the north, Bihar also experiences dust-storms, thunderstorms and dust raising winds during the hot season. Dust storms having a velocity of {{Convert|48|\u2013|64|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} are most frequent in May and with second maximum in April and June.

It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from travelling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region instead. The Himalayas are indeed believed to play an important role in the formation of Central Asian deserts such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]]. The mountain ranges prevent western winter disturbances in Iran from travelling further east, resulting in much snow in Kashmir and rainfall for parts of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and northern India. Despite the Himalayas being a barrier to the cold northerly winter winds, the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds, thus lowering the temperature in Northeast India and Bangladesh. The Himalayas, which are often called \"The Roof of the World\", contain the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles. Ten of Asia's largest rivers flow from there. The two Himalayan states in the east, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, receive substantial snowfall. The extreme north of [[West Bengal]] centred on [[Darjeeling]] experiences snowfall, but only rarely.\n\nIn [[South India]], particularly the hinterlands of Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, somewhat cooler weather prevails. Minimum temperatures in western Maharashtra and [[Chhattisgarh]] hover around {{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}; in the southern Deccan Plateau, they reach {{Convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Coastal areas\u2014especially those near the [[Coromandel Coast]] and adjacent low-elevation interior tracts\u2014are warm, with daily high temperatures of {{Convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} and lows of around {{Convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. The Western Ghats, including the [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Nilgiri Range]], are exceptional; lows there can fall below freezing.{{Sfn|Blasco|Bellan|Aizpuru|1996}} This compares with a range of {{Convert|12|\u2013|14|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} on the Malabar Coast; there, as is the case for other coastal areas, the Indian Ocean exerts a strong moderating influence on weather.{{Sfn|Posey|1994|p=118}} The region averages {{Convert|800|mm|in}}\n\n===Summer===\n[[File:Khajjiar.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime sunlit view of a verdant bowl-shaped meadow with a small pond in a valley rimmed by several prominent hills covered in evergreen forest.

The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer. The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April; for most of North India, it is May. Temperatures of {{Convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season. Another striking feature of summer is the [[Loo (wind)]]. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds that blow during the day in  India. Direct exposure to these winds may be fatal.{{Sfn|Farooq|2002}} In cooler regions of North India, immense pre-monsoon [[squall]]-line thunderstorms, known locally as \"Nor'westers\", commonly drop large hailstones. In Himachal Pradesh, Summer lasts from mid April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in [[Alpine climate|alpine]] zone which experience mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from {{Convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} to {{Convert|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Winter lasts from late November till mid March. Snowfall is generally common in alpine tracts that are above {{Convert|2200|m|ft|0}}, especially those in the higher- and trans-Himalayan regions.{{Sfn|Changnon|1971}} Near the coast, the temperature hovers around {{Convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, and the proximity of the sea increases the level of humidity. In southern India, the temperatures are higher on the east coast by a few degrees compared to the west coast.\n\nBy May, most of the Indian interior experiences mean temperatures over {{Convert|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, while maximum temperatures often exceed {{Convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. In the hot months of April and May, western disturbances, with their cooling influence, may still arrive, but rapidly diminish in frequency as summer progresses.{{Sfn|Pisharoty|Desai|1956}} Notably, a higher frequency of such disturbances in April correlates with a delayed monsoon onset (thus extending summer) in northwest India. In eastern India, monsoon onset dates have been steadily advancing over the past several decades, resulting in shorter summers there.{{Sfn|Das et al.|2002}}\n\nAltitude affects the temperature to a large extent, with higher parts of the [[Deccan Plateau]] and other areas being relatively cooler. [[Hill station]]s, such as [[Ootacamund]] (\"Ooty\") in the Western Ghats and [[Kalimpong]] in the eastern Himalayas, with average maximum temperatures of around {{Convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, offer some respite from the heat. At lower elevations, in parts of northern and western India, a strong, hot, and dry wind known as the [[Loo (wind)|loo]] blows in from the west during the daytime; with very high temperatures, in some cases up to around {{Convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}; it can cause fatal cases of [[Hyperthermia|sunstroke]]. [[Tornado]]es may also occur, concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan.

Fishing in the coastal areas is not possible now due to the harsh weather conditions.]]\nThe southwest summer monsoon, a four-month period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India's weather, is Earth's most productive wet season.{{Sfn|Collier|Webb|2002|p=91}} A product of southeast [[trade wind]]s originating from a high-pressure mass centred over the southern Indian Ocean, the monsoonal torrents supply over 80% of India's annual rainfall.{{Sfn|Bagla|2006}} Attracted by a low-pressure region centred over South Asia, the mass spawns surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=118}} These inflows ultimately result from a northward shift of the local jet stream, which itself results from rising summer temperatures over [[Tibet]] and the Indian subcontinent. The void left by the jet stream, which switches from a route just south of the Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Burns et al.|2003}} This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}} This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]'s [[orogeny|uplift]], which accompanied the [[Eocene]]\u2013[[Oligocene]] transition event, a major episode of global cooling and [[aridification]] which occurred 34\u201349&nbsp;Ma.{{Sfn|Dupont-Nivet et al.|2007}}\n\nThe southwest monsoon arrives in two branches: the [[Bay of Bengal]] branch and the [[Arabian Sea]] branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the [[Malabar Coast]] of Kerala.{{Sfn|India Meteorological Department|A}} By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from [[Cape Comorin]] to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By the first week of July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.{{Sfn|Burroughs|1999|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Daytime view over a city: de-laminating concrete housing blocks surrounded by rough slum tenements.

Weak or failed monsoons (droughts) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth.{{Sfn|Vaswani|2006b}}{{Sfn|BBC|2004}}{{Sfn|BBC Weather|A}} Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables, rivers.\n\n===Post-monsoon===\nDuring the post-monsoon or autumn months of October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or \"retreating\") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air masses to large parts of India. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=119}} Though the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth (\"post-monsoon\") season,{{Sfn|Parthasarathy|Munot|Kothawale|1994}}{{Sfn|India Meteorological Department|B}}{{Sfn|Library of Congress}} other sources designate only three seasons.{{Sfn|O'Hare|1997}} Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between {{Convert|28|and|34|C|F}}.\n\nThe northeast monsoon, which begins in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds that have already lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching [[Cape Comorin]] and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods.{{Sfn|Healy}} However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, [[Rainfall in Karnataka|Karnataka]] and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.\n\n==Statistics==\nShown below are temperature and precipitation data for selected Indian cities; these represent the full variety of major Indian climate types.

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] is particularly common in the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean in and around the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones bring with them heavy rains, [[storm surge]]s, and winds that often cut affected areas off from relief and supplies. In the North Indian Ocean Basin, the cyclone season runs from April to December, with peak activity between May and November.{{Sfn|AOML FAQ G1}} Each year, an average of eight storms with sustained wind speeds greater than {{Convert|63|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} form; of these, two strengthen into true tropical cyclones, which sustain gusts greater than {{Convert|117|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. On average, a major ([[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] or higher) cyclone develops every other year.{{Sfn|AOML FAQ G1}}{{Sfn|AOML FAQ E10}}\n\nDuring summer, the [[Bay of Bengal]] is subject to intense heating, giving rise to humid and unstable air masses that morph into cyclones.

Widespread death and property destruction are reported every year in the exposed coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.\n\n[[Cyclone 05B (1999)|Cyclone 05B]], a supercyclone that struck Orissa on 29 October 1999, was the deadliest in more than a quarter-century.

In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to [[famine in India|major Indian famines]]. These include the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876\u20131877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.{{Sfn|Nash|2002|pp=22\u201323}}{{Sfn|Collier|Webb|2002|p=67}}\n\nAll such episodes of severe drought correlate with [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events.{{Sfn|Kumar et al.|2006}}{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=121}} El Ni\u00f1o-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=259}} Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean\u2014in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to {{Convert|3|\u00b0C-change|\u00b0F-change|0}}\u2014have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s.{{Sfn|Nash|2002|pp=258\u2013259}} A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts.{{Sfn|Caviedes|2001|p=117}} The extent that an ENSO event raises [[sea surface temperature]]s in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.{{Sfn|Kumar et al.|2006}}\n\n===Heat waves===\nA study from 2005 concluded that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial coverage in the decade 1991\u20132000, when compared to the period between 1971\u201380 and 1981\u201390.

James Walsh, the owner of Darwen FC and the associated mill decides to secretly pay two Scottish players, [[Fergus Suter|Fergus \"Fergie\" Suter]] and James \"Jimmy\" Love to join his team in a bid to secure the FA Cup (which at the time is exclusively for amateurs). At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recovers with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all. The Old Etonians, who also happen to be FA Board members, decide that since [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] was not previously agreed to then the Quarterfinal will be replayed instead. The mill has financial issues and townsfolk pitch in to help pay for the trip. The replay is handily won by Old Etonians who focus more on shutting down Suter and Love rather than playing their own game.

Stokes, a team member, goes to Kinnaird\u2019s bank to ask for a loan. Some Darwen mill workers talk about strike as a result of a prior 5% wage cut. The Cotton Guild imposes another 10% wage cut. Darwen workers walk out. The team refuses to train or play in matches while on strike. Suter fails to convince Walsh to go against the guild. Workers go to the guild to demand a 5 per cent wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Col. Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him. Police show up and arrest Stokes and kill his dog. Stokes is put on trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kinnaird testifies on behalf of Stokes and saves him from prison and gives him his loan. Walsh agrees to the 5 per cent wage cut and to work five days a week if the team plays their upcoming match. While waiting on the team at the match, Suter is approached by the manager of Blackburn FC and is offered \u00a3100 upfront and a \u00a36 weekly wage increase.

After practice with the Etonians, teammates talk about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of working class teams joining the Football Association. While the gentleman scoff at the conditions of the working poor, Kinnaird comes to their defence. The Darwen team are out celebrating Jimmy\u2019s [[stag party]]. Mr. Walsh tells Suter that he\u2019s proud of his decision to bring Suter on to the team. Suter thanks him but doesn\u2019t mention the deal with Blackburn.

He shows off new teammates, including Jack Hunter from Sheffield, and tells Suter he is assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr. Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses, saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates. Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy that he is trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he is joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game. The FA President complains that if it continues, only the richest teams will win and is planning to watch the exhibition match between Darwen and Blackburn to find evidence to expel them from the FA cup. The match between Darwen and Blackburn is rough and Jimmy\u2019s leg is badly broken by a tackle and the blood loss threatens both his life and his leg. |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Fywell\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Geoff Bussetil\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jimmy is told he\u2019ll never play football again. Cartwright tells the Blackburn team that a portion of the match proceeds will go to help Jimmy\u2019s recovery. Cartwright asks Suter how Martha and her daughter are doing after her job loss.

Darwen teammates start to reconcile with Suter. Stokes talks about his business success making football kits. Doris asks after a job for Jimmy. Kinnaird has a falling out with his friend over the true reason behind missing the quarter-final match.

Kinnaird debates the merits of paying players with the Etonians. The Lancashire teams band together to beat the elite teams. Mr. Walsh persuades Tommy to join Blackburn to replace Jimmy. Cartwright offers Suter the captainship (and a bonus) if they make it to the final. Mrs. Cartwright offers Martha a job at Brockshall and says she can bring Jenie.

Mr. Walsh tells him the Lancashire FA and most other county FA\u2019s will withdraw from the FA cup and form a new association. Kinnaird would be the new president. Kinnaird argues the working class teams will overwhelm the elite teams unless they include the working class. Kinnaird convinces the Board to let Blackburn play. At the match, the 1883 FA Club Final, the Etonians are playing well but very physical. Score is 0-0 at halftime. One of the Etonian players is injured but they agree to keep playing anyway.

At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recovers with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all.

The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!

The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!
