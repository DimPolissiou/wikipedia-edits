It is a slower tempo, [[rhythm and blues]]-inspired ballad featuring Hendrix's vocal and guitar with recording studio effects accompanied by bass, drums, and [[glockenspiel]]. Lyrically, it is one of several of his songs that reference an idealized feminine or [[guardian angel]]-like figure. At about two and a half minutes in length, it is one of his most concise and melodically-focused pieces.\n\nThe origins of \"Little Wing\" have been traced back to the 1966 recording of \"(My Girl) She's a Fox\", an R&B song which features Hendrix playing [[Curtis Mayfield]]-influenced guitar accompaniment. He developed the song while performing in New York City's Greenwich Village prior to his involvement with producer [[Chas Chandler]]. After being inspired by events at the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], Hendrix completed the song in October 1967, when it was recorded by the Experience during the sessions for their second album ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]''.\n\n\"Little Wing\" was released with the ''Axis'' album in December 1967 in the UK and the following month in the US. As one of only two songs from the album to become part of the Experience's concert repertoire, the Experience often performed it live and recordings were issued on early Hendrix posthumous albums ''[[Hendrix in the West]]'' in 1972 and ''[[The Jimi Hendrix Concerts]]'' in 1982. More recently, demo versions have been released as well as additional live renditions.  \"Little Wing\" is one of Hendrix's most popular songs and has become a standard, with interpretations recorded by musicians in a variety of styles. It is ranked number 366 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n==Background==\nJimi Hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular R&B artists, including [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Don Covay]], and [[Little Richard]]. He learned from other R&B guitarists, including [[Curtis Mayfield]], who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=68}}{{efn|Other R&B guitar influences include in-demand session guitarist [[Cornell Dupree]], with whom Hendrix shared guitar duties while touring with [[King Curtis]] in 1966{{sfn|Black|1999|p=39}} and [[Steve Cropper]] with [[Stax Records]]/[[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]].{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=63}}}}  Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963.  He described the experience: \"The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and [[the Impressions]].  Curtis was a ''really'' good guitarist&nbsp;... I learned a lot in that short time.  He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know\".{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=61}}  In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled \"(My Girl) She's a Fox\" with the Icemen, an R&B duo.{{efn|\"(My Girl) She's a Fox\" was written by brothers Richard and Robert Poindexter, who later wrote \"[[Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]\".{{sfn|McDermott|2010|p=11}}}} Hendrix biographer [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] has described it as \"paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [that] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=77}}  Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to \"She's a Fox\" (included on the 2010 ''[[West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology]]'') \"perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career.  Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nAccording to Hendrix, \"Little Wing\" came from an idea he had originally developed while playing in [[Greenwich Village]], when he was fronting his band [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] in the summer of 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=42}}  He later explained that he was further inspired during the Experience's performance at the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]:{{efn|Underground chemist [[Owsley Stanley]], who perfected the mass production of [[LSD]] before it was made illegal, was present \"freely handing out LSD to musicians backstage\".  Hendrix was surprised to learn that the purple tabs had been nicknamed \"purple haze\" by some after his song. {{sfn|Cross|2005|p=191}}}}\n{{quote|I got the idea like, when we were in Monterey and I was just looking at everything around. So I figured that I take everything I see around and put it maybe in the form of a girl maybe, somethin' like that, you know, and call it 'Little Wing', and then it will just fly away. Everybody's really flyin' and they're really in a nice mood, like the police and everybody was really, really great out there. So I just took all these things an put them in one very, very small little matchbox, you know, into a girl and then do it. It was very simple, but I like it though.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\n[[File:Jimi Hendrix experience 1968.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jimi Hendrix Experience promotional photo circa 1968]]\nIn October 1967, recording sessions for the second [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience|Experience]] album, ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'', began at [[Olympic Studios]] in London.  On October 25, after recording the strongly R&B-oriented \"[[Wait Until Tomorrow]]\", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of \"Little Wing\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=71}}  It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel.{{sfn|McDermott|2000|p=28}}{{efn|On October 14 or 15, 1967, Hendrix and drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] recorded an early instrumental demo which was apparently labeled \"Little Wing\" on the tape box, although Shadwick claims that it was a mistake, because of its much closer resemblance to Hendrix's later song \"[[Angel (Jimi Hendrix song)|Angel]]\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=127}}}} After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach.  Recording engineer [[Eddie Kramer]] explained, \"Chas knew right away what was needed.  He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again\".{{sfn|McDermott|2000|p=28}}  After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}}  For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=72}}  For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a \"hollow\" tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"out-of-phase\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=247}}  However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift [[Leslie speaker]], which was normally used for electric organs.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}} By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce [[vibrato]]- and [[tremolo]]-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized the use of the [[Univibe]] [[Phaser (effect)|phase shifter]] [[Effects unit|effects pedal]], which can be set to get a roughly similar effect).{{sfn|Rubin|Whitehill|1992|p=22}}  Next, Hendrix added a straight (\"dry, without any effects\") [[glockenspiel]] to underscore his vocal and guitar.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=95}}  According to Kramer, \"Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio\" and found the glockenspiel in Studio A.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}}  Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound.  These have been variously described as [[artificial double tracking]] (ADT), [[Phasing (music)|phasing]], Pultec filter [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], and processing with a Leslie speaker.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=95}}{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=531}}\n\nRegarding the song's arrangement, Shapiro commented, \"Musically, 'Little Wing' is structured to lay a gossamer touch across the whole song from the arresting opening statement and the haunting glockenspiel to the use of a Leslie speaker cabinet for the guitar\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}  According to [[AllMusic]]'s Matthew Greenwald, it is based on a \"gentle, soulful chord progression [which] guides the melody and is an accurate mirror of the title and lyrics\".<ref name=\"Greenwald\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/little-wing-mt0004402125\n| title = Jimi Hendrix: Little Wing \u2013 Song Review\n| last = Greenwald\n| first = Matthew\n| website = [[AllMusic]]\n| accessdate = March 25, 2014\n}}</ref>  The song has been notated in [[4/4 time|4/4]] time with one bar in 2/4 at a slow rock (70\u201372 [[beats per minute]]) tempo and is built on a [[chord progression]] without a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] section:{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|pp=133\u2013142}}{{efn|As with most Hendrix songs, his guitar is tuned down one-half step, resulting in a lower pitch. {{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:650px;\"\n|-\n|width=11%|Em\n|width=11%|G\n|width=11%|Am\n|width=11%|Em\n|width=11%|Bm\u2013B{{music|flat}}\n|width=11%|Am\u2013C\n|width=11%|G\u2013F<sup>add9</sup>\n|width=11%|{{music|time|2|4}} C\n|width=11%|{{music|time|4|4}} D\n|width=11%|rest\n|}\nAfter an instrumental introduction, there are two verses, followed by a guitar solo, which has been described as \"richly melodic\" by biographer Keith Shadwick.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}  Shapiro noted the song's brevity: \"The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer \u2013 he said what he wanted to say and stopped\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\nHendrix's use of guitar chords for the song involves unconventional finger positions and approach to the fretboard.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}  Guitarist [[Frank Marino]] explained:\n{{quote|He had the tendency to play with his fingers very flat [on the guitar's fretboard], and he had a very long thumb, so he could come over the top of the neck to play bass notes.  That left his fingers in a likely position to do all this chordal-type stuff.  Playing with his fingers so flat also got him that double-string effect every time, like in '[[Castles Made of Sand (song)|Castles Made of Sand]]' or 'Little Wing\".  That's an R&B thing.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}}}\nA reference work by [[Hal Leonard Corporation|Hal Leonard]] compares it to a pianist's approach, with Hendrix's \"thumb fret[ting] the bass notes, functioning in almost the same manner as a keyboardist's left hand, and the fingers of his fretting hand can be likened to a pianist's right hand\".{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}  Leonard also adds that guitarist [[Adrian Belew]] describes the technique as a \"lost art\".{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}\n\n==Lyrics and interpretation==\nIn discussing his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic.  In a 1967 interview, he explained \"Most ballads come across in different ways.  Sometimes you see things in different ways than other people see it.  So then you write it in a song.  It could represent anything\".{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=142}}  In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs \"[[I Don't Live Today]]\", \"[[May This Be Love]]\", and \"Little Wing\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=191}}  He described \"Little Wing\" as being \"based on a very, very simple Indian style\",{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}} perhaps referring to some [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|Native American mythologies]] in which [[spirit]]s inhabit nature and animals, including birds.  In one interview, he saw it as self-explanatory: \"That's exactly what it's about, like 'She's walking through the clouds'\",{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=191}}\n{{poemquote|With a circus mind that's running wild\nButterflies and zebras, and moonbeams and fairy tales\nThat's all she ever thinks about, riding with the wind{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|pp=135\u2013136}}}}\nMusic journalist [[Charles Shaar Murray]] likens the figure to a feminine ideal: \"Sometimes she is a spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is\".{{sfn|Murray|1991|p=74}}  The figure first appears as \"Waterfall\" in \"May This Be Love\", where she offers solace and hope, and as \"a soulful, loving [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]]\" in \"Little Wing\".{{sfn|Murray|1991|p=74}}  However, other writers have suggested that the figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity,{{sfn|Henderson|1981|p=175}} which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song \"[[Angel (Jimi Hendrix song)|Angel]]\".{{efn|\"[[Angel (Jimi Hendrix song)|Angel]]\" was issued as a single and on the album ''[[Cry of Love]]'' six months after his death. {{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=540}}}} Hendrix's brother, [[Leon Hendrix|Leon]], interpreted \"Little Wing\" (and \"Angel\") as a general tribute: \"He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife\".{{sfn|Hendrix|Mitchell|2012|pp=219\u2013220}}{{efn|Biographer [[Charles R.

I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden.\"{{sfn|Fairchild|1991|p=6}}  In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: \"So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes&nbsp;...

And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm off here and there and off over there.\"{{sfn|Hall|Clark|1970|p=134}}\n\n==Releases==\n[[File:Axiscover.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Axis: Bold as Love'' album cover (front)]]\n\"Little Wing\", along with the rest of the tracks for ''Axis: Bold as Love'', was mixed October 31, 1967.  Because some of the masters had been lost, stereo remixes were prepared on November 1 (it is not clear if \"Little Wing\" was among those remixed).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=76}}  On November 2, 1967, a monaural mix was prepared, making ''Axis'' the last Hendrix album specifically mixed in mono (subsequent mono albums were electronically \"folded\" from the stereo mixes).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=76}}  When recording engineer Kramer was preparing the album for a new mono reissue, he commented on the differences: \"Perhaps the most unique track was 'Little Wing'.

It is a slower tempo, [[rhythm and blues]]-inspired ballad featuring Hendrix's vocal and guitar with recording studio effects accompanied by bass, drums, and [[glockenspiel]]. Lyrically, it is one of several of his songs that reference an idealized feminine or [[guardian angel]]-like figure. At about two and a half minutes in length, it is one of his most concise and melodically-focused pieces.\n\nThe origins of \"Little Wing\" have been traced back to the 1966 recording of \"(My Girl) She's a Fox\", an R&B song which features Hendrix playing [[Curtis Mayfield]]-influenced guitar accompaniment. He developed the song while performing in New York City's Greenwich Village prior to his involvement with producer [[Chas Chandler]]. After being inspired by events at the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], Hendrix completed the song in October 1967, when it was recorded by the Experience during the sessions for their second album ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]''.\n\n\"Little Wing\" was released with the ''Axis'' album in December 1967 in the UK and the following month in the US. As one of only two songs from the album to become part of the Experience's concert repertoire, the Experience often performed it live and recordings were issued on early Hendrix posthumous albums ''[[Hendrix in the West]]'' in 1972 and ''[[The Jimi Hendrix Concerts]]'' in 1982. More recently, demo versions have been released as well as additional live renditions.  \"Little Wing\" is one of Hendrix's most popular songs and has become a standard, with interpretations recorded by musicians in a variety of styles. It is ranked number 366 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n==Background==\nJimi Hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular R&B artists, including [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Don Covay]], and [[Little Richard]]. He learned from other R&B guitarists, including [[Curtis Mayfield]], who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=68}}{{efn|Other R&B guitar influences include in-demand session guitarist [[Cornell Dupree]], with whom Hendrix shared guitar duties while touring with [[King Curtis]] in 1966{{sfn|Black|1999|p=39}} and [[Steve Cropper]] with [[Stax Records]]/[[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]].{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=63}}}}  Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963.  He described the experience: \"The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and [[the Impressions]].  Curtis was a ''really'' good guitarist&nbsp;... I learned a lot in that short time.  He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know\".{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=61}}  In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled \"(My Girl) She's a Fox\" with the Icemen, an R&B duo.{{efn|\"(My Girl) She's a Fox\" was written by brothers Richard and Robert Poindexter, who later wrote \"[[Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]\".{{sfn|McDermott|2010|p=11}}}} Hendrix biographer [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] has described it as \"paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [that] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=77}}  Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to \"She's a Fox\" (included on the 2010 ''[[West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology]]'') \"perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career.  Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nAccording to Hendrix, \"Little Wing\" came from an idea he had originally developed while playing in [[Greenwich Village]], when he was fronting his band [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] in the summer of 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=42}}  He later explained that he was further inspired during the Experience's performance at the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]:{{efn|Underground chemist [[Owsley Stanley]], who perfected the mass production of [[LSD]] before it was made illegal, was present \"freely handing out LSD to musicians backstage\".  Hendrix was surprised to learn that the purple tabs had been nicknamed \"purple haze\" by some after his song. {{sfn|Cross|2005|p=191}}}}\n{{quote|I got the idea like, when we were in Monterey and I was just looking at everything around. So I figured that I take everything I see around and put it maybe in the form of a girl maybe, somethin' like that, you know, and call it 'Little Wing', and then it will just fly away. Everybody's really flyin' and they're really in a nice mood, like the police and everybody was really, really great out there. So I just took all these things an put them in one very, very small little matchbox, you know, into a girl and then do it. It was very simple, but I like it though.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\n[[File:Jimi Hendrix experience 1968.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jimi Hendrix Experience promotional photo circa 1968]]\nIn October 1967, recording sessions for the second [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience|Experience]] album, ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'', began at [[Olympic Studios]] in London.  On October 25, after recording the strongly R&B-oriented \"[[Wait Until Tomorrow]]\", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of \"Little Wing\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=71}}  It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel.{{sfn|McDermott|2000|p=28}}{{efn|On October 14 or 15, 1967, Hendrix and drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] recorded an early instrumental demo which was apparently labeled \"Little Wing\" on the tape box, although Shadwick claims that it was a mistake, because of its much closer resemblance to Hendrix's later song \"[[Angel (Jimi Hendrix song)|Angel]]\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=127}}}} After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach.  Recording engineer [[Eddie Kramer]] explained, \"Chas knew right away what was needed.  He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again\".{{sfn|McDermott|2000|p=28}}  After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}}  For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=72}}  For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a \"hollow\" tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"out-of-phase\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=247}}  However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift [[Leslie speaker]], which was normally used for electric organs.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}} By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce [[vibrato]]- and [[tremolo]]-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized the use of the [[Univibe]] [[Phaser (effect)|phase shifter]] [[Effects unit|effects pedal]], which can be set to get a roughly similar effect).{{sfn|Rubin|Whitehill|1992|p=22}}  Next, Hendrix added a straight (\"dry, without any effects\") [[glockenspiel]] to underscore his vocal and guitar.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=95}}  According to Kramer, \"Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio\" and found the glockenspiel in Studio A.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=74}}  Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound.  These have been variously described as [[artificial double tracking]] (ADT), [[Phasing (music)|phasing]], Pultec filter [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], and processing with a Leslie speaker.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=95}}{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=531}}\n\nRegarding the song's arrangement, Shapiro commented, \"Musically, 'Little Wing' is structured to lay a gossamer touch across the whole song from the arresting opening statement and the haunting glockenspiel to the use of a Leslie speaker cabinet for the guitar\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}  According to [[AllMusic]]'s Matthew Greenwald, it is based on a \"gentle, soulful chord progression [which] guides the melody and is an accurate mirror of the title and lyrics\".<ref name=\"Greenwald\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/little-wing-mt0004402125\n| title = Jimi Hendrix: Little Wing \u2013 Song Review\n| last = Greenwald\n| first = Matthew\n| website = [[AllMusic]]\n| accessdate = March 25, 2014\n}}</ref>  The song has been notated in [[4/4 time|4/4]] time with one bar in 2/4 at a slow rock (70\u201372 [[beats per minute]]) tempo and is built on a [[chord progression]] without a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] section:{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|pp=133\u2013142}}{{efn|As with most Hendrix songs, his guitar is tuned down one-half step, resulting in a lower pitch. {{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:650px;\"\n|-\n|width=11%|Em\n|width=11%|G\n|width=11%|Am\n|width=11%|Em\n|width=11%|Bm\u2013B{{music|flat}}\n|width=11%|Am\u2013C\n|width=11%|G\u2013F<sup>add9</sup>\n|width=11%|{{music|time|2|4}} C\n|width=11%|{{music|time|4|4}} D\n|width=11%|rest\n|}\nAfter an instrumental introduction, there are two verses, followed by a guitar solo, which has been described as \"richly melodic\" by biographer Keith Shadwick.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}  Shapiro noted the song's brevity: \"The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer \u2013 he said what he wanted to say and stopped\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\nHendrix's use of guitar chords for the song involves unconventional finger positions and approach to the fretboard.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}  Guitarist [[Frank Marino]] explained:\n{{quote|He had the tendency to play with his fingers very flat [on the guitar's fretboard], and he had a very long thumb, so he could come over the top of the neck to play bass notes.  That left his fingers in a likely position to do all this chordal-type stuff.  Playing with his fingers so flat also got him that double-string effect every time, like in '[[Castles Made of Sand (song)|Castles Made of Sand]]' or 'Little Wing\".  That's an R&B thing.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=128}}}}\nA reference work by [[Hal Leonard Corporation|Hal Leonard]] compares it to a pianist's approach, with Hendrix's \"thumb fret[ting] the bass notes, functioning in almost the same manner as a keyboardist's left hand, and the fingers of his fretting hand can be likened to a pianist's right hand\".{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}  Leonard also adds that guitarist [[Adrian Belew]] describes the technique as a \"lost art\".{{sfn|Experience Hendrix|1998|p=133}}\n\n==Lyrics and interpretation==\nIn discussing his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic.  In a 1967 interview, he explained \"Most ballads come across in different ways.  Sometimes you see things in different ways than other people see it.  So then you write it in a song.  It could represent anything\".{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=142}}  In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs \"[[I Don't Live Today]]\", \"[[May This Be Love]]\", and \"Little Wing\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=191}}  He described \"Little Wing\" as being \"based on a very, very simple Indian style\",{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=224\u2013225}} perhaps referring to some [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|Native American mythologies]] in which [[spirit]]s inhabit nature and animals, including birds.

I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden.\"{{sfn|Fairchild|1991|p=6}}  In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: \"So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes&nbsp;...

M. Barrie]]. The earliest were the stage productions of the play, and an adaptation to [[silent film]], done with Barrie's involvement and personal approval. Later works were authorised by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], to which Barrie gave the rights to the Peter Pan works; these include adaptations of the main story in both [[animation|animated]] and [[live-action film]]s, [[musicals|musical stage productions]], and a [[sequel]] [[novel]]. In addition, there have been numerous uses of Barrie's characters, settings, and storylines which challenged or took advantage of the changing [[copyright]] status of these elements, including reinterpretations, sequels, [[prequel]]s, and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s in a variety of media, including film, television series, and books.\n\nAdaptations of ''Peter Pan'' for public performance have a unique status in UK copyright law: [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] has the right to receive [[royalties]] in perpetuity under specific provisions in the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988#Peter Pan|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]].\n\nWhen dramatized, the character of Peter has usually\u2014but not always\u2014been played by an adult woman. For boys' roles to be played by women is a convention of the [[pantomime]] tradition that was popular when the play was first produced, and was necessitated by laws restricting the use of child actors for evening performances. Later adaptations have often followed this example, for reasons that include tradition, the performance demands of the role, and the marketing advantages of \"star\" actresses. The roles of [[Captain Hook]] and [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|George Darling]] happened to be played by the same actor in the original production, a tradition which has sometimes been continued in later dramatic adaptations.\n\n==Books and publications==\n\n===Original works===\n* 1904 \u2013 ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' (play): Peter brings Wendy and her brothers to Neverland, where he has a showdown with his nemesis, Captain Hook. This play was adapted as a novel by Barrie. Variations and adaptations have been produced in various media.\n* 1906 \u2013 ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'': an origin story where the infant Peter flies away from his home, takes up residence in Kensington Gardens and makes friends with the fairies. It is a \"book-within-a-book\" that was first published in Barrie's The Little White Bird in 1902.\n* 1908 \u2013 ''When Wendy Grew Up \u2013 An Afterthought'', a short sequel play first staged in 1908, but only published in book form in 1957.\n* 1911 \u2013 ''Peter and Wendy'' (novel), later published as ''Peter Pan and Wendy'', adapted as a novel from the play, it also incorporates events from ''When Wendy Grew Up \u2013 An Afterthought''.\n\n===Literary \u2013 Fiction===\n*'''''The Peter Pan Picture Book''''' (sometimes entitled ''The Story of Peter Pan''), retold by Daniel O'Connor, illustrated by [[Alice B. Woodward]] (1907),<ref>O'Connor, Daniel, illustrated by Alice B Woodward. ''The Peter Pan Picture Book''. G. Bell & Sons (1907)</ref> based on the original stage production of 1904. The text was also published as ''Peter Pan Keepsake'' but illustrated with photographs from the first productions.<ref>O'Connor, Daniel. ''Peter Pan Keepsake''. Chatto & Windus (1907)</ref> This story differs from Barrie's own 1911 novelisation because he had made several changes to his play and story since it was first staged in 1904.\n*'''''Peter Pan and the Only Children''''' by [[Gilbert Adair]] (1987), an unauthorised sequel/prequel novel. This book is written and presented in a format similar to ''Peter and Wendy'', with bound-in colour illustrations by Jenny Thorne. It has Peter living with a different gang of Lost Boys under the ocean, recruiting \"only children\" who jump from passing ships as new members, including the newest: 10-year-old Marissa Porter. They have adventures under the sea, including a duel with Captain Hook which ends indecisively. The narrator suggests at the end that perhaps this is a ''prequel'' to the adventure with Wendy Darling, or they take place without sequence. Adair's previous novel was ''[[Alice through the Needle's Eye]]'', a sequel to the [[Alice in Wonderland]] stories.\n*'''''Neverland''''' by Toby Forward (1989), where Peter Pan, Captain Hook etc. are brought back to life through a computer game. Published by Simon & Schuster when Peter Pan first entered the public domain in the UK, before the copyright was revived in 1995.\n*'''''Hook''''' by [[Terry Brooks]] (1991), a novelization of [[Hook (film)|the Spielberg film]].\n*'''''After the Rain: A New Adventure for Peter Pan''''' by J. E. Somma (1999), an unauthorised sequel novel. Set in modern times, telling of Peter's reaction to a world that has grown to neglect him, and his rescue by three children who teach him that it's OK to grow up. It was published without incident in Canada, where the copyright to Peter Pan was generally agreed to have expired, but Somma and GOSH were in legal dispute when it was published in the U.S. in 2002, where GOSH claimed their copyrights were still valid. They eventually settled out of court.<ref>[http://neverpedia.info/pan/After_the_Rain Neverpedia: After the Rain]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*'''''Wendy''''' by Karen Wallace (2003), an unauthorised prequel novel for [[Youth|young adults]]. An attempt to explain the Darling children's willingness to fly away with Peter on the grounds that their home life, up until shortly before Peter appeared, had been filled with abuse and tragedy: a cruel [[nanny]], a criminally irresponsible father, and a suggestion of insanity in the family.\n*'''''Jardines de Kensington''''' (translated as \"Kensington Gardens\") by [[Rodrigo Fres\u00e1n]] (2003), interweaves the story of Peter Pan, his creator JM Barrie, and various aspects of 1960s London pop culture.

[[Mary Martin]] played TV's Peter Pan for the third time on 8 December 1960 with many of the same cast members, and this version of the 1954 musical was recorded on color [[videotape]], and repeated in 1963, 1966, and 1973. It was presented by NBC as a stand-alone special program rather than as part of ''Producer's Showcase''. After 1973, it was presumed lost and not broadcast again until March 1989, after which it eventually appeared a few times on the [[Disney Channel]]. It was also released on videocassette and briefly on DVD.

M. Barrie]]. The earliest were the stage productions of the play, and an adaptation to [[silent film]], done with Barrie's involvement and personal approval. Later works were authorised by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], to which Barrie gave the rights to the Peter Pan works; these include adaptations of the main story in both [[animation|animated]] and [[live-action film]]s, [[musicals|musical stage productions]], and a [[sequel]] [[novel]]. In addition, there have been numerous uses of Barrie's characters, settings, and storylines which challenged or took advantage of the changing [[copyright]] status of these elements, including reinterpretations, sequels, [[prequel]]s, and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s in a variety of media, including film, television series, and books.\n\nAdaptations of ''Peter Pan'' for public performance have a unique status in UK copyright law: [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] has the right to receive [[royalties]] in perpetuity under specific provisions in the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988#Peter Pan|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]].\n\nWhen dramatized, the character of Peter has usually\u2014but not always\u2014been played by an adult woman. For boys' roles to be played by women is a convention of the [[pantomime]] tradition that was popular when the play was first produced, and was necessitated by laws restricting the use of child actors for evening performances. Later adaptations have often followed this example, for reasons that include tradition, the performance demands of the role, and the marketing advantages of \"star\" actresses. The roles of [[Captain Hook]] and [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|George Darling]] happened to be played by the same actor in the original production, a tradition which has sometimes been continued in later dramatic adaptations.\n\n==Books and publications==\n\n===Original works===\n* 1904 \u2013 ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' (play): Peter brings Wendy and her brothers to Neverland, where he has a showdown with his nemesis, Captain Hook. This play was adapted as a novel by Barrie. Variations and adaptations have been produced in various media.\n* 1906 \u2013 ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'': an origin story where the infant Peter flies away from his home, takes up residence in Kensington Gardens and makes friends with the fairies. It is a \"book-within-a-book\" that was first published in Barrie's The Little White Bird in 1902.\n* 1908 \u2013 ''When Wendy Grew Up \u2013 An Afterthought'', a short sequel play first staged in 1908, but only published in book form in 1957.\n* 1911 \u2013 ''Peter and Wendy'' (novel), later published as ''Peter Pan and Wendy'', adapted as a novel from the play, it also incorporates events from ''When Wendy Grew Up \u2013 An Afterthought''.\n\n===Literary \u2013 Fiction===\n*'''''The Peter Pan Picture Book''''' (sometimes entitled ''The Story of Peter Pan''), retold by Daniel O'Connor, illustrated by [[Alice B.

The 1954 stage version was re-staged for television by NBC as part of its monthly high-quality [[anthology series]] ''Producers' Showcase'' and broadcast as a historic, live [[color television]] event. The production was so well received that ''Producers' Showcase'' produced a second live presentation on 9 January 1956, with the same cast. [[Mary Martin]] played TV's Peter Pan for the third time on 8 December 1960 with many of the same cast members, and this version of the 1954 musical was recorded on color [[videotape]], and repeated in 1963, 1966, and 1973. It was presented by NBC as a stand-alone special program rather than as part of ''Producer's Showcase''. After 1973, it was presumed lost and not broadcast again until March 1989, after which it eventually appeared a few times on the [[Disney Channel]]. It was also released on videocassette and briefly on DVD. In 2000, the Cathy Rigby stage production, featuring almost all of the songs used in the 1954 version, was telecast by the [[A&E Network]] and issued on DVD.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054176/ Peter Pan (1960) (TV)]</ref> \n*''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'': '''''[[Peter Pan (1976 musical)|Peter Pan]]''''' (12 December 1976).

Hendrix supplied his own interpretations, however, which gave them a much different character than the originals.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2010|pp=10, 37}} \n\nHendrix was known for his live performances.{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|loc=eBook}} While he often played the numbers from his studio albums, several released songs exist only in live recordings. His radical interpretation of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", which he performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock]] music festival, was a highlight of the event's [[Woodstock (film)|1970 documentary film]], becoming \"part of the sixties [[Zeitgeist]].\"{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=271\u2013272}}  The live \"Machine Gun\" is often lauded as Hendrix's greatest achievement, in which he used the guitar to create sounds of a battlefield and noises similar to explosions, bombs dropping, and machine guns.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|pp=212\u2013213}}  Other songs only performed in concert show his interest in different styles of music.{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|loc=eBook}} These include interpretations of blues songs by artists such as [[Howlin' Wolf]] (\"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\"), [[B.B. King]] (\"[[Rock Me Baby (song)|Rock Me Baby]]\"), and [[Muddy Waters]] (\"Catfish Blues\"); the early [[rock and roll]] numbers \"[[Johnny B.

The long studio jam \"[[Voodoo Chile]]\", which Hendrix developed into \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", was recorded with organist [[Steve Winwood]] and bassist [[Jack Casady]].{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=101}} Jamming was integral to his songwriting process{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=203}} and several posthumous post-1980 albums contain songs that are largely studio jams with various players.<ref name=\"morning symphony ideas\"/><ref name=\"hear my music\"/><ref name=\"burning desire\"/> How much of this material Hendrix would have completed or released is unknown, but nonetheless has become part of his recording legacy.{{sfn|Geldeart|Rodham|2007|p=111}}\n\nIn his writings, performances, and in the recording studio, Hendrix often referred to songs using alternate titles.{{sfn|Geldeart|Rodham|2007|loc=Song listings}}{{efn|Hendrix usually introduced performances of \"[[Hear My Train A Comin']]\" as \"Get My Heart Back Together\", but added a train reference such as \"Lonesome Train\",<ref>\n{{cite AV media\n| people = Jimi Hendrix\n| year = 1986\n| title = [[Band of Gypsys 2]]\n| chapter = Hear My Train A Comin'\n| medium = Song recording\n| time = \n| location = Hollywood California\n| publisher = [[Capitol Records]]\n| id = SJ-12416\n}}</ref> \"I See My Train\",<ref>\n{{cite AV media\n| people = Jimi Hendrix\n| year = 1982\n| title = [[The Jimi Hendrix Concerts]]\n| chapter = Hear My Train A Comin'\n| medium = Song recording\n| time = \n| location = Burbank, California\n| publisher = [[Reprise Records]]\n| id = MS 2306-1\n}}</ref> and \"Waitin' Down at the Train Station\".<ref>\n{{cite AV media\n| people = Jimi Hendrix\n| year = 1994\n| title = [[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]\n| chapter = Hear My Train A Comin'\n| medium = Song recording\n| time = \n| location = Universal City, California\n| publisher = [[MCA Records]]\n| id = MCAD-11060\n}}</ref>}}  Record companies in the US and UK sometimes issued his songs with differences in the spelling; [[Track Records]] (UK) used \"[[Foxy Lady]]\", while [[Reprise Records]] (US) spelled it \"Foxey Lady\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=528, 531}} Later album producers changed some titles or supplied their own, when a formal name had not been identified.{{efn|Hendrix's manager, [[Michael Jeffery (manager)|Michael Jeffery]], later titled an unnamed studio jam \"Pali Gap\" in an attempt to make it appear related to the Hawaiian locale of his 1971 ''[[Rainbow Bridge (film)|Rainbow Bridge]]'' film project.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=310}}}}\n\n==Main songs (1966\u20131970)==\nSixty songs were issued during Hendrix's lifetime, principally on the first three studio albums, a compilation, and a split live album under the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] name:{{sfn|Belmo|Loveless|1998|pp=29\u201330, 35\u201337}}{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=526\u2013538}}\n*''[[Are You Experienced]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' (1968)\n*''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968)\n*''[[Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival]]'' (1970)\nAdditional songs recorded live were issued on ''[[Band of Gypsys]]'' (1970) and the various artists release ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'' (1970).{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=535\u2013537}} Two songs recorded with the Band of Gypsys lineup were issued as a single in 1970.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=535}}\n{{Compact ToC|num=yes|d=|j=|k=|n=|q=||x=|z=}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n!

As of the morning of December 29, 2011, the official list had 18 fewer supporters, including only 124 of the original 142 supporters. The growing publicity of this list on websites such as [[Reddit]] resulted in what might be referred to as a public relations disaster for some of the supporters listed. Arguably the first and most prominent case regarded [[Go Daddy|GoDaddy.com]], a popular internet domain registrar and web hosting company which openly supported SOPA. GoDaddy sustained significant losses, losing over 72,000 domains in less than one week, as a result of a proposed boycott of their services, pending it renounce its support of SOPA. GoDaddy has since announced that it \"no longer supports SOPA legislation,\" then amended that statement to \"GoDaddy OPPOSES SOPA.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=GoDaddy bows to boycott, now 'opposes' SOPA copyright bill |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57349913-281/godaddy-bows-to-boycott-now-opposes-sopa-copyright-bill/ |website=News.cnet.com |accessdate=29 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations supporting SOPA==\n<!-- PLEASE KEEP THIS LIST ALPHABETIZED.

including the Motion Picture Association of America,<ref name=\"HuffPost\">{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/14/white-house-sopa-pipa_n_1206347.html |title=White House Will Not

Macmillan Publishers, Viacom, and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]], the bill's sponsor, released a list of 142 organizations that support SOPA on the [[House Judiciary Committee]]'s website.<ref name=\"Supporters\">Smith, Lamar ''United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee'' List of Supporters H.R. 3661, the \"Stop Online Piracy Act\" [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Iqvu-xQP77EJ:judiciary.house.gov/issues/Rogue%2520Websites/List%2520of%2520SOPA%2520Supporters.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg0oCVA4hmp-4nqUR1Uddu-VOeYCMHj1NxjckCTPIQ7vtbDdiQn1is8ThqEsYn1lOOmtsK9N2aHSeI7ZMVwqmGuRBvb0zYcvVkzFx24r02uZkb1vrX2v2_0QNL0iA-QmoJeP_bO&sig=AHIEtbSdnMcencdkTTXQMM-L7PxwqHaf3Q&pli=1 ]</ref> Other lists have been released by the organizations themselves.\n\nFollowing the list's original release, it was updated multiple times. As of the morning of December 29, 2011, the official list had 18 fewer supporters, including only 124 of the original 142 supporters. The growing publicity of this list on websites such as [[Reddit]] resulted in what might be referred to as a public relations disaster for some of the supporters listed. Arguably the first and most prominent case regarded [[Go Daddy|GoDaddy.com]], a popular internet domain registrar and web hosting company which openly supported SOPA. GoDaddy sustained significant losses, losing over 72,000 domains in less than one week, as a result of a proposed boycott of their services, pending it renounce its support of SOPA. GoDaddy has since announced that it \"no longer supports SOPA legislation,\" then amended that statement to \"GoDaddy OPPOSES SOPA.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=GoDaddy bows to boycott, now 'opposes' SOPA copyright bill |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57349913-281/godaddy-bows-to-boycott-now-opposes-sopa-copyright-bill/ |website=News.cnet.com |accessdate=29 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations supporting SOPA==\n<!-- PLEASE KEEP THIS LIST ALPHABETIZED.

{"title_page": "Wurmbrand-Stuppach", "text_new": "'''Wurmbrand-Stuppach''' is an old noble family of [[Austria]]. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Counts of Wurmbrand-Stuppach gained notability in wars against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in the [[Balkans]]. The Counts of Wurmbrand-Stuppach were highly decorated advisors to the [[Habsburg]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperors]]. During the 18th century the family had [[Imperial immediacy|immediate status]] as ruling counts of a small territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and as such, the family belonged to [[high nobility]].\n\n== The Wurmbrand Saga ==\nThe founding of the house of Wurmbrand-Stuppach, and the origins of the name, occurred during the [[Crusades]]. The Count of [[Stuppach]] had disappeared seven years earlier fighting in the [[Holy Land]], and the knights were getting impatient on waiting for his wife and successor to remarry. A [[lindworm]] (a mythological two-legged [[wyvern]]-like creature) had entered the County and began to terrorise the land. The knights demanded she marry a brave nobleman to fight it.\n\nThe Countess asked for four weeks' delay, and when that time had passed she said to the knights \"I asked God. He likes my husband to return to me, if he still lives. To my sadness he did not come. Give me still four weeks period.\" But the people would not have another four weeks delay due to the lindworm, so she instead announced that she would marry whoever slayed the beast.\n\nSilently, the knights left. Those which went to slay the lindworm did not return. One day, a poor farmer was on the Burglach making fences when the lindworm appeared. It lunged at the farmer, which speared the lindworm in the mouth with a stake he was using to build the fences. Other farmers who were nearby saw it, and they carried him to the countess to be married. The wedding lasted a week.\n\n== History ==\nThe family is first mentioned with ''Leupold dem Wurmbrant'' in 1194. They originate from the [[Bucklige Welt]] region in Lower Austria. At the end of the 12th century they received the fief of Stuppach castle near [[Gloggnitz]] which remained in their possession until 1659.\n\n[[File:Burg Steyersberg (Warth (Nieder\u00f6sterreich)) 01.jpg|thumb|Steyersberg Castle, Lower Austria]] \nIn 1600, they acquired Steyersberg castle near [[Warth, Lower Austria]].\n\nEhrenreich the Elder (1558- c. 1620) became baron in 1607. His children became counts in 1682. Count Johann Josef Wilhelm (1670\u20131750), president of the [[Aulic Council]], was honored by the Emperor by being made a personal (not yet hereditary) member of the ''Franconian count's bench'', a part of the college of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Princes]] (''Reichsf\u00fcrstenrat'' or ''F\u00fcrstenbank'') in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1726. Upon his admission he had to promise to purchase some [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] territory on the first occasion, since all of the family's possessions had no such status as they were located within the [[Archduchy of Austria]]. Finally a splinter share of the immediate ''County of Limpurg'' was inherited by Johann Josef Wilhelm's wife Juliane Dorothea von Limpurg-Gaildorf, a territory around its residence [[Gaildorf]], Swabia, that had been divided between a large number of heirs when its former rulers, the counts ''Schenk von Limpurg'' extinguished in 1713, leaving ten daughters. With this splinter share, the acquisition of a territory with Imperial Immediacy was fulfilled and the head of the family became a hereditary member of the ''Swabian count's bench''. The county of Limpurg was mediatized in 1806 and became part of the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The [[Mediatized Houses]] however kept their princely status.\n\nThe elder branch extinguished with count Degenhard in 1965, and his only daughter Leonora inherited Steyersberg castle; it is now owned by her son Dr Paul Miller. The headship of the house went to count Ernst Gundaccar (b. 1946) of the younger branch, formerly residing at Libl\u00edn (Czech Republic). His mother, the heiress of [[Schloss Frohsdorf]], was princess Blanca [[Massimo family|Massimo]], daughter of princess Beatrix, herself a daughter of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid]]. Frohsdorf castle was sold in 1941, but the estate is still owned by count Ernst Gundaccar who has two sons. Schloss Stubenberg in Styria was bought in 1815 and given to the Catholic Church in 1925 as a monastery, when two daughters took the veil.\n\n[[File:Schloss Schielleiten, south front.jpg|thumb|Schielleiten Palace]] \nThe third branch resided at Reitenau castle near [[Stambach]] (1602-1822) and at [[Gornja Radgona Castle]] (1789-1914). In 1694 they purchased Altschielleiten castle at [[Stubenberg, Styria]], where the new Schielleiten Palace was built from 1730.
