{"title_page": "Hablot Knight Browne", "text_new": "{{short description|British artist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|thumb|Browne photographed by [[Napoleon Sarony|Sarony]] c.1870s]]\n'''Hablot Knight Browne''' (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist and illustrator.  Well-known by his pen name, '''Phiz''', he illustrated books by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Charles Lever]], and [[Harrison Ainsworth]].\n\n==Early life==\nOf [[Huguenot]] ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in [[Lambeth]] (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to biographer, Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of [[Napoleon]]'s [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e#Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]]. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book ''Phiz!: Illustrator of Dickens' World'' says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' and 15 June 1815 (''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned the family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to [[Philadelphia]] where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/phiz-dickens-and-london\n|title=Phiz, Dickens and London\n|author=Valerie Browne Lester\n|publisher=Gresham College\n|date=28 November 2006\n|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to [[William Finden]], an [[engraving|engraver]], in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of [[John Gilpin]], he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\n==Career==\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  ''[[The Pickwick Papers|Pickwick]]''. Browne became the illustrator of his little pamphlet ''Sunday under Three Heads''. In the original edition of ''Pickwick'', issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]],  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by [[Robert William Buss]].\n\n[[File:Betsey trotwood by phiz.jpg|thumb|right|1849 [[etching]] for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', titled \"I make myself known to my aunt\"]]\n\nBrowne and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two [[etching|etched]] plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo\", but the third was signed \"Phiz\", a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz\".\n\nPhiz developed the character [[Sam_Weller_(character)|Sam Weller]] graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to [[Yorkshire]] to see the schools of which [[Nicholas Nickleby]] became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', ''Pickwick'', ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' and ''[[Bleak House]]''. Browne made several drawings for ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to ''Punch's Pocket Books''.\n\n[[File:I am married by Phiz.jpg|thumb|left|1850 etching for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', titled \"I am married\"]]\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them ''Harry Lorrequer'', ''Charles O'Malley'', ''Jack Hinton'' and the ''Knight of Gwynne''). He also illustrated [[Harrison Ainsworth]]'s and [[Frank Smedley]]'s novels. ''Mervyn Clitheroe'' by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. \n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as [[lithograph]]ic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling [[mezzotint]], which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\n==Death==\nBrowne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the [[Royal Academy]]. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\n==Legacy==\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the [[Royal Mail]] in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://shop.royalmail.com/charles-dickens/charles-dickens-miniature-sheet/invt/sku00000815/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234140/http://shop.royalmail.com/charles-dickens/charles-dickens-miniature-sheet/invt/sku00000815/|archive-date=2013-12-02\n|title=Charles Dickens\n|publisher=Royal Mail\n|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:hablot-browne.jpg|Portrait engraving\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from ''[[Auriol (novel)|Auriol]]'' by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to ''Pelham'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], 1849\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author-link=John Forster (biographer)|first=John |last=Forster|title=Life of Charles Dickens|location=London|date= 1871\u20131874|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kitton|first=Frederick George |authorlink=Frederick George Kitton|title=\"Phiz\" (Hablot Knight Browne): A Memoir, Including a Selection from His Correspondence and Notes on His Principal Works|url=https://archive.org/details/phizhablotknight00kitt|year=1882|publisher=W.

Well-known by his pen name, '''Phiz''', he illustrated books by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Charles Lever]], and [[Harrison Ainsworth]].\n\n==Early life==\nOf [[Huguenot]] ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in [[Lambeth]] (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to biographer, Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of [[Napoleon]]'s [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e#Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]]. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book ''Phiz!: Illustrator of Dickens' World'' says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' and 15 June 1815 (''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned the family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to [[Philadelphia]] where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/phiz-dickens-and-london\n|title=Phiz, Dickens and London\n|author=Valerie Browne Lester\n|publisher=Gresham College\n|date=28 November 2006\n|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to [[William Finden]], an [[engraving|engraver]], in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of [[John Gilpin]], he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\n==Career==\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  ''[[The Pickwick Papers|Pickwick]]''. Browne became the illustrator of his little pamphlet ''Sunday under Three Heads''. In the original edition of ''Pickwick'', issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]],  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by [[Robert William Buss]].\n\n[[File:Betsey trotwood by phiz.jpg|thumb|right|1849 [[etching]] for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', titled \"I make myself known to my aunt\"]]\n\nBrowne and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two [[etching|etched]] plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo\", but the third was signed \"Phiz\", a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz\".\n\nPhiz developed the character [[Sam_Weller_(character)|Sam Weller]] graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to [[Yorkshire]] to see the schools of which [[Nicholas Nickleby]] became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', ''Pickwick'', ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' and ''[[Bleak House]]''. Browne made several drawings for ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to ''Punch's Pocket Books''.\n\n[[File:I am married by Phiz.jpg|thumb|left|1850 etching for ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', titled \"I am married\"]]\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them ''Harry Lorrequer'', ''Charles O'Malley'', ''Jack Hinton'' and the ''Knight of Gwynne''). He also illustrated [[Harrison Ainsworth]]'s and [[Frank Smedley]]'s novels. ''Mervyn Clitheroe'' by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. \n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as [[lithograph]]ic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling [[mezzotint]], which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\n==Death==\nBrowne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the [[Royal Academy]]. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\n==Legacy==\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the [[Royal Mail]] in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://shop.royalmail.com/charles-dickens/charles-dickens-miniature-sheet/invt/sku00000815/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234140/http://shop.royalmail.com/charles-dickens/charles-dickens-miniature-sheet/invt/sku00000815/|archive-date=2013-12-02\n|title=Charles Dickens\n|publisher=Royal Mail\n|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:hablot-browne.jpg|Portrait engraving\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from ''[[Auriol (novel)|Auriol]]'' by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to ''Pelham'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], 1849\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author-link=John Forster (biographer)|first=John |last=Forster|title=Life of Charles Dickens|location=London|date= 1871\u20131874|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kitton|first=Frederick George |authorlink=Frederick George Kitton|title=\"Phiz\" (Hablot Knight Browne): A Memoir, Including a Selection from His Correspondence and Notes on His Principal Works|url=https://archive.org/details/phizhablotknight00kitt|year=1882|publisher=W.

The idea behind starting a comic book series devoted to Indian culture and history came to Pai from a quiz contest aired on [[Doordarshan]] in February 1967, in which participants could easily answer questions pertaining to Greek mythology, but were unable to reply to the question \"In the [[Ramayana]], who was Rama's mother?\"\n\nPai left his job at Times of India, and started '''ACK ([[Amar Chitra Katha]])''' the same year, with the help of late '''G.L. Mirchandani''' of IBH, (who also took charge as the command of Tinkle late when it was formed), when most other publishers had rejected the concept. Later, he took on the role of writer, editor and publisher. The series went on to become a publishing milestone for the Indian comic book scene, selling over 90 million copies of about 440 titles (as per last count till the end of 2008).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicology.in/2009/01/tinkle-kalia-suppandi-shikari-shambu.html|title=Tinkle \u2013 Kalia {{!}} Suppandi {{!}} Shikari Shambu {{!}} 2007 - Comicology|website=www.comicology.in|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref> He has also launched the popular series.\n\nIn June 2018, Tinkle Comics reprinted the Original Series in three volumes, with Tinkle stories and features from issue #1 to #18, originally published between December 1980 and April 1982.\n\n==Popular comics==\nApart from one-off stories, ''Tinkle'' also has regular characters that appear in stand-alone fashion.

The idea behind starting a comic book series devoted to Indian culture and history came to Pai from a quiz contest aired on [[Doordarshan]] in February 1967, in which participants could easily answer questions pertaining to Greek mythology, but were unable to reply to the question \"In the [[Ramayana]], who was Rama's mother?\"\n\nPai left his job at Times of India, and started '''ACK ([[Amar Chitra Katha]])''' the same year, with the help of late '''G.L. Mirchandani''' of IBH, (who also took charge as the command of Tinkle late when it was formed), when most other publishers had rejected the concept. Later, he took on the role of writer, editor and publisher. The series went on to become a publishing milestone for the Indian comic book scene, selling over 90 million copies of about 440 titles (as per last count till the end of 2008).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicology.in/2009/01/tinkle-kalia-suppandi-shikari-shambu.html|title=Tinkle \u2013 Kalia {{!}} Suppandi {{!}} Shikari Shambu {{!}} 2007 - Comicology|website=www.comicology.in|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref> He has also launched the popular series.\n\nIn June 2018, Tinkle Comics reprinted the Original Series in three volumes, with Tinkle stories and features from issue #1 to #18, originally published between December 1980 and April 1982.\n\n==Popular comics==\nApart from one-off stories, ''Tinkle'' also has regular characters that appear in stand-alone fashion.

Retrieved March 24, 2010</ref> The film was nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Saturn Awards|Saturn]] awards.\n\n''Westworld'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), and a short-lived television series, ''[[Beyond Westworld]]'' (1980). [[Westworld (TV series)|A television series]] based on the film debuted in 2016 on [[HBO]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the then-future year of 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult [[amusement park]] called Delos features three themed \"worlds\": Western World (the [[American Old West]]), Medieval World ([[medieval Europe]]), and Roman World (the [[ancient Roman]] city of [[Pompeii]]). The resort's three \"worlds\" are populated with lifelike [[Android (robot)|android]]s that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\nPeter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the [[Gunfighter|Gunslinger]], an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\n\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to [[Computer virus|spread like an infection among the androids]]: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \"analogy of an infectious disease\", he is told by the chief supervisor \"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been [[Computer-aided engineering|designed by other computers]]. We don't know exactly how they work.\"\n\nThe malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld, and, against its programming, an android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's [[Black knight|Black Knight]] android kills a guest in a [[Swordsmanship|sword fight]]. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. However, the shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. Meanwhile, the androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.\n\nMartin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's [[brothel]], unaware of the park's massive breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement until the android outdraws and shoots, killing him. Martin runs for his life and the android implacably follows.\n\nMartin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only dead guests, damaged androids, and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is shortly thereafter shot by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger enters the room, Martin pretends to be an android, throws acid into the Gunslinger's face, and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.\n\nWith its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track Martin visually and tries to find Martin using its [[infrared]] scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the android, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. Martin sits on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the irony of Delos' slogan resonates: \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Peter Martin\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Blane\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the Chief Supervisor\n* [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]] as the Medieval Queen\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as the Banker\n* [[Linda Gaye Scott|Linda Scott]] as Arlette, the French prostitute\n* [[Steve Franken]] as the Delos technician shot dead by the Gunslinger\n* Michael Mikler as the Black Knight\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Majel Barrett]] as Miss Carrie, madame of the Westworld bordello\n* [[Anne Randall]] as Daphne, the serving-maid who refuses the Medieval Knight's advances\n* [[Nora Marlowe]] as the Hostess\n* [[Charles Seel]] as the Bellhop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nCrichton said he did not wish to make his feature directorial debut (after one TV film) with science fiction but \"That's the only way I could get the studio to let me direct.

Crichton said:\n\n{{Quote | MGM had a bad reputation among filmmakers; in recent years, directors as diverse as [[Robert Altman]], [[Blake Edwards]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fred Zinneman]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had complained bitterly about their treatment there. There were too many stories of unreasonable pressure, arbitrary script changes, inadequate post production, and cavalier recutting of the final film. Nobody who had a choice made a picture at Metro, but then we didn't have a choice. Dan Melnick&nbsp;... assured [us]&nbsp;... that we would not be subjected to the usual MGM treatment. In large part, he made good on that promise.<ref>Crichton p. ix</ref>}}\n\nCrichton said pre-production was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting<ref name=\"los\"/> and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000.<ref name=\"Crichton p x\"/> Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).<ref>Crichton p. x\u2013xi</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n''Westworld'' was filmed in several locations, including the [[Mojave Desert]], the gardens of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]], several MGM [[sound stage]]s and on the MGM [[backlot]], one of the final films to be shot there.<ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> It was filmed with [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses by [[Gene Polito]].\n\nRichard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:\n\n{{Quote | It probably was the only way I was ever going to get into a Western, and certainly into a science-fiction Western.... So you get to do stuff that's like you're 12 years old. All of the reasons you went to the movies in the first place.

The two characters' costumes are nearly identical.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Lester D. |title=American Cinema of the 1970s: Themes and Variations |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2007 |location=Camden |isbn=0-8135-4023-2 |page=100}}</ref> According to Lazarus, Yul Brynner agreed to play the role for only $75,000, because he needed the money.<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nIn the scene when Richard Benjamin's character splashes the Gunslinger in the face with acid, Brynner's face was covered with an oil-based makeup mixed with ground [[Alka-Seltzer]]. A splash of water then produced the fizzing effect.\n\nThe score for ''Westworld'' was composed by American composer [[Fred Karlin]]. It combines [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] western scoring, [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|source cues]], and [[electronic music]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/cdID/348/ |title=Film Score Monthly CD: Coma/Westworld/The Carey Treatment |website= Filmscoremonthly.com |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCrichton later wrote that since \"most of the situations in the film are cliches; they are incidents out of hundreds of old movies\" that the scenes \"should be shot as [[clich\u00e9]]s. This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging.\"<ref>Crichton p. xiii</ref>\n\nThe movie was shot in 30 days. In order to save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed.<ref>Crichton p. xvi</ref>\n\nThe original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he \"had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine\", but when attempting it, \"it seemed stagey and foolish\", so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\">Crichton p. xix</ref> He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert, but was unable to get the effect he wanted, so this was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nIn the novelization, Crichton explained how he re-edited the first cut of the movie, because he was depressed by how long and boring it was. Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter, and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton's assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between Gunslinger and Peter, and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putlearningfirst.com/br/westworldshoot.html|title=Shooting Westworld}}</ref>\n\nA Yul Brynner biography mentions that 10 minutes of \"adult material\" was cut, because of the censors, probably for [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#From M to GP to PG|PG rating]], but no details about footage that was cut for rating issues were mentioned in Brynner's biography or anywhere else.\n\nOnce the film was completed, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers' strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.<ref>Crichton p xvii</ref>\n\n===Digital image processing===\n''Westworld'' was the first feature film to use [[digital image processing]]. Crichton originally went to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney Sr.]], who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to [[Information International, Inc.]], where they could work at night and complete the animation both faster and much more cheaply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/512325-whitney-family-pioneers-computer-animation/|title=The Whitney Family: Pioneers in Computer Animation |website=Tested.com}}</ref> Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear [[Pixelization|pixelized]] in order to portray the Gunslinger android's [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]].<ref name=yaeger/> The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds' worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source [[70 mm film]] images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec17.php |title=Ed Manning BlocPix |website=Atariarchives.org |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |title=Chapter 4: A HISTORY OF COMPUTER ANIMATION 3/20/92 (note that this article is in error about the year the film was made) |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406031124/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The process was covered in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article \"Behind the scenes of Westworld\"<ref>''[[American Cinematographer]]'' 54(11):1394-1397, 1420-1421, 1436-1437.

[[Westworld (TV series)|A television series]] based on the film debuted in 2016 on [[HBO]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the then-future year of 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult [[amusement park]] called Delos features three themed \"worlds\": Western World (the [[American Old West]]), Medieval World ([[medieval Europe]]), and Roman World (the [[ancient Roman]] city of [[Pompeii]]). The resort's three \"worlds\" are populated with lifelike [[Android (robot)|android]]s that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\nPeter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the [[Gunfighter|Gunslinger]], an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\n\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to [[Computer virus|spread like an infection among the androids]]: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \"analogy of an infectious disease\", he is told by the chief supervisor \"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been [[Computer-aided engineering|designed by other computers]]. We don't know exactly how they work.\"\n\nThe malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld, and, against its programming, an android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's [[Black knight|Black Knight]] android kills a guest in a [[Swordsmanship|sword fight]]. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. However, the shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. Meanwhile, the androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.\n\nMartin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's [[brothel]], unaware of the park's massive breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement until the android outdraws and shoots, killing him. Martin runs for his life and the android implacably follows.\n\nMartin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only dead guests, damaged androids, and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is shortly thereafter shot by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger enters the room, Martin pretends to be an android, throws acid into the Gunslinger's face, and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.\n\nWith its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track Martin visually and tries to find Martin using its [[infrared]] scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the android, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. Martin sits on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the irony of Delos' slogan resonates: \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Peter Martin\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Blane\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the Chief Supervisor\n* [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]] as the Medieval Queen\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as the Banker\n* [[Linda Gaye Scott|Linda Scott]] as Arlette, the French prostitute\n* [[Steve Franken]] as the Delos technician shot dead by the Gunslinger\n* Michael Mikler as the Black Knight\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Majel Barrett]] as Miss Carrie, madame of the Westworld bordello\n* [[Anne Randall]] as Daphne, the serving-maid who refuses the Medieval Knight's advances\n* [[Nora Marlowe]] as the Hostess\n* [[Charles Seel]] as the Bellhop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nCrichton said he did not wish to make his feature directorial debut (after one TV film) with science fiction but \"That's the only way I could get the studio to let me direct.

Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] January 4, 1974: d12.</ref>\n\nCrichton's agent introduced him to producer [[Paul N. Lazarus III]]; they became friends and decided to make a film together.<ref name=\"pod\">{{cite podcast|url=http://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/paul-lazarus-legends-of-film/|title=Legends of Film: Paul Lazarus|date=December 27, 2004}}</ref> The script was written in August 1972. Lazarus says he asked Crichton why he did not tell the story as a book; Crichton said he felt the story was visual, and would not really work as a book.<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nThe script was offered to all the major studios. They all turned down the project except for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then under head of production [[Dan Melnick]] and president [[James T. Aubrey]]. Crichton said:\n\n{{Quote | MGM had a bad reputation among filmmakers; in recent years, directors as diverse as [[Robert Altman]], [[Blake Edwards]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fred Zinneman]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had complained bitterly about their treatment there. There were too many stories of unreasonable pressure, arbitrary script changes, inadequate post production, and cavalier recutting of the final film. Nobody who had a choice made a picture at Metro, but then we didn't have a choice. Dan Melnick&nbsp;... assured [us]&nbsp;... that we would not be subjected to the usual MGM treatment. In large part, he made good on that promise.<ref>Crichton p. ix</ref>}}\n\nCrichton said pre-production was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting<ref name=\"los\"/> and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000.<ref name=\"Crichton p x\"/> Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).<ref>Crichton p. x\u2013xi</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n''Westworld'' was filmed in several locations, including the [[Mojave Desert]], the gardens of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]], several MGM [[sound stage]]s and on the MGM [[backlot]], one of the final films to be shot there.<ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> It was filmed with [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses by [[Gene Polito]].\n\nRichard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:\n\n{{Quote | It probably was the only way I was ever going to get into a Western, and certainly into a science-fiction Western.... So you get to do stuff that's like you're 12 years old. All of the reasons you went to the movies in the first place.

A splash of water then produced the fizzing effect.\n\nThe score for ''Westworld'' was composed by American composer [[Fred Karlin]]. It combines [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] western scoring, [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|source cues]], and [[electronic music]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/cdID/348/ |title=Film Score Monthly CD: Coma/Westworld/The Carey Treatment |website= Filmscoremonthly.com |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCrichton later wrote that since \"most of the situations in the film are cliches; they are incidents out of hundreds of old movies\" that the scenes \"should be shot as [[clich\u00e9]]s. This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging.\"<ref>Crichton p. xiii</ref>\n\nThe movie was shot in 30 days. In order to save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed.<ref>Crichton p. xvi</ref>\n\nThe original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he \"had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine\", but when attempting it, \"it seemed stagey and foolish\", so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\">Crichton p. xix</ref> He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert, but was unable to get the effect he wanted, so this was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nIn the novelization, Crichton explained how he re-edited the first cut of the movie, because he was depressed by how long and boring it was. Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter, and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton's assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between Gunslinger and Peter, and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putlearningfirst.com/br/westworldshoot.html|title=Shooting Westworld}}</ref>\n\nA Yul Brynner biography mentions that 10 minutes of \"adult material\" was cut, because of the censors, probably for [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#From M to GP to PG|PG rating]], but no details about footage that was cut for rating issues were mentioned in Brynner's biography or anywhere else.\n\nOnce the film was completed, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers' strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.<ref>Crichton p xvii</ref>\n\n===Digital image processing===\n''Westworld'' was the first feature film to use [[digital image processing]]. Crichton originally went to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney Sr.]], who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to [[Information International, Inc.]], where they could work at night and complete the animation both faster and much more cheaply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/512325-whitney-family-pioneers-computer-animation/|title=The Whitney Family: Pioneers in Computer Animation |website=Tested.com}}</ref> Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear [[Pixelization|pixelized]] in order to portray the Gunslinger android's [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]].<ref name=yaeger/> The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds' worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source [[70 mm film]] images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec17.php |title=Ed Manning BlocPix |website=Atariarchives.org |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |title=Chapter 4: A HISTORY OF COMPUTER ANIMATION 3/20/92 (note that this article is in error about the year the film was made) |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406031124/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The process was covered in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article \"Behind the scenes of Westworld\"<ref>''[[American Cinematographer]]'' 54(11):1394-1397, 1420-1421, 1436-1437.

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works]] Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1485/>\n\n[[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones.

During the drive, Tony is taken aback when she asks if he is \"in the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]\", and denies it. When Meadow is skeptical, he admits that a portion of his income is from [[illegal gambling]] and other activities. Meadow admits that she took [[methamphetamine|speed]] to study for [[SAT]]s, but when Tony reacts angrily, will not say where she got it. Both seem relieved by this mutual honesty on difficult topics.\n\nAt a gas station, Tony thinks he spots [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio|Fabian Petrulio]], a former member of the [[DiMeo crime family]] who turned [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant and was relocated under the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]]. Tony resolves to locate and execute Petrulio while continuing his trip with Meadow. He leaves her with some students she has met, and confirms Petrulio's identity when he sees a bust of [[Ronald Reagan]] in his office, similar to those he sculpted while in prison. Petrulio spots Tony and, carrying a handgun, tracks him back to the motel where he and Meadow are staying. However, the presence of two other guests prevents him from taking a shot.\n\nThe next morning, Tony drops off Meadow for an interview. He finds Petrulio at his office, and garrottes him with a length of wire. During the drive later, Meadow asks Tony about the mud on his shoes and the cut on his hand. She can tell he is not answering honestly, and after a time  asks no more questions.\n\nWhile Tony is away, and [[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] happens to be sleeping over at a friend's, [[List of characters from The Sopranos \u2013 friends and family#Father Phillip .22Phil.22 Intintola|Father Phil]] comes round, as he often does. He enjoys Carmela's cooking and the wine, he says, is \"beyond reproach\". [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] phones to reschedule Tony's appointment; Carmela, discovering that Tony's therapist is a woman, assumes that he is sleeping with her. She pours her heart out to Father Phil about her fears for her family and her soul, and then takes [[Eucharist|communion]] with him. She sips the wine; he drains the cup. They fall asleep together on the couch; half-waking, they are about to kiss; Father Phil suddenly desists and walks swaying to the toilet, where he retches. He spends the night on the sofa. In the morning, Carmela firmly says, \"We didn't do anything.\" Tony and Meadow return that day, but his inquiry as to what Carmela was doing all night with another man is turned around when she confronts him about Melfi.\n\n==Deceased==\n'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio|Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio]]''': garroted by Tony Soprano while on Tony's college trip with his daughter, Meadow, for being an FBI informant.\n\n==Title reference==\nThe title refers to the fact that the entire episode revolves around Tony taking Meadow on a tour of colleges in Maine.\n\n==Production==\n* Series creator [[David Chase]] has stated that when HBO first read the script, they objected to Tony's murder of Febby. Executives said that Chase had done so well in building Tony up as a sympathetic character that they believed if Tony committed such a cold-blooded killing, fans would turn on him and the show would lose its protagonist.

During the drive, Tony is taken aback when she asks if he is \"in the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]\", and denies it. When Meadow is skeptical, he admits that a portion of his income is from [[illegal gambling]] and other activities. Meadow admits that she took [[methamphetamine|speed]] to study for [[SAT]]s, but when Tony reacts angrily, will not say where she got it. Both seem relieved by this mutual honesty on difficult topics.\n\nAt a gas station, Tony thinks he spots [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio|Fabian Petrulio]], a former member of the [[DiMeo crime family]] who turned [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant and was relocated under the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]]. Tony resolves to locate and execute Petrulio while continuing his trip with Meadow. He leaves her with some students she has met, and confirms Petrulio's identity when he sees a bust of [[Ronald Reagan]] in his office, similar to those he sculpted while in prison. Petrulio spots Tony and, carrying a handgun, tracks him back to the motel where he and Meadow are staying. However, the presence of two other guests prevents him from taking a shot.\n\nThe next morning, Tony drops off Meadow for an interview. He finds Petrulio at his office, and garrottes him with a length of wire. During the drive later, Meadow asks Tony about the mud on his shoes and the cut on his hand. She can tell he is not answering honestly, and after a time  asks no more questions.\n\nWhile Tony is away, and [[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] happens to be sleeping over at a friend's, [[List of characters from The Sopranos \u2013 friends and family#Father Phillip .22Phil.22 Intintola|Father Phil]] comes round, as he often does. He enjoys Carmela's cooking and the wine, he says, is \"beyond reproach\". [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] phones to reschedule Tony's appointment; Carmela, discovering that Tony's therapist is a woman, assumes that he is sleeping with her. She pours her heart out to Father Phil about her fears for her family and her soul, and then takes [[Eucharist|communion]] with him. She sips the wine; he drains the cup. They fall asleep together on the couch; half-waking, they are about to kiss; Father Phil suddenly desists and walks swaying to the toilet, where he retches. He spends the night on the sofa. In the morning, Carmela firmly says, \"We didn't do anything.\" Tony and Meadow return that day, but his inquiry as to what Carmela was doing all night with another man is turned around when she confronts him about Melfi.\n\n==Deceased==\n'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio|Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio]]''': garroted by Tony Soprano while on Tony's college trip with his daughter, Meadow, for being an FBI informant.\n\n==Title reference==\nThe title refers to the fact that the entire episode revolves around Tony taking Meadow on a tour of colleges in Maine.\n\n==Production==\n* Series creator [[David Chase]] has stated that when HBO first read the script, they objected to Tony's murder of Febby.
