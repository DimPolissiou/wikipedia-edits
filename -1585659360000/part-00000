The band currently consists of [[Aaron Cometbus]] ([[Drum kit|drums]], [[lyrics]]), [[Bill Schneider (musician)|Bill Schneider]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]), [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]) and [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the [[Arcata]] co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many [[dumpster diving]] adventures.\n\n==History==\nPinhead Gunpowder was founded in Arcata, California, in January 1991 by Aaron Cometbus and Jon Quittner. Cometbus wanted the name \"Pinhead Gunpowder\", while Quittner wanted to call it \"50 Foot Hesher\". Along with vocalist Doug \"Douggie Grime\" Rogers and bassist David \"Atlas\" Kimmel, the band played once at a party where Cometbus snapped his bass pedal in half in the middle of the set. Shortly after the show, Cometbus moved back to Berkeley, taking the name of the band and some of the songs with him. Quittner stayed in Arcata with the band and they changed their name to 50 Foot Hesher and acquired a new drummer. A few months later, Quittner left the band and the remaining members changed the name to \"Lank\". \n\nBack in Berkeley, Cometbus formed the second incarnation of Pinhead Gunpowder with Bill Schneider and Sarah Kirsch of The Skinflutes, and Billie Joe Armstrong of [[Green Day]]. In June 1991 they recorded their first EP, ''Tr\u00fcndle and Spring''. It was not until April of the following year that the band played their first live show at Punks With Presses in Oakland along with Rancid and The Gr'Ups. The band then released their second EP, ''Fahizah''. In 1993, Kirsch left the band citing personal differences with Armstrong's decision to sign to a major label with Green Day.  Kirsch was replaced by Jason White of Chino Horde. Shortly after, the band embarked on a week long tour of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington in the winter of 1994.\n\n==Current==\nPinhead Gunpowder performed for the first time in many years during February 2008, debuting three new songs, \"Anniversary Song\", \"West Side Highway\", and \"On the Ave\" .\n\nThe band released their latest EP, ''[[Pinhead Gunpowder (2008 EP)|West Side Highway]]'' through [[Recess Records]] on August 19, 2008. This marked the band's first new release in 5 years.\n\nPinhead Gunpowder released a greatest hits album called ''[[Kick Over the Traces]]'' on June 19, 2009. Also, Pinhead Gunpowder mentioned that in August or September Recess would re-release on vinyl and CD the albums ''[[Jump Salty]]'', ''[[Carry the Banner]]'', ''[[Goodbye Ellston Avenue]]'', ''[[Shoot the Moon (EP)|Shoot the Moon]]'' and ''[[Compulsive Disclosure]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greendayauthority.com/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1233810000&archive= |title=Green Day Authority |publisher=Green Day Authority |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> All of the albums were re-released in assorted colors in early February 2010 through Recess Records, but quickly recalled and destroyed at the request of the band.

During Pinhead Gunpowder's first incarnation, Cometbus and Quittner wrote a handful of songs together, including \"In Control\", \"Losers of the Year\", \"Certain Things\", \"Brother\", \"I Used To\", \"Stab You in the Eye\", and \"Cuidado\" (The last two songs released by Quittner and Cometbus under the band name \"Mundt\"). Cometbus often borrows songs recorded by his other bands to release as Pinhead Gunpowder songs, including \"Train Station\" from Shotwell Coho, \"The Great Divide\" from Redmond Shooting Stars, \"Asheville\" from Cleveland Bound Death Sentence, and \"On the Ave\" and \"Landlords\" from Astrid Oto. Only three Pinhead Gunpowder songs have been written by Billie Joe Armstrong, under the name \"Wilhelm Fink\". Those are \"27\", \"New Blood\", and \"Anniversary Song\". \n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During Pinhead Gunpowder's first incarnation, Cometbus and Quittner wrote a handful of songs together, including \"In Control\", \"Losers of the Year\", \"Certain Things\", \"Brother\", \"I Used To\", \"Stab You in the Eye\", and \"Cuidado\" (The last two songs released by Quittner and Cometbus under the band name \"Mundt\"). Cometbus often borrows songs recorded by his other bands to release as Pinhead Gunpowder songs, including \"Train Station\" from Shotwell Coho, \"The Great Divide\" from Redmond Shooting Stars, \"Asheville\" from Cleveland Bound Death Sentence, and \"On the Ave\" and \"Landlords\" from Astrid Oto. Only three Pinhead Gunpowder songs have been written by Billie Joe Armstrong, under the name \"Wilhelm Fink\". Those are \"27\", \"New Blood\", and \"Anniversary Song\". \n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

subdivisions.<ref>On August 1, 1973 the NCAA's membership was divided into three legislative and competitive divisions at the first special convention ever held. All major schools were reclassified as [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and other schools were divided into [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Roman numerals were chosen to be used rather than the Arabic 1, 2, 3. In 1978, Division I members voted to create subclassifications I-A, I-AA, and I-AAA for the sport of football. The major difference (at this point) besides sponsorship is the amount of scholarships allotted. I-A gets 85, I-AA gets 63, and I-AAA is for institutions that do not sponsor football. Only NCAA Division I is divided into subclassifications and only in the sport of football.</ref><br /> East Tennessee State joins the Southern Conference.<ref name=\"SoConMembers\"/>\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1979 NCAA Division I-A football season|1979]]\n|Chattanooga\n|5\u20131\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1980 NCAA Division I-A football season|1980]]\n|Furman\n|7\u20130\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1981 NCAA Division I-A football season|1981]]\n|Furman\n|5\u20132\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1982 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1982]]\n|Furman\n|6\u20131\n|Southern Conference drops from I-A to the I-AA classification in football.<ref name=\"SoConH\"/>\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1983 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1983]]\n|Furman\n|6\u20130\u20131\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1984 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1984]]\n|Chattanooga\n|5\u20131\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1985 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1985]]\n|Furman\n|6\u20130\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1986 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1986]]\n|[[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]]\n|6\u20130\u20131\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1987 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1987]]\n|Appalachian State\n|7\u20130\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[1988 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1988]]\n|[[1988 Furman Paladins football team|Furman]]<br />[[1988 Marshall Thundering Herd football team|Marshall]]\n|6\u20131\n|Furman wins NCAA Division I-AA [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|national championship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Furman to honor 1988 national champs|author=Willie T.

three legislative and competitive divisions at the first special convention ever held. All major schools were reclassified as [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and other schools were divided into [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Roman numerals were chosen to be used rather than the Arabic 1, 2, 3. In 1978, Division I members voted to create subclassifications I-A, I-AA, and I-AAA for the sport of football. The major difference (at this point) besides sponsorship is the amount of scholarships allotted. I-A gets 85, I-AA gets 63, and I-AAA is for institutions that do not sponsor football.

A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the castle. Eventually, the space between was built on as the town grew and the [[Old Market Square]] became the focus of Nottingham several centuries later.<ref name=\"Scott C.

In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]]. To the north, [[Hucknall]] is controlled by [[Ashfield District Council]], while in the east [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] and [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] form part of the [[Borough of Gedling]]. South of the river, the suburb of [[West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire|West Bridgford]] lies in [[Rushcliffe]], as do the outlying villages of [[Ruddington]] and [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] and the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]].\n[[File:GreaterNottingham-map.png|thumb|Map illustrating the boundaries of the city and the wider [[Greater Nottingham]] area]]\n\n===UK Parliament===\nNottingham has three UK parliamentary [[constituency]] seats within its boundaries.

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim. The ''Trip''<nowiki/>'s current timber building probably dates back to the 17th or 18th century, but the caves are certainly older and may have been used to store beer and water for the castle during medieval times. There are also caves beneath the ''Salutation'' that date back to the medieval period, although they are no longer used as beer cellars. The ''Bell Inn'' is probably the oldest of the three pub buildings still standing, according to [[dendrochronology]], and has medieval cellars that are still used to store beer.<ref name=\"Lomax2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott C.

Nottingham, however, does not have one, having only been designated a city in 1897, in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. In 1884 it became part of the newly created [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham|Diocese of Southwell]], which it, and the city, are still part of today. The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], in the Lace Market, is the oldest and largest. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town. Many of these grand buildings have been demolished, including [[Halifax Place Wesleyan Chapel]], but some have been re-used, notably [[High Pavement Chapel]] which is now a public house. There are three [[Christadelphian]] meeting halls in the city and the national headquarters of the [[Congregational Federation]] is in Nottingham.\n\nNottingham is one of 18 British cities that do not have an Anglican cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/citystatus/index.htm |title=City Status |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043638/http://lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/index.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |title=Cathedrals |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110835/http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is, however, home to the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Barnabas]], which was designed by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1844.

A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the castle. Eventually, the space between was built on as the town grew and the [[Old Market Square]] became the focus of Nottingham several centuries later.<ref name=\"Scott C.

In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]]. To the north, [[Hucknall]] is controlled by [[Ashfield District Council]], while in the east [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] and [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] form part of the [[Borough of Gedling]]. South of the river, the suburb of [[West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire|West Bridgford]] lies in [[Rushcliffe]], as do the outlying villages of [[Ruddington]] and [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] and the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]].\n[[File:GreaterNottingham-map.png|thumb|Map illustrating the boundaries of the city and the wider [[Greater Nottingham]] area]]\n\n===UK Parliament===\nNottingham has three UK parliamentary [[constituency]] seats within its boundaries.

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim. The ''Trip''<nowiki/>'s current timber building probably dates back to the 17th or 18th century, but the caves are certainly older and may have been used to store beer and water for the castle during medieval times. There are also caves beneath the ''Salutation'' that date back to the medieval period, although they are no longer used as beer cellars. The ''Bell Inn'' is probably the oldest of the three pub buildings still standing, according to [[dendrochronology]], and has medieval cellars that are still used to store beer.<ref name=\"Lomax2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott C.

Nottingham, however, does not have one, having only been designated a city in 1897, in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. In 1884 it became part of the newly created [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham|Diocese of Southwell]], which it, and the city, are still part of today. The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], in the Lace Market, is the oldest and largest. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town. Many of these grand buildings have been demolished, including [[Halifax Place Wesleyan Chapel]], but some have been re-used, notably [[High Pavement Chapel]] which is now a public house. There are three [[Christadelphian]] meeting halls in the city and the national headquarters of the [[Congregational Federation]] is in Nottingham.\n\nNottingham is one of 18 British cities that do not have an Anglican cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/citystatus/index.htm |title=City Status |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043638/http://lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/index.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |title=Cathedrals |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110835/http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is, however, home to the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Barnabas]], which was designed by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1844.
