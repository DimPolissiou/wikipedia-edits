It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[John C. McGinley]]. The film tells the story of David Mills, a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset to track down a [[serial killer]] who uses the [[seven deadly sins]] as a motif in his murders.\n\nThe screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in [[New York City]] trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in [[Los Angeles]], with the last scene filmed near [[Lancaster, California]]. The film's budget was $33 million.\n\nReleased on September 22, 1995 by [[New Line Cinema]], ''Seven'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.<ref name=BOM /> It was well received by critics, who praised the film's dark style, brutality and themes. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], losing to ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nSoon-to-retire detective William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic David Mills, who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy. After forming a friendship with Somerset, Tracy confides to Somerset that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child.\n\nSomerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]]: a man forced to eat until his stomach burst, representing [[gluttony]], and a defense attorney killed after being forced to cut [[a pound of flesh]] from himself, representing [[greed]]. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and [[Child molestation|child molester]], strapped to a bed, emaciated but alive, representing [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. The third victim is in critical condition and in no way would be able to answer any questions asked from Somerset and Mills. Daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance.\n\nThe detectives use library records to identify a [[John Doe]] and track him to his apartment. Doe flees and Mills gives chase, during which Mills falls from a fire escape and injures his arm. Mills searches a truck before being struck in the head with a tire iron. While he is incapacitated, Doe walks up and holds Mills at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe's [[psychopathy]], as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced by Doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed [[Strap-on dildo|strap-on,]] representing [[lust]]. The following day, they attend the scene of a fifth victim, a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured, or commit suicide by taking pills, representing [[pride]].\n\nAs Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.\n\nThe detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location. Within minutes, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver, who has been instructed to bring a box to them. Doe begins to taunt Mills by telling him how envious he was of his life with Tracy. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, warns Mills to stay back. Doe then says that his sin was [[envy]], and that Tracy died as a result of this; he also states that her head is in the box, which is confirmed by Somerset's silence, and that she was pregnant. Despite Somerset's warnings, Mills fatally shoots Doe, completing Doe's plan by representing [[wrath]]. Somerset and the police captain watch while the devastated Mills is taken away. Somerset offers his help for Mills. When the captain asks where he'll be, Somerset simply says, \"Around.\" The ending is left open for discussion as to whether Somerset moves forward with his retirement or decides to remain as a detective.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Detective David Mills\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Detective|Detective Lieutenant]] William Somerset\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Tracy Mills\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[John Doe (Seven)|John Doe]]\n* [[R.

Chechik]] was attached to direct at one point.<ref name=\"Montesano\" /> During pre-production, [[Al Pacino]] was considered for the Detective Somerset role, but he decided to do ''[[City Hall (film)|City Hall]]'' instead. [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] decided to turn down the role of Mills. Washington later regretted turning down the role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Meriah|title=Denzel Washington regrets passing up 'Seven' and 'Michael Clayton'|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo!

[[Christina Applegate]] turned down the role of Tracey.\n\nThe ending of the screenplay, with the head in the box, was originally part of an earlier draft that New Line had rejected, instead opting for an ending that involved more traditional elements of a detective thriller film with more action-oriented elements. But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. At the time, Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making ''[[Alien 3]]''; he said, \"I thought I'd rather die of [[colon cancer]] than do another movie\".<ref name=\"Taubin\">{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}</ref> Fincher eventually agreed to direct ''Seven'' because he was drawn to the script, which he found to be a \"connect-the-dots movie that delivers about inhumanity. It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> He found it more a \"meditation on evil\" rather than a \"police procedural\".\n\nWhen New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, [[Michael De Luca]], met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript | title = David Fincher | first = Mark | last = Salisbury | date = January 18, 2009 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> Despite this, producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.<ref name=\"ending mottham\" /> Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene, noting that his previous film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences, and refusing to do ''Seven'' unless the head-in-the-box scene remained.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\">{{Cite web | url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/16/brad-pitt-gwyneth-head-se7en/ | title = How Brad Pitt fought to keep Gwyneth's head in the box in 'Se7en' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 16, 2011 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | first = Grady | last = Smith }}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot over a long period of 55 days. Fincher approached making ''Seven'' like a \"tiny [[Genre film|genre movie]], the kind of movie [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] might have made after ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.\" He worked with cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', \"how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites.<ref name=\"Montesano\" /> According to the director, \"''Seven'' is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera&nbsp;\u2013 and about what movies are or can be\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" />\n\nThe crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was \"dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible.\" Although the city or state was never mentioned by any of the characters during the film, a sign can be seen in the background of a pizza restaurant called \"New York Pizza\" in which Somerset and Mills visit. The restaurant ironically is located in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. To this end, Fincher turned to production designer [[Arthur Max]] to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. \"We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it\", says Max. \"Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly.\" The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called [[bleach bypass]], wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality.\n\nThe 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\" /> The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio (the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe).<ref name=\"ending mottham\">{{cite book | title = The Sundance Kids: How the Mavericks Took Back Hollywood | first = James | last = Mottham | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn = 978-0-86547-967-8 | pages = 153\u2013155 }}</ref>\n\n=== Title sequence ===\nOriginally, Fincher planned the [[title sequence]] of the film to show Freeman's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city. However, days before a [[test screening]], they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time. Fincher approached [[Kyle Cooper]] to suggest a replacement. Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe's notebooks (created by [[Clive Piercy]] and John Sabel),<ref name=\"artofthetitle2\" /> and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to a remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\". The hand-drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself.<ref name=\"empire title\">{{cite web | url = https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/david-fincher-fight-club-opening-credits/ | title = Anatomy Of An Opening Sequence: David Fincher's Seven | first = Phil | last = de Semlyen | date = October 9, 2015 | accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}</ref>\n\nThe studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that. Fincher instead asked Cooper to \"pretend we've never met and come back and propose something else\", according to Cooper.<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence: \"The idea was that this is John Doe's job: he gets up, makes his books, plans his murders, drinks his tea.\"<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Fincher liked this approach, but cautioned Cooper, \"Well, that would be neat, but that's kind of a 2D glimpse.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[John C. McGinley]]. The film tells the story of David Mills, a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset to track down a [[serial killer]] who uses the [[seven deadly sins]] as a motif in his murders.\n\nThe screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in [[New York City]] trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in [[Los Angeles]], with the last scene filmed near [[Lancaster, California]]. The film's budget was $33 million.\n\nReleased on September 22, 1995 by [[New Line Cinema]], ''Seven'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.<ref name=BOM /> It was well received by critics, who praised the film's dark style, brutality and themes. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], losing to ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nSoon-to-retire detective William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic David Mills, who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy. After forming a friendship with Somerset, Tracy confides to Somerset that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child.\n\nSomerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]]: a man forced to eat until his stomach burst, representing [[gluttony]], and a defense attorney killed after being forced to cut [[a pound of flesh]] from himself, representing [[greed]]. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and [[Child molestation|child molester]], strapped to a bed, emaciated but alive, representing [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. The third victim is in critical condition and in no way would be able to answer any questions asked from Somerset and Mills. Daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance.\n\nThe detectives use library records to identify a [[John Doe]] and track him to his apartment. Doe flees and Mills gives chase, during which Mills falls from a fire escape and injures his arm. Mills searches a truck before being struck in the head with a tire iron. While he is incapacitated, Doe walks up and holds Mills at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe's [[psychopathy]], as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced by Doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed [[Strap-on dildo|strap-on,]] representing [[lust]]. The following day, they attend the scene of a fifth victim, a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured, or commit suicide by taking pills, representing [[pride]].\n\nAs Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.\n\nThe detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location. Within minutes, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver, who has been instructed to bring a box to them. Doe begins to taunt Mills by telling him how envious he was of his life with Tracy. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, warns Mills to stay back. Doe then says that his sin was [[envy]], and that Tracy died as a result of this; he also states that her head is in the box, which is confirmed by Somerset's silence, and that she was pregnant. Despite Somerset's warnings, Mills fatally shoots Doe, completing Doe's plan by representing [[wrath]]. Somerset and the police captain watch while the devastated Mills is taken away. Somerset offers his help for Mills. When the captain asks where he'll be, Somerset simply says, \"Around.\" The ending is left open as to whether Somerset moves forward with his retirement or decides to remain as a detective.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Detective David Mills\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Detective|Detective Lieutenant]] William Somerset\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Tracy Mills\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[John Doe (Seven)|John Doe]]\n* [[R.

[[Denzel Washington]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] decided to turn down the role of Mills. Washington later regretted turning down the role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Meriah|title=Denzel Washington regrets passing up 'Seven' and 'Michael Clayton'|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo!

[[Christina Applegate]] turned down the role of Tracey.\n\nThe ending of the screenplay, with the head in the box, was originally part of an earlier draft that New Line had rejected, instead opting for an ending that involved more traditional elements of a detective thriller film with more action-oriented elements. But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. At the time, Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making ''[[Alien 3]]''; he said, \"I thought I'd rather die of [[colon cancer]] than do another movie\".<ref name=\"Taubin\">{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}</ref> Fincher eventually agreed to direct ''Seven'' because he was drawn to the script, which he found to be a \"connect-the-dots movie that delivers about inhumanity. It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> He found it more a \"meditation on evil\" rather than a \"police procedural\".\n\nWhen New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, [[Michael De Luca]], met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript | title = David Fincher | first = Mark | last = Salisbury | date = January 18, 2009 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> Despite this, producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.<ref name=\"ending mottham\" /> Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene, noting that his previous film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences, and refusing to do ''Seven'' unless the head-in-the-box scene remained.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\">{{Cite web | url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/16/brad-pitt-gwyneth-head-se7en/ | title = How Brad Pitt fought to keep Gwyneth's head in the box in 'Se7en' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 16, 2011 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | first = Grady | last = Smith }}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot over a long period of 55 days. Fincher approached making ''Seven'' like a \"tiny [[Genre film|genre movie]], the kind of movie [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] might have made after ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.\" He worked with cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', \"how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites.<ref name=\"Montesano\" /> According to the director, \"''Seven'' is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera&nbsp;\u2013 and about what movies are or can be\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" />\n\nThe crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was \"dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible.\" Although the city or state was never mentioned by any of the characters during the film, a sign can be seen in the background of a pizza restaurant called \"New York Pizza\" in which Somerset and Mills visit. The restaurant ironically is located in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. To this end, Fincher turned to production designer [[Arthur Max]] to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. \"We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it\", says Max. \"Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly.\" The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called [[bleach bypass]], wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality.\n\nThe 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\" /> The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio (the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe).<ref name=\"ending mottham\">{{cite book | title = The Sundance Kids: How the Mavericks Took Back Hollywood | first = James | last = Mottham | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn = 978-0-86547-967-8 | pages = 153\u2013155 }}</ref>\n\n=== Title sequence ===\nOriginally, Fincher planned the [[title sequence]] of the film to show Freeman's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city. However, days before a [[test screening]], they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time. Fincher approached [[Kyle Cooper]] to suggest a replacement. Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe's notebooks (created by [[Clive Piercy]] and John Sabel),<ref name=\"artofthetitle2\" /> and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to a remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\". The hand-drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself.<ref name=\"empire title\">{{cite web | url = https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/david-fincher-fight-club-opening-credits/ | title = Anatomy Of An Opening Sequence: David Fincher's Seven | first = Phil | last = de Semlyen | date = October 9, 2015 | accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}</ref>\n\nThe studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that. Fincher instead asked Cooper to \"pretend we've never met and come back and propose something else\", according to Cooper.<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence: \"The idea was that this is John Doe's job: he gets up, makes his books, plans his murders, drinks his tea.\"<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Fincher liked this approach, but cautioned Cooper, \"Well, that would be neat, but that's kind of a 2D glimpse.

All seven issues were collected in trade paperback form, released on January 15, 2008, as ''[[Seven (comic book)|SE7EN]]'', edited by David Seidman and Ralph Tedesco.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=7216 Comic Book Resources.com Horrific sins: ''SE7EN\" comes to comics this September]</ref><ref>[http://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=660931 MyComicShop: Seven (2006 Se7en) comic books]</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe opening credit music is a spliced sample of an uncredited remix of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\", available as \"Closer (Precursor)\", remixed by [[Coil (band)|Coil]], on the \"Closer\" single. The song during the end credits is [[David Bowie]]'s song \"[[The Hearts Filthy Lesson]]\", found on his album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]''. The film's original score is by [[Howard Shore]]. The soundtrack was released in 1995 by [[TVT Records]] in conjunction with the movie.
