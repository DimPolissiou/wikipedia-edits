It is a follow up to the 2011 feature film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', and is the fourth [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] short film. The film is directed by Louis D'Esposito from a screenplay by [[Eric Pearson]], and stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as Carter, along with [[Bradley Whitford]] and [[Dominic Cooper]]. In ''Agent Carter'', Peggy Carter sets out on a solo mission to acquire the mysterious [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] while facing sexism post-World War II at the SSR, a precursor to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n\nA Marvel One-Shot featuring Peggy Carter was in the works for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the ''Captain America'' films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of [[Howard Stark]].\n\nThe short was released on the home media release of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and was received positively by critics and the audience from an earlier screening at [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. It won a [[Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Golden Reel Award]]. This response led to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ordering a television series expansion of the short; ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Marvel's Agent Carter]]'' aired from January 2015 to March 2016, over two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'',<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /> Agent [[Peggy Carter]] is now a member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her compiling data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's main concern is the mysterious [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], which they have been unable to recover for some time.\n\nOne night alone in the office while the men are out together, Carter answers the case line to hear of the location of the Zodiac. Though three to five agents are recommended, Carter decides to go to the location herself. Fighting off multiple guards, Carter is able to retrieve the Zodiac, a mysterious serum, herself. The next day, Flynn reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission, and dismisses the indignant Carter as just an \"old flame\" of [[Captain America]]'s who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. However, before he can officially punish her, the case line rings again, this time with [[Howard Stark]] on the other end, who informs Flynn that Carter will co-head the newly created [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], [[Dum Dum Dugan]] is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created [[bikini]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Hayley Atwell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Production on the short began when Hayley Atwell agreed to reprise her role from ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.]]\n\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]]: <br />An SSR agent forced to work in data analysis and code breaking since the end of World War II,<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/> Carter reprises her role from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. On the character starring in her own short film, director [[Louis D'Esposito]] said that Marvel always wanted to do a Peggy Carter short since the character \"was a fan-favorite and a [[Marvel Studios]] favorite\". D'Esposito enjoyed the moment when Carter uses her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] to view the bad guy, which was [[Ad libitum|ad libbed]] during filming, because \"that's the essence of what she's about and what the film's about. Not only is she\u2014especially in that time\u2014a woman in a man's world, she still maintains her femininity\".<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" />\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as John Flynn: Carter's SSR boss.<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" /><ref name=\"JohnFlynn\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]: <br />The co-head and -founder of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]],<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/> Cooper reprises his role from ''Captain America: The First Avenger''. In the short, as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]], Stark is seen wearing the same robe that his son [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony]] wears in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" />\n\n[[Neal McDonough]] reprises his role of [[Dum Dum Dugan|Timothy \"Dum Dum\" Dugan]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]], and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] appears as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] via archive footage from ''The First Avenger''. [[Shane Black]], director and co-writer of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', voices the \"Disembodied Voice\", the caller on the other end of the case line.<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn August 2011, [[Marvel Studios]] announced that a couple of short films would be released [[direct-to-video]],<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> which were designed to be self-contained stories and known as [[Marvel One-Shots]].<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\"<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> One of the ideas developed as a potential One-Shot was a spin-off from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', following the story of [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of that film. The idea was looked at again when Marvel was deciding on a short film to produce for the home media release of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013, and it was chosen for the spot, dependent on actress [[Hayley Atwell]]'s availability.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\nMarvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, who directed the previous One-Shot, ''[[Item 47]]'', returned as director,<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /><ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> while writer [[Eric Pearson]] also returned from the previous One-Shots.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /><ref name=\"Variety\" /> D'Esposito noted that the short had twice the budget of ''Item 47'', but the same amount of shooting time so \"the scope of it is much bigger. It's set in a period, there are more actors involved, the scale's bigger, there are three fight scenes\u2014we've never had that in any of [the previous One-Shots].\"<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> Atwell agreed to the project after watching ''Item 47'', and due to her love for the character and potential \"to show off some of her skill sets\" that were not seen in the film. Atwell worked for three days with the stunt team to rehearse the pre-choreographed fight sequences for the short.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> D'Esposito elaborated on the decision to focus on Carter, saying, \"It's telling the best story, and finding that story we want to tell\u2014whether it's connectivity to the Marvel Universe, or it's highlighting a character. In the case of Hayley, it's a little bit of both. We wanted to tell Peggy Carter's story\u2014she's been left back in the '40s. Announcing to the world that she was running S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark is a great connectivity.\"<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" />\n\n===Filming===\n''Agent Carter'' was filmed over five days,<ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> with Gabriel Beristain serving as [[cinematographer]]. The budget did not allow for a storyboard artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> The mid-credits scene with [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]] was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when it was found that the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" />\n\nD'Esposito chose to differentiate the short from ''The First Avenger'' by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director [[Joe Johnston]], instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) that gave the short some \"better\" lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a [[Steadicam]] or a [[camera dolly]] for the action sequences, to avoid a \"quick cutty or blurry or shaky\" feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately \"pushing our limit\" to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he \"wasn't going to get every shot and I wasn't going to get every punch and kick, so what we do is get the optimum\".<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nVisual effects shots of 1940s New York from ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' were reused in the short for budgetary reasons.<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> D'Esposito noted the sequence where Carter comes \"flying with the gun into the door\" and the last fight, when Carter is \"being attacked by the big guy\", were both created with visual effects elements after they ran out of time to complete filming on them on set.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> In early 2013, Marvel approached visual effects company Perception to create the main-on-end [[title sequence]] for the short. Visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal was told to retell the story of the short in 90 seconds, so she decided to use stylized versions of imagery from the period and the short itself. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation was used to achieve a final 2D look.<ref name=\"Perception\" />\n\n==Music==\nComposer [[Christopher Lennertz]], who previously collaborated with D'Esposito on the One-Shot ''Item 47'', composed the music for ''Agent Carter''.<ref name=\"Lennertz\" /> Like the rest of the short, D'Esposito wanted the music to reflect the period setting, but to have a modern feel to it as well, so he sent Lennertz [[Johnny Rivers]]' \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" as a reference track, despite it having been released in the 1960s, since it had the feel and sentiment D'Esposito was looking for.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Agent Carter'' was first shown in full at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/> It was then released on the ''Iron Man 3'' home media, first on September 3, 2013 in [[Digital distribution|digital download]] form, and then on [[Blu-ray disc]] and [[3D Blu-ray]] on September 24, 2013.<ref name=\"HomeMedia\" /><ref name=\"Variety\" /> D'Esposito said that it was decided to release the short along with ''Iron Man 3'' because \"the time was right\", with the ''Iron Man 3'' home media being released before the opening of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' in theaters.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /> It is also included on the bonus-disc of the \"[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]\" [[box set]], which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other [[Marvel One-Shots]]. The collection features audio commentary from D'Esposito and Atwell, and was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nRosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' noted that the short was well received by the audience at Comic Con, and praised Atwell's performance. She said the short \"looks great and packs some euphoric action moments\".<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" /> Andy Hunsaker at Crave Online gave the short a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it a fun treat that \"gives its title character the send-off she deserves\", and hoping that it would lead to further female-focused properties from Marvel.<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> [[IGN]]'s Scott Collura called Atwell \"the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\" He felt the short seemed more of a proof-of-concept that female-based superhero projects could work, but that \"Atwell never loses touch with her feminine side\" either.<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" />\n\nThe Movie Ramblings review of the short highlighted its \"short, sharp and witty script mixed with some equally sharp action\" and D'Esposito's direction, naming it the best Marvel One-Shot at that point.<ref name=\"MovieRamblings\" /> Flickering Myth called the short \"a great effort. A nice, compact story that gives us a lot of great moments with the character.\" The reviewer felt Flynn made a \"great foil\" to Carter, and also noted the \"great cameos and a post credit scene that should put a smile on everybody's face....''Agent Carter'' is another great Marvel offering that shows how committed they are to the idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine.\"<ref name=\"FlickeringMyth\" />\n\nThe short won the [[Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Golden Reel Award]] for Best Sound & Music Editing: Direct to Video \u2013 Live Action.<ref name=\"GoldenReel\" />\n\n==Television series==\n{{main|Agent Carter (TV series)}}\n''Marvel's Agent Carter'', a television series inspired by the short film also starring Hayley Atwell as

It is a follow up to the 2011 feature film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', and is the fourth [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] short film. The film is directed by Louis D'Esposito from a screenplay by [[Eric Pearson]], and stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as Carter, along with [[Bradley Whitford]] and [[Dominic Cooper]]. In ''Agent Carter'', Peggy Carter sets out on a solo mission to acquire the mysterious [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] while facing sexism post-World War II at the SSR, a precursor to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n\nA Marvel One-Shot featuring Peggy Carter was in the works for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the ''Captain America'' films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of [[Howard Stark]].\n\nThe short was released on the home media release of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and was received positively by critics and the audience from an earlier screening at [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. It won a [[Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Golden Reel Award]]. This response led to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ordering a television series expansion of the short; ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Marvel's Agent Carter]]'' aired from January 2015 to March 2016, over two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'',<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /> Agent [[Peggy Carter]] is now a member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her compiling data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's main concern is the mysterious [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], which they have been unable to recover for some time.\n\nOne night alone in the office while the men are out together, Carter answers the case line to hear of the location of the Zodiac. Though three to five agents are recommended, Carter decides to go to the location herself. Fighting off multiple guards, Carter is able to retrieve the Zodiac, a mysterious serum, herself. The next day, Flynn reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission, and dismisses the indignant Carter as just an \"old flame\" of [[Captain America]]'s who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. However, before he can officially punish her, the case line rings again, this time with [[Howard Stark]] on the other end, who informs Flynn that Carter will co-head the newly created [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], [[Dum Dum Dugan]] is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created [[bikini]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Hayley Atwell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Production on the short began when Hayley Atwell agreed to reprise her role from ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.]]\n\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]]: <br />An SSR agent forced to work in data analysis and code breaking since the end of World War II,<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/> Carter reprises her role from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. On the character starring in her own short film, director [[Louis D'Esposito]] said that Marvel always wanted to do a Peggy Carter short since the character \"was a fan-favorite and a [[Marvel Studios]] favorite\". D'Esposito enjoyed the moment when Carter uses her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] to view the bad guy, which was [[Ad libitum|ad libbed]] during filming, because \"that's the essence of what she's about and what the film's about.

In the short, as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]], Stark is seen wearing the same robe that his son [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony]] wears in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" />\n\n[[Neal McDonough]] reprises his role of [[Dum Dum Dugan|Timothy \"Dum Dum\" Dugan]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]], and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] appears as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] via archive footage from ''The First Avenger''. [[Shane Black]], director and co-writer of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', voices the \"Disembodied Voice\", the caller on the other end of the case line.<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn August 2011, [[Marvel Studios]] announced that a couple of short films would be released [[direct-to-video]],<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> which were designed to be self-contained stories and known as [[Marvel One-Shots]].<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\"<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> One of the ideas developed as a potential One-Shot was a spin-off from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', following the story of [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of that film. The idea was looked at again when Marvel was deciding on a short film to produce for the home media release of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013, and it was chosen for the spot, dependent on actress [[Hayley Atwell]]'s availability.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\nMarvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, who directed the previous One-Shot, ''[[Item 47]]'', returned as director,<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /><ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> while writer [[Eric Pearson]] also returned from the previous One-Shots.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /><ref name=\"Variety\" /> D'Esposito noted that the short had twice the budget of ''Item 47'', but the same amount of shooting time so \"the scope of it is much bigger. It's set in a period, there are more actors involved, the scale's bigger, there are three fight scenes\u2014we've never had that in any of [the previous One-Shots].\"<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> Atwell agreed to the project after watching ''Item 47'', and due to her love for the character and potential \"to show off some of her skill sets\" that were not seen in the film. Atwell worked for three days with the stunt team to rehearse the pre-choreographed fight sequences for the short.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> D'Esposito elaborated on the decision to focus on Carter, saying, \"It's telling the best story, and finding that story we want to tell\u2014whether it's connectivity to the Marvel Universe, or it's highlighting a character. In the case of Hayley, it's a little bit of both. We wanted to tell Peggy Carter's story\u2014she's been left back in the '40s. Announcing to the world that she was running S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark is a great connectivity.\"<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" />\n\n===Filming===\n''Agent Carter'' was filmed over five days,<ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> with Gabriel Beristain serving as [[cinematographer]]. The budget did not allow for a storyboard artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> The mid-credits scene with [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]] was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when it was found that the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" />\n\nD'Esposito chose to differentiate the short from ''The First Avenger'' by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director [[Joe Johnston]], instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) that gave the short some \"better\" lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a [[Steadicam]] or a [[camera dolly]] for the action sequences, to avoid a \"quick cutty or blurry or shaky\" feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately \"pushing our limit\" to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he \"wasn't going to get every shot and I wasn't going to get every punch and kick, so what we do is get the optimum\".<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nVisual effects shots of 1940s New York from ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' were reused in the short for budgetary reasons.<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> D'Esposito noted the sequence where Carter comes \"flying with the gun into the door\" and the last fight, when Carter is \"being attacked by the big guy\", were both created with visual effects elements after they ran out of time to complete filming on them on set.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> In early 2013, Marvel approached visual effects company Perception to create the main-on-end [[title sequence]] for the short. Visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal was told to retell the story of the short in 90 seconds, so she decided to use stylized versions of imagery from the period and the short itself. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation was used to achieve a final 2D look.<ref name=\"Perception\" />\n\n==Music==\nComposer [[Christopher Lennertz]], who previously collaborated with D'Esposito on the One-Shot ''Item 47'', composed the music for ''Agent Carter''.<ref name=\"Lennertz\" /> Like the rest of the short, D'Esposito wanted the music to reflect the period setting, but to have a modern feel to it as well, so he sent Lennertz [[Johnny Rivers]]' \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" as a reference track, despite it having been released in the 1960s, since it had the feel and sentiment D'Esposito was looking for.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Agent Carter'' was first shown in full at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/> It was then released on the ''Iron Man 3'' home media, first on September 3, 2013 in [[Digital distribution|digital download]] form, and then on [[Blu-ray disc]] and [[3D Blu-ray]] on September 24, 2013.<ref name=\"HomeMedia\" /><ref name=\"Variety\" /> D'Esposito said that it was decided to release the short along with ''Iron Man 3'' because \"the time was right\", with the ''Iron Man 3'' home media being released before the opening of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' in theaters.<ref name=\"CBRSDCC\" /> It is also included on the bonus-disc of the \"[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]\" [[box set]], which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other [[Marvel One-Shots]]. The collection features audio commentary from D'Esposito and Atwell, and was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nRosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' noted that the short was well received by the audience at Comic Con, and praised Atwell's performance. She said the short \"looks great and packs some euphoric action moments\".<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" /> Andy Hunsaker at Crave Online gave the short a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it a fun treat that \"gives its title character the send-off she deserves\", and hoping that it would lead to further female-focused properties from Marvel.<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> [[IGN]]'s Scott Collura called Atwell \"the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\" He felt the short seemed more of a proof-of-concept that female-based superhero projects could work, but that \"Atwell never loses touch with her feminine side\" either.<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" />\n\nThe Movie Ramblings review of the short highlighted its \"short, sharp and witty script mixed with some equally sharp action\" and D'Esposito's direction, naming it the best Marvel One-Shot at that point.<ref name=\"MovieRamblings\" /> Flickering Myth called the short \"a great effort. A nice, compact story that gives us a lot of great moments with the character.\" The reviewer felt Flynn made a \"great foil\" to Carter, and also noted the \"great cameos and a post credit scene that should put a smile on everybody's face....''Agent Carter'' is another great Marvel offering that shows how committed they are to the idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine.\"<ref name=\"FlickeringMyth\" />\n\nThe short won the [[Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Golden Reel Award]] for Best Sound & Music Editing: Direct to Video \u2013 Live Action.<ref name=\"GoldenReel\" />\n\n==Television series==\n{{main|Agent Carter (TV series)}}\n''Marvel's Agent Carter'', a television series inspired by the short film also starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter,<ref name=\"CarterTVConfirmed\" /> was ordered by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 8, 2014,<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /> and began its [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]]

RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evira.fi/elaimet/elainlaakaripalvelut/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille/2016/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille-elokuu-2016/rhd-tauti-todettu-myos-lemmikkikaniinissa-erityisluvallista-rokotetta-saatavilla/|title=RHD-tauti todettu my\u00f6s lemmikkikaniinissa - erityisluvallista rokotetta saatavilla|website=Finnish Food Safety Authority (Finnish)|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nTransmission of RHD viruses occurs by direct contact with an infected animal and [[fomite]]s. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evira.fi/elaimet/elainlaakaripalvelut/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille/2016/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille-elokuu-2016/rhd-tauti-todettu-myos-lemmikkikaniinissa-erityisluvallista-rokotetta-saatavilla/|title=RHD-tauti todettu my\u00f6s lemmikkikaniinissa - erityisluvallista rokotetta saatavilla|website=Finnish Food Safety Authority (Finnish)|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nTransmission of RHD viruses occurs by direct contact with an infected animal and [[fomite]]s. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

Walter P. Zeller, its founder, opened his new store & head office at 176 Dundas Street after working for years for Metropolitan Department Stores, F.W. Woolworth Company and Kresges. This new store was to be a part of a chain of Canadian department stores. The plan at the start was to have stores opened in London, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Fort Williams and St. John N.B. The London store had a street frontage of 53 feet and a depth of 137 feet. It had a total of 7,000 square feet of space on the ground floor with 2,000 square feet of counter space spread out around the store. Sixty women were hired for the opening day working in 21 different departments. Within months Zellers was doing such good business that they were bought out by the American firm Schulte-United Ltd. Within two years the rebranded stores went bankrupt. Walter Zeller promptly bought most of the failed Schulte stores and relaunched Zellers in late 1931. Zellers Department Store remained at 176 Dundas Street until the late 1980s.<ref>London Free Press August 3rd, 1928 edition, http://torontoist.com/2015/01/vintage-toronto-ads-zellers/ & http://www.hbcheritage.ca/\u2026/hist\u2026/people/builders/zeller.asp</ref>\n\n===1930s\u20131960s: Early years, partnership with W.T.

Grant to purchase 10% of Zellers shares and eventually a 51% ownership in 1959.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>  In exchange, the Grant Company made available to Zellers its experience in merchandising, real estate, store development, and general administration. Zellers employees were sent to Grant stores and head office for training and the two companies made common buying trips to east Asia.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> In the 1950s, the chain again began opening new locations and in 1956, opened its first self-serve location at the [[Norgate shopping centre]] in [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec]].<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> Stores opened in 1960 employed many new innovations, including the first in store restaurant, the first automotive centre and the first suburban location.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>\n\n===1970s\u20131980s: Zellers acquires Fields, HBC acquires Zellers===\nIn 1975, Zellers adopted its final logo. By 1976, Zellers had grown to a chain of 155 stores, with annual sales of $407 million.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>\n\nAlthough Zellers was prospering, W.T. Grant was facing intense competition in the United States, and was forced to withdraw entirely from its Canadian operations. In 1976, [[Fields (department store)|Fields]], a clothing retailer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, offered to purchase a 50.1% stake in Zellers for $32,675,000. Zellers' shareholders, unhappy with the idea of Zellers becoming a subsidiary of Fields, reversed the takeover and purchased Fields and its hardware store division, [[Marshall Wells]]. This sale added 70 Fields stores and 162 franchised Marshall Wells stores to the company. Fields president and founder, Joseph Segal was appointed as president of Zellers.<ref name=\"fields\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/fields |title=HBC Heritage: Fields, The Strength of an Idea |work=Hudson's Bay Company |year=2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1978, Zellers presented a bid to acquire 100% ownership of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC). HBC management, recognizing Zellers profitability and the potential to enter a new retail segment, decided to purchase Zellers instead. Zellers and Fields, operating in very different retail segments from HBC, were kept intact and established as separate divisions of the company. HBC acquired full ownership of Zellers and Fields in 1981 and Marshall Wells in 1982. By 1985, HBC had sold Marshall Wells for $20 million, because it was not relevant to its department store business.\n\nCounterfeit video games for the [[Atari 2600]] were manufactured in Taiwan and sold by Zellers in the 1980s, usually under new names and artwork and occasionally with [[ROM hacking|modified graphics]]. All games were [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] copies of titles created either by [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] itself or by third-party developers, such as [[Activision]]. Zellers was eventually forced by Atari to stop selling these games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512093632/http://retronouveau.tumblr.com/post/17268200307/les-jeux-atari-2600-de-zellers|title=Les jeux Atari 2600 de Zellers|author=Retro Nouveau|publisher=Tumblr|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512093632/http://retronouveau.tumblr.com/post/17268200307/les-jeux-atari-2600-de-zellers|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Sun\">{{cite news | url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/04/03/zellers-reopens-its-doors-in-bells-corners?token=93bac5c80986d88d4baeb7111f167a0e | title=Zellers reopens its doors in Bells Corners | work=[[Ottawa Sun]] | date=3 April 2014 | accessdate=3 April 2014 | author=Desrosiers, Sophie}}</ref> Zellers released 18 games for the Atari 2600 in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = AtariAge - Companies - Zellers\n|url=https://www.atariage.com/company_page.php?SystemID=2600&CompanyID=61\n|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===1990s: Further acquisitions===\nIn 1990, Hudson's Bay Company acquired the 51 stores of the [[Towers Department Stores|Towers/Bonimart]] chain from the [[Oshawa Group]], and converted most of them to Zellers outlets, including its flagship location in [[Toronto]].

During this period, Zellers used the slogan \"the lowest price is the law.\"\n\nIn 1993, Hudson's Bay Company purchased the assets of the bankrupt [[Woodward's]] chain, including 21 store locations.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> These were converted into Zellers and The Bay stores, and greatly expanded the company's presence in Western Canada.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> In 1998, Hudson's Bay Company acquired [[Kmart]]'s Canadian division, and merged it with the Zellers division to create a larger combined chain under the Zellers name.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> While some Kmart locations were closed, many sites became full Zellers outlets.\n\nIn 1996, Hudson's Bay Company closed its Zellers head office in [[Montreal]], Quebec and merged it with the Hudson's Bay Company headquarters in downtown Toronto.

Foote's strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation, but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains. Foote focused on raising profits, even if that meant losing market share and reducing store traffic, by ramping up inventory levels of higher margin goods over loss leaders such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent, and slashing costs. Foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on Facebook. Reportedly, the strategy was paying off as Zellers operating profit was \"well ahead of expectations and the retailer had performed very well in 2011.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail1\"/>\n\nIn March 2012, the first 50 Zellers stores were put in liquidation.

The closings of these stores were to happen at the latest on March 31, 2013 which coincided with the deadline date the HBC had to vacate the sites acquired by Target.

The average store size was 94,000 square feet (8,700 m2). Zellers Select stores were designed for smaller markets with populations under 25,000, with stores averaged 45,000 square feet (4,200 m<sup>2</sup>). Some multi level stores were equipped with a shopping cart system known as the Cartveyor, designed to transport shopping carts between floors next to a standard escalator, while there were few that were so small, they were equipped with elevators open to shoppers, such as with the [[Lawrence Square Shopping Centre]] location in the North York district of Toronto.\n\nIn July 2010, Zellers unveiled prototype store designs in five Winnipeg locations, with two more originally planned for late 2010 and early 2011. One store opened on the lower floor of the downtown Winnipeg Bay store making it the first Bay Zellers hybrid store in the HBC family of stores.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Restaurant===\n'''The Skillet''', Zellers in-store restaurant brand, launched in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chapin|first1=Angelina|title=The Ode: Zellers (1931 - 2011) - Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lifestyle/the-ode-zellers-1931-2011/|website=Canadian Business|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=January 14, 2011|quote=In 1960, Zellers opened its first in-store restaurant, The Skillet, as well as an auto-centre, and its first store in a suburban mall.}}</ref> The restaurants underwent several revisions and were branded as '''Zellers Family Restaurant''' before their demise.\n\n===Pharmacy===\nAlmost every Zellers location had a pharmacy in it with a few stores in Quebec also having them. Prescription records were sold to other pharmacies in 2011 and Zellers pharmacies ceased operation throughout 2012. Zellers was subject to controversy regarding its sale of patient records.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Liquidation centres===\nAlthough Zellers remained open until 2020 as a store liquidator for [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[Home Outfitters]], the Zellers chain had also operated a few liquidation centres for its own merchandise. Those were typically former regular Zellers stores that had been converted as liquidation centres for a limited time before closing down for good. The Zellers Family restaurants continued operating in these liquidation centres.\n\n==Products==\nProducts sold at Zellers included clothing, grocery, toys, electronics, furniture, and home supplies.\n\n===Grocery===\nAll Zellers sold basic groceries such as dry snacks and other prepackaged foods. The Neighbourhood Market, which used to be available at some locations, was Zellers expanded section of grocery items, which included frozen and dairy aisles. Prototype stores in Winnipeg featured full grocery departments including fresh produce and baked goods. Such plans were dropped following Target Canada's acquisition of many Zellers leases. Some stores removed their The Neighbourhood Market section.\n\n===Exclusive labels===\nZellers carried many of its own labels and also had exclusive rights in Canada to some other labels:\n<!--Please do not add labels that are found outside of Zellers/Target-->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Alfred Sung]] Home\n* Beaumark\n* Big Star\n* Big Z {{small|(pillows)}}\n* Home Studio\n* Homestyles\n* Hunt Club\n* Marketsquare\n* Midtown\n* Nest by House & Home\n* Request {{small|(promoted by [[Ashlee Simpson]])}}\n* Sportek {{small|(unrelated to [[Sport Chek]])}}\n* [[Stuff by Hilary Duff]]\n* Truly\n* [[X Games]]\n* Zeddy {{small|(baby products)}}\n}}\n\n====Acquired labels====\nSome labels exclusive to [[Target Corporation]] in the United States were previously exclusive to Zellers in Canada. After Target's acquisition of Zellers leases until its closure, [[Target Canada]] became the exclusive store for the following brands\n*[[Cherokee Inc.|Cherokee]]\n* [[Mossimo]]\n*[[Wabasso Design Ideas|Wabasso]]\n\nHowever, Target Canada closed in 2015, leaving Wabasso, and Mossimo unavailable in Canada since then. Cherokee was then carried by [[Sears Canada]] for a short period, until it too closed in January 2018. With the demise of Zellers, Target Canada and Sears Canada, none of these brands are carried in Canada.\n\n==Customer service==\nOn January 6, 2012, [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' announced that Zellers received the title of Canada's Worst Customer Service as a department store, based on a survey conducted by CBC with the [[L\u00e9ger Marketing]] research firm in eight metropolitan areas. The retailer refused to be interviewed by ''Marketplace'' host [[Erica Johnson]] regarding its ranking, providing her with a written statement instead. Zellers also did not offer a refund to the mystery shopper who bought a used coffeemaker that was presented as new, and attempted to return the product after the advertised 30 day return period. Zellers Customer Service did not respond to this customer's Twitter message seeking satisfactory resolution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2012-episodes/canadas-worst-customer-service-store-edition |title=Canada's Worst Customer Service |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2015-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105224451/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2012-episodes/canadas-worst-customer-service-store-edition |archivedate=November 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Advertising==\nZellers ran a Festive Finale advertising campaign in late 2011. Zeddy was also used as a mascot to advertise the retailer's toy selection.\n\n===Festive Finale===\nThe Festive Finale campaign was used to advertise Zellers last Christmas and holiday season sale in December 2011. There was a website called Zellers Facebook.ca which allowed customers to vote for their favourite coupon and musical genre. While Zellers recommended that customers have a Facebook account and Like the company, both of these steps were optional. It was also possible to record a radio commercial for Zellers Moonlight Madness sale by using a computer microphone and reading the site's [[teleprompter]]. Zellers also had social networking service accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Festive Finale was criticized for its Boxing Week coupon.\n\n===Loyalty program===\nAs a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] subsidiary, Zellers promoted the [[Hudson's Bay Rewards]] program also available at [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[Home Outfitters]]. It had been known as Club Z and HBC Rewards. The program used a points card, available at no charge but only accepted by Zellers and other partners. A Hudson's Bay MasterCard issued by Capital One is also available, which rewards customers with one point per dollar spent on the card at any retailer. Any Zellers cashier failing to inform a customer about the HBC MasterCard had to give that customer 10,000 HBC points. This is equivalent to 250 Hudson's Bay points, or one eighth of the requirement for a $10 gift card. Hudson's Bay points can still be redeemed for Hudson's Bay gift cards.\n\n===Slogans===\nNumerous slogans were used by Zellers:\n* Early 1980s: The low prices of Zellers are in the news (Zellers low prices are making headlines)\n* 1980s: Only you'll know how little you paid\n* 1980s: Shopping anywhere else is pointless\n* Late 1980s and 1990s Where the lowest price is the law!, followed by Where the lowest price is the law everyday and Because the lowest price is the law. as revisions including a few animated commercials featured Batman and Robin with the villains like the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and the Riddler.\n* 1990s Truly Canadian\n* 1997\u20132000 Better and Better\n* 2000\u20132013 Everything from A to Z\n<!--Please don't add the \"Expect More, Pay Less\" slogan, as it is Target's slogan and Zellers never used it-->\n\n===Zeddy===\n[[File:Zeddy Wheel.ogg|thumb|Zeddy encourages children to ride the Zeddy Wheel attraction at Zellers.]]\nZeddy is a teddy bear mascot used by Zellers all over Canada.

The main purpose of Zeddy was to advertise Toyland, the toy section in Zellers stores. Zellers provided a stuffed Zeddy bear for any child who had a birthday party sponsored by Zellers. There was also a Zellers employee in a giant Zeddy costume hosting the party. Lineup toys of Zeddy were also created.<ref name=\"JasonFinale\">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKs2mh0mY8U | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810010039/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKs2mh0mY8U | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-08-10 | title = Zellers' Festive Finale presents: \"Pick the Playlist\" with Jason the Cashier | publisher = Zellers | accessdate = 2011-11-28}}</ref> In the final months before the last of the Zellers stores were closed permanently, the company distributed a large batch of stuffed Zeddy Bears for sale in stores throughout the network.\n[[File:Zeddy.jpg|thumb|right|195px|A Zeddy Bear, as sold in the chain's last months]]\nMany stores feature a Zeddy Wheel ride, which accommodates one young child on a miniature [[ferris wheel]] type ride. The ride costs $1 and plays carnival music when in use. When no one is riding the wheel, Zeddy says on a regular basis Come ride with me! All aboard the Zeddy Wheel! in an attempt to attract customers.<!--this was included with <ref> tags; updated to comment December 2016: Voice clips and pictures coming soon.-->  Despite Zeddy being withdrawn as Zellers official mascot in 2005, the Zeddy Wheel remained in operation at stores featuring it unless it is out of service, and the voice track was unchanged over the years. Some wheels removed the big Zeddy sticker in favour of multiple, small generic stickers.\n\nZeddy remains used as a baby brand for products such as diapers and baby bath products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zellers.com/content/en/kids/Zeddy/Zeddy.aspx |title=Zeddy |publisher=Zellers |accessdate=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927115252/http://www.zellers.com/content/en/kids/Zeddy/Zeddy.aspx |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Festive Finale campaign in 2011, Zeddy was reintroduced in weekly flyers for Zellers Toyland before closing their stores for Target or Walmart. The character was used as a static picture, but no animated television commercials of him were made during this season. However, some employees decided to wear the Zeddy costume to celebrate the return of this teddy bear. Shortly thereafter, in December 2011, Zellers launched a Zeddy Bucks promotion. Those who spent at least $50 before taxes on toys received a pair of red [[2012 Summer Olympics]] mittens, plus a $10 Zeddy Bucks voucher. This voucher could only be used on a later date.<ref>Zellers December 2011 Flyer.</ref>\n\nWith the last Zellers stores set to close in 2013, the Hudson Bay Company announced in September 2012 that it was looking for a charity organization to adopt Zeddy so that the mascot could live on after Zellers.<ref name=\"Zeddy contest\"/> In a social media ad campaign, ''Zellers Everything Must GO Including Zeddy'', Zeddy was featured in an online video where the mascot was abandoned in the woods by a Zellers executive telling Zeddy that Zellers was liquidating, and everything must go, including him.

At the same time, HBC's new owner [[NRDC Equity Partners]] was focusing on bolstering and re-positioning Zellers' sister chain, [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]], with an upscale and fashion-oriented direction, and saw Zellers as a detriment to the turnaround.\n\nIn January 2011, HBC announced that it would sell the lease agreements for up to 220 Zellers stores to the US. chain [[Target Corporation|Target]] for $1.825 billion. In turn, Target announced its intent to convert many of them to [[Target Canada|Canadian locations of Target]], and re-sell the remainder to other parties such as [[Walmart Canada]], resulting in their liquidation and eventual closure. While HBC retained 64 Zellers locations, it announced on July 26, 2012 that the majority of them would be liquidated and closed by March 31, 2013 due to their lack of profitability. After the chain went under, HBC operated some Zellers-branded locations as liquidation outlets for The Bay, with the last of those stores closed on January 26, 2020.<ref name=\"January 26, 2020\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/zellers-closing-memorabilia-1.5425471|title=As final Zellers stores close, former employees swap memories, memorabilia|last=Watters|first=Haydn|date=January 19, 2020|website=CBC News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nOn Saturday August 4, 1928 Zellers Ltd was born in [[London, Ontario]]. Walter P. Zeller, its founder, opened his new store & head office at 176 Dundas Street after working for years for Metropolitan Department Stores, F.W. Woolworth Company and Kresges. This new store was to be a part of a chain of Canadian department stores. The plan at the start was to have stores opened in London, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Fort Williams and St. John N.B. The London store had a street frontage of 53 feet and a depth of 137 feet. It had a total of 7,000 square feet of space on the ground floor with 2,000 square feet of counter space spread out around the store. Sixty women were hired for the opening day working in 21 different departments. Within months Zellers was doing such good business that they were bought out by the American firm Schulte-United Ltd. Within two years the rebranded stores went bankrupt. Walter Zeller promptly bought most of the failed Schulte stores and relaunched Zellers in late 1931. Zellers Department Store remained at 176 Dundas Street until the late 1980s.<ref>London Free Press August 3rd, 1928 edition, http://torontoist.com/2015/01/vintage-toronto-ads-zellers/ & http://www.hbcheritage.ca/\u2026/hist\u2026/people/builders/zeller.asp</ref>\n\n===1930s\u20131960s: Early years, partnership with W.T.

L. Green Company|Schulte-United]], all of which were in Southern Ontario. Almost immediately, Zellers initiated an aggressive expansion strategy. Within 25 years, Zellers operated 60 stores and employed 3,000 people.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> In 1952, in a move to expand into Atlantic Canada, it acquired the [[Federal Stores]] chain of [[variety store]]s, adding more than 12 new Zellers locations.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>\n\nDuring this period of expansion, Zellers concluded a deal with [[W.T. Grant]], a similar chain of American mass merchandise department stores.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> This arrangement allowed W.T. Grant to purchase 10% of Zellers shares and eventually a 51% ownership in 1959.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>  In exchange, the Grant Company made available to Zellers its experience in merchandising, real estate, store development, and general administration. Zellers employees were sent to Grant stores and head office for training and the two companies made common buying trips to east Asia.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> In the 1950s, the chain again began opening new locations and in 1956, opened its first self-serve location at the [[Norgate shopping centre]] in [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec]].<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> Stores opened in 1960 employed many new innovations, including the first in store restaurant, the first automotive centre and the first suburban location.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/>\n\n===1970s\u20131980s: Zellers acquires Fields, HBC acquires Zellers===\nIn 1975, Zellers adopted its final logo.

Grant was facing intense competition in the United States, and was forced to withdraw entirely from its Canadian operations. In 1976, [[Fields (department store)|Fields]], a clothing retailer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, offered to purchase a 50.1% stake in Zellers for $32,675,000. Zellers' shareholders, unhappy with the idea of Zellers becoming a subsidiary of Fields, reversed the takeover and purchased Fields and its hardware store division, [[Marshall Wells]]. This sale added 70 Fields stores and 162 franchised Marshall Wells stores to the company. Fields president and founder, Joseph Segal was appointed as president of Zellers.<ref name=\"fields\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/fields |title=HBC Heritage: Fields, The Strength of an Idea |work=Hudson's Bay Company |year=2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1978, Zellers presented a bid to acquire 100% ownership of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC). HBC management, recognizing Zellers profitability and the potential to enter a new retail segment, decided to purchase Zellers instead. Zellers and Fields, operating in very different retail segments from HBC, were kept intact and established as separate divisions of the company. HBC acquired full ownership of Zellers and Fields in 1981 and Marshall Wells in 1982. By 1985, HBC had sold Marshall Wells for $20 million, because it was not relevant to its department store business.\n\nCounterfeit video games for the [[Atari 2600]] were manufactured in Taiwan and sold by Zellers in the 1980s, usually under new names and artwork and occasionally with [[ROM hacking|modified graphics]]. All games were [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] copies of titles created either by [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] itself or by third-party developers, such as [[Activision]]. Zellers was eventually forced by Atari to stop selling these games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512093632/http://retronouveau.tumblr.com/post/17268200307/les-jeux-atari-2600-de-zellers|title=Les jeux Atari 2600 de Zellers|author=Retro Nouveau|publisher=Tumblr|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512093632/http://retronouveau.tumblr.com/post/17268200307/les-jeux-atari-2600-de-zellers|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Sun\">{{cite news | url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/04/03/zellers-reopens-its-doors-in-bells-corners?token=93bac5c80986d88d4baeb7111f167a0e | title=Zellers reopens its doors in Bells Corners | work=[[Ottawa Sun]] | date=3 April 2014 | accessdate=3 April 2014 | author=Desrosiers, Sophie}}</ref> Zellers released 18 games for the Atari 2600 in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = AtariAge - Companies - Zellers\n|url=https://www.atariage.com/company_page.php?SystemID=2600&CompanyID=61\n|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===1990s: Further acquisitions===\nIn 1990, Hudson's Bay Company acquired the 51 stores of the [[Towers Department Stores|Towers/Bonimart]] chain from the [[Oshawa Group]], and converted most of them to Zellers outlets, including its flagship location in [[Toronto]].

During this period, Zellers used the slogan \"the lowest price is the law.\"\n\nIn 1993, Hudson's Bay Company purchased the assets of the bankrupt [[Woodward's]] chain, including 21 store locations.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> These were converted into Zellers and The Bay stores, and greatly expanded the company's presence in Western Canada.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> In 1998, Hudson's Bay Company acquired [[Kmart]]'s Canadian division, and merged it with the Zellers division to create a larger combined chain under the Zellers name.<ref name=\"Zellers history\"/> While some Kmart locations were closed, many sites became full Zellers outlets.\n\nIn 1996, Hudson's Bay Company closed its Zellers head office in [[Montreal]], Quebec and merged it with the Hudson's Bay Company headquarters in downtown Toronto.

Foote's strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation, but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains. Foote focused on raising profits, even if that meant losing market share and reducing store traffic, by ramping up inventory levels of higher margin goods over loss leaders such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent, and slashing costs. Foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on Facebook. Reportedly, the strategy was paying off as Zellers operating profit was \"well ahead of expectations and the retailer had performed very well in 2011.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail1\"/>\n\nIn March 2012, the first 50 Zellers stores were put in liquidation.

The closings of these stores were to happen at the latest on March 31, 2013 which coincided with the deadline date the HBC had to vacate the sites acquired by Target.

The average store size was 94,000 square feet (8,700 m2). Zellers Select stores were designed for smaller markets with populations under 25,000, with stores averaged 45,000 square feet (4,200 m<sup>2</sup>). Some multi level stores were equipped with a shopping cart system known as the Cartveyor, designed to transport shopping carts between floors next to a standard escalator, while there were few that were so small, they were equipped with elevators open to shoppers, such as with the [[Lawrence Square Shopping Centre]] location in the North York district of Toronto.\n\nIn July 2010, Zellers unveiled prototype store designs in five Winnipeg locations, with two more originally planned for late 2010 and early 2011. One store opened on the lower floor of the downtown Winnipeg Bay store making it the first Bay Zellers hybrid store in the HBC family of stores.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Restaurant===\n'''The Skillet''', Zellers in-store restaurant brand, launched in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chapin|first1=Angelina|title=The Ode: Zellers (1931 - 2011) - Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lifestyle/the-ode-zellers-1931-2011/|website=Canadian Business|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=January 14, 2011|quote=In 1960, Zellers opened its first in-store restaurant, The Skillet, as well as an auto-centre, and its first store in a suburban mall.}}</ref> The restaurants underwent several revisions and were branded as '''Zellers Family Restaurant''' before their demise.\n\n===Pharmacy===\nAlmost every Zellers location had a pharmacy in it with a few stores in Quebec also having them. Prescription records were sold to other pharmacies in 2011 and Zellers pharmacies ceased operation throughout 2012. Zellers was subject to controversy regarding its sale of patient records.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Liquidation centres===\nAlthough Zellers remained open until 2020 as a store liquidator for [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[Home Outfitters]], the Zellers chain had also operated a few liquidation centres for its own merchandise. Those were typically former regular Zellers stores that had been converted as liquidation centres for a limited time before closing down for good. The Zellers Family restaurants continued operating in these liquidation centres.\n\n==Products==\nProducts sold at Zellers included clothing, grocery, toys, electronics, furniture, and home supplies.\n\n===Grocery===\nAll Zellers sold basic groceries such as dry snacks and other prepackaged foods. The Neighbourhood Market, which used to be available at some locations, was Zellers expanded section of grocery items, which included frozen and dairy aisles. Prototype stores in Winnipeg featured full grocery departments including fresh produce and baked goods. Such plans were dropped following Target Canada's acquisition of many Zellers leases. Some stores removed their The Neighbourhood Market section.\n\n===Exclusive labels===\nZellers carried many of its own labels and also had exclusive rights in Canada to some other labels:\n<!--Please do not add labels that are found outside of Zellers/Target-->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Alfred Sung]] Home\n* Beaumark\n* Big Star\n* Big Z {{small|(pillows)}}\n* Home Studio\n* Homestyles\n* Hunt Club\n* Marketsquare\n* Midtown\n* Nest by House & Home\n* Request {{small|(promoted by [[Ashlee Simpson]])}}\n* Sportek {{small|(unrelated to [[Sport Chek]])}}\n* [[Stuff by Hilary Duff]]\n* Truly\n* [[X Games]]\n* Zeddy {{small|(baby products)}}\n}}\n\n====Acquired labels====\nSome labels exclusive to [[Target Corporation]] in the United States were previously exclusive to Zellers in Canada. After Target's acquisition of Zellers leases until its closure, [[Target Canada]] became the exclusive store for the following brands\n*[[Cherokee Inc.|Cherokee]]\n* [[Mossimo]]\n*[[Wabasso Design Ideas|Wabasso]]\n\nHowever, Target Canada closed in 2015, leaving Wabasso, and Mossimo unavailable in Canada since then. Cherokee was then carried by [[Sears Canada]] for a short period, until it too closed in January 2018. With the demise of Zellers, Target Canada and Sears Canada, none of these brands are carried in Canada.\n\n==Customer service==\nOn January 6, 2012, [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' announced that Zellers received the title of Canada's Worst Customer Service as a department store, based on a survey conducted by CBC with the [[L\u00e9ger Marketing]] research firm in eight metropolitan areas. The retailer refused to be interviewed by ''Marketplace'' host [[Erica Johnson]] regarding its ranking, providing her with a written statement instead. Zellers also did not offer a refund to the mystery shopper who bought a used coffeemaker that was presented as new, and attempted to return the product after the advertised 30 day return period. Zellers Customer Service did not respond to this customer's Twitter message seeking satisfactory resolution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2012-episodes/canadas-worst-customer-service-store-edition |title=Canada's Worst Customer Service |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2015-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105224451/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2012-episodes/canadas-worst-customer-service-store-edition |archivedate=November 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Advertising==\nZellers ran a Festive Finale advertising campaign in late 2011. Zeddy was also used as a mascot to advertise the retailer's toy selection.\n\n===Festive Finale===\nThe Festive Finale campaign was used to advertise Zellers last Christmas and holiday season sale in December 2011. There was a website called Zellers Facebook.ca which allowed customers to vote for their favourite coupon and musical genre. While Zellers recommended that customers have a Facebook account and Like the company, both of these steps were optional. It was also possible to record a radio commercial for Zellers Moonlight Madness sale by using a computer microphone and reading the site's [[teleprompter]]. Zellers also had social networking service accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Festive Finale was criticized for its Boxing Week coupon.\n\n===Loyalty program===\nAs a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] subsidiary, Zellers promoted the [[Hudson's Bay Rewards]] program also available at [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[Home Outfitters]]. It had been known as Club Z and HBC Rewards. The program used a points card, available at no charge but only accepted by Zellers and other partners. A Hudson's Bay MasterCard issued by Capital One is also available, which rewards customers with one point per dollar spent on the card at any retailer. Any Zellers cashier failing to inform a customer about the HBC MasterCard had to give that customer 10,000 HBC points. This is equivalent to 250 Hudson's Bay points, or one eighth of the requirement for a $10 gift card. Hudson's Bay points can still be redeemed for Hudson's Bay gift cards.\n\n===Slogans===\nNumerous slogans were used by Zellers:\n* Early 1980s: The low prices of Zellers are in the news (Zellers low prices are making headlines)\n* 1980s: Only you'll know how little you paid\n* 1980s: Shopping anywhere else is pointless\n* Late 1980s and 1990s Where the lowest price is the law!, followed by Where the lowest price is the law everyday and Because the lowest price is the law. as revisions including a few animated commercials featured Batman and Robin with the villains like the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and the Riddler.\n* 1990s Truly Canadian\n* 1997\u20132000 Better and Better\n* 2000\u20132013 Everything from A to Z\n<!--Please don't add the \"Expect More, Pay Less\" slogan, as it is Target's slogan and Zellers never used it-->\n\n===Zeddy===\n[[File:Zeddy Wheel.ogg|thumb|Zeddy encourages children to ride the Zeddy Wheel attraction at Zellers.]]\nZeddy is a teddy bear mascot used by Zellers all over Canada.

The main purpose of Zeddy was to advertise Toyland, the toy section in Zellers stores. Zellers provided a stuffed Zeddy bear for any child who had a birthday party sponsored by Zellers. There was also a Zellers employee in a giant Zeddy costume hosting the party.

The ride costs $1 and plays carnival music when in use. When no one is riding the wheel, Zeddy says on a regular basis Come ride with me! All aboard the Zeddy Wheel! in an attempt to attract customers.<!--this was included with <ref> tags; updated to comment December 2016: Voice clips and pictures coming soon.-->  Despite Zeddy being withdrawn as Zellers official mascot in 2005, the Zeddy Wheel remained in operation at stores featuring it unless it is out of service, and the voice track was unchanged over the years. Some wheels removed the big Zeddy sticker in favour of multiple, small generic stickers.\n\nZeddy remains used as a baby brand for products such as diapers and baby bath products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zellers.com/content/en/kids/Zeddy/Zeddy.aspx |title=Zeddy |publisher=Zellers |accessdate=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927115252/http://www.zellers.com/content/en/kids/Zeddy/Zeddy.aspx |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Festive Finale campaign in 2011, Zeddy was reintroduced in weekly flyers for Zellers Toyland before closing their stores for Target or Walmart. The character was used as a static picture, but no animated television commercials of him were made during this season. However, some employees decided to wear the Zeddy costume to celebrate the return of this teddy bear. Shortly thereafter, in December 2011, Zellers launched a Zeddy Bucks promotion. Those who spent at least $50 before taxes on toys received a pair of red [[2012 Summer Olympics]] mittens, plus a $10 Zeddy Bucks voucher. This voucher could only be used on a later date.<ref>Zellers December 2011 Flyer.</ref>\n\nWith the last Zellers stores set to close in 2013, the Hudson Bay Company announced in September 2012 that it was looking for a charity organization to adopt Zeddy so that the mascot could live on after Zellers.<ref name=\"Zeddy contest\"/> In a social media ad campaign, ''Zellers Everything Must GO Including Zeddy'', Zeddy was featured in an online video where the mascot was abandoned in the woods by a Zellers executive telling Zeddy that Zellers was liquidating, and everything must go, including him.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Germany", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]] \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and former member of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], to Rome to offer negotiations about a ''Reichskonkordat''. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen. One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing to the concordat, in violation of earlier promises, had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 5 July.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Toland & Atkin.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly before signing the Reichskonkordat on 20 July, Germany signed similar agreements with the major [[Protestant]] churches in Germany.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also.

Pius XI had managed to orchestrate a swelling chorus of Church protests against the racial legislation and the ties that bound Italy to Germany. He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning.

Its vigorous language is in sharp contrast to the involved style in which encyclicals were normally written. The education question was fully and critically examined, and a long section devoted to disproving the Nazi theory of Blood and Soil (Blut und Boden) and the Nazi claim that faith in Germany was equivalent to faith in God. There were scathing references to Rosenberg's ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'' and its neo-paganism. The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'. The document spoke of \"a condition of spiritual oppression in Germany such as has never been seen before\", of 'the open fight against the Confessional schools and the suppression of liberty of choice for those who desire a Catholic education'. 'With pressure veiled and open,' it went on, 'with intimidation, with promises of economic, professional, civil, and other advantages, the attachment of Catholics to the Faith, particularly those in government employment, is exposed to a violence as illegal as it is inhuman.' 'The calvary of the Church': 'The war of annihilation against the Catholic Faith'; 'The cult of idols'. The fulminations thundered down from the pulpits to the delighted congregations.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also. His speeches and conversations were blunt, filled with phrases like 'stupid racialism', 'barbaric Hitlerism'.\"</ref>\n\nGerald Fogarty wrote that \"in the end, the encyclical had little positive effect, and if anything only exacerbated the crisis.\"<ref name=Fogarty>{{cite journal |journal=America |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11288&comments=1 |title=A Pope in Wartime |first=Gerald P. |last=Fogarty |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> The American ambassador reported that it \"had helped the Catholic Church in Germany very little but on the contrary has provoked the Nazi state...to continue its oblique assault upon Catholic institutions.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Frank J.

Pius XI had managed to orchestrate a swelling chorus of Church protests against the racial legislation and the ties that bound Italy to Germany. He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMit brennender Sorge:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Germany"}

Its success was followed by the launch of ''[[Jornal Hoje]]'' (''Today's Journal'') on 21 April 1971, the same day in which its [[Brasilia]] station (TV Globo Bras\u00edlia, Channel 10) was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/bom-dia-brasil/noticia/2011/04/tv-globo-brasilia-completa-40-anos-com-muita-historia-para-contar.html|title=Bom Dia Brasil|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> The program was exclusively shown on the Rede Globo Rio de Janeiro (Channel 4) flagship station until 1974 when it became a nationwide midday newscast.

The programming schedule would later be adapted for regional affiliates with the addition of local news broadcasts on select hours. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when ''Rede Excelsior'' was launched (the process was inherited by ''Rede Globo'' upon Excelsior's closure in 1970). The network's audience share increased in the late 1970s, eventually clinching the top ratings spot of Brazil television. This was the reason Silvio Santos, one of the network's original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 11-year-old program (Programa Silvio Santos, ''The Silvio Santos Program'') to [[Rede Tupi]], while putting up his own network, TVS (now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]]) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. In the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on S\u00e3o Paulo's [[RecordTV]] until 1987, on Rede Tupi until 1980, and on TVS, now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]], until the present day.\n\n[[File:Globo logo 1975.svg|150px|thumb|right|The ''Rede Globo'' logo used from 18 July 1975 until 2 September 1983]]\n''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network's morning news program, ''Bom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo'' (Good Morning S\u00e3o Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1975 would also be the first time its present corporate logo was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was then a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network's first presentation package with the new corporate logo for the first time with the help of New York-based Dolphin Productions - making Globo the first national network to use the [[Scanimate]] system of computer animation and the second TV station in Brazil to adopt it after TVS in Rio de Janeiro, the first TV channel to use the system in 1976. That year also marked the premiere of ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (1977 TV series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), one of the network's famous children's series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007 (both were live-action ones) and from April 2007, it has an animated version as well but the 2000 logo version of ''Globo'' that they used turned out to be their last.\n\nThe network's second successful FIFA World Cup telecast after its first ([[FIFA World Cup 1978]]) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of ''Globo Esporte'' (''Globo Sports''), the network's daily sports newscast, still airing before ''Jornal Hoje'', then anchored by Luciano do Valle. That same year, ''Caso Especial'' ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, ''Aplauso''. The decade closed with the premiere of the ''Domingo Maior'' (Best Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, the ''Cinema Especial'' holiday film specials, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the ''Jornal das Sete'' (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979-83, precursor to the network's local news programs of today. ''Jornal da Globo'' was anchored by Sergio Chapelin at the time and aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes. ''Domingo Global'', the musical program showcasting both Brazilian and international music, also made its debut.\n\n=== At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980\u201390) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAs ''Rede Globo'' marked its 15th years of broadcasts in 1980\u201381, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that [[Rede Tupi]] shut down all of its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15th Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the ''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television.\n\n''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'' (''It's Worth Watching Once Again''), an afternoon drama block, debuted on 5 May that year. ''Globo Rural'', its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays. Another debut program was the woman-oriented ''TV Mulher''.\n\n==== More surprises and shows ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1981 saw the debut of the top-rating comedy program ''Viva O Gordo'' with J\u00f4 Soares at the helm, one of the network's many mainstay comedies of the decade. Aside from its [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] coverage in 1982, the network premiered the children's show ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' (''Magic Balloon''), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children's musical group [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], whose music struck a chord with its viewers. 1982 saw the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.\n\n1983 saw the birth of another network hit: [[V\u00eddeo Show]], successfully airing until 2019. Its first program host was T\u00e1ssia Camargo. The network's daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983\u201394), it gives an inside look of the network's programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo's historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program's early co-hosts. It had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Arag\u00e3o of ''Os Trapalh\u00f5es'', lasting until 1986. Another success was the top-rating drama ''Guerra Dos Sexos'' in the evening slots.\n\nAlso debuting that year were the ''Pra\u00e7a TV'' local newscasts (the names of the program were different depending on the state or locality it was transmitted to; ''RJ TV'', ''SP TV'', ''MG TV'', ''ES TV'', ''DF TV'', ''BA TV'', ''Paran\u00e1 TV''), aired twice a day and the national version of the network's S\u00e3o Paulo morning newscast, ''Bom Dia Brasil'' (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo's Bras\u00edlia studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcast in full then in Globo's Recife, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte stations because S\u00e3o Paulo (1977\u2013) and Rio de Janeiro (1983\u201384 and 1989\u2013) had their own local editions (Bom Dia Pra\u00e7a) of the newscast.\n\nIn 1984, it not only premiered its ''Supercine'' film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended Pra\u00e7a TV to late night as a result of the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute ''Pra\u00e7a TV Terceira Edi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Pra\u00e7a TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day's local news in their own networks after ''Jornal da Globo'' was aired. By then, Eliakim Araujo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and had J\u00f4 Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was ''Pra\u00e7a TV Sunday Editions'', lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as Fantastico's preview show in the midday and early evening editions. It was also the year of the [[Diretas J\u00e1]] (Direct Elections (for president) Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which ''Jornal Nacional'' had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign's progress.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== 1985\u201389: Globo at 20, countdown to 25 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1985 was Globo's 20th anniversary. It was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One reason was the ''Festival 20 Anos'' (''20 Years Festival'') showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of ''[[Roque Santeiro]]'', then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on ''Rede Globo'' newer than its planned previous edition, and the debut of ''Coruj\u00e3o'', its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country's military rule of 21 years. Since it is the last program before sign-off except for some days of the week, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network's sign-off plug, showing the next day's programming. SOS Nordeste Urgente ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' (''Children's Hope'') charity telethon, to be aired the next year.\n\nIn 1986, Editora Globo, the Globo publishing house, was established. It holds 10% of the Brazilian magazine market, Brazil\u2019s second largest [[publisher]] leading in several segments of the market.<ref>56.\tNeto, R. de G. (1997). Case Study: TV Globo--The Brazilian Media Giant.\u00a0International Executive,\u00a039(2), 255\u2013269.\u00a0\n</ref>\n\n1986 was the key year when [[Xuxa Meneghel]]'s own show, ''[[Xou da Xuxa]]'' (''Xuxa's Show'') debuted on Rede Globo. Xuxa, who left the similarly formatted program ''Clube da Crian\u00e7a'' on ''[[Rede Manchete]]'', joined the network and thus, her show replaced the successful ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' as a result. It was a hit among children in all the country, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1992. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os Trapalh\u00f5es, which lasted until 1987. The network's other big program was its coverage of the [[1986 Copa Ouro]], plus the first telecast of the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' children's charity show, which Renato Arag\u00e3o (of Os Trapalh\u00f5es) hosted. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed. 1987 saw yet more improved programming debut in all areas. In 1988, ''[[Vale Tudo (telenovela)|Vale Tudo]]'', one of Brazilian television's best dramas, premiered on the channel followed by its ''Tela Quente'' (''Hot Screen'') weekly film block, aired on Mondays.\n\nOn 26 March 1989, the network's own Sunday variety program, ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]'' (''Faust\u00e3o's Big-Sunday''), was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT's ''Programa Silvio Santos''. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before ''Fant\u00e1stico''. Another newcomer was the ''Sessao M\u00e1xima'' film block, airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally airing on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Pra\u00e7a TV in the local level.\n\nEven ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' and ''[[Jornal da Globo]]'' got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of ''The Fuzz'' plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by [[William Bonner (newscaster)|William Bonner]] and [[F\u00e1tima Bernardes]] (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to ''Jornal Hoje''), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined ''Fant\u00e1stico'' along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as ''Jornal Hoje'' principal anchor (replacing Cordeiro) and joined ''Jornal Nacional'' as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with ''Fant\u00e1stico'' until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila's own wedding. The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo's 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their years-end campaign video commemorating its 25th anniversary, in which most of the network's artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme song. In 1990, Globo turned 25 years old. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (''25 Years Festival'') of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:\n\n* ''Escolinha do Professor Raimundo'' (weekday afternoons)\n* ''Araponga''\n* ''A Rainha da Sucata''\n\nTV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to [[Rede Manchete]]'s ''[[Pantanal]]'' drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening, and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] that same year, and covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== 1991\u20131992: The countdown to 30 years and Globosat Networks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1991 saw the birth of ''Globosat'', the Globo Organization's own cable service, of which ''Rede Globo'' was but part. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 30 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of ''O Dono do Mundo'', another of its top record dramas, plus ''Vamp'', its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a South American hit. Plant\u00e3o JN, Globo's own breaking news service was relaunched into ''Plant\u00e3o da Globo'' that year, and Fausto Silva began hosting his own New Year's program. Globo became the official network for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when it made its national premiere. Its 6:00 soap opera, ''Felicidade'', marked yet another first for the network because it had a woman director, Denise Saraceni, for the first time in national television drama history.\n\nBy the next year, President Collor's impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo's news and sports teams. {{clarify span|On 31 December 1992, Globo lost this franchise with a closing ceremony the programme closed and the Globo ident has Ended, the anthropomorphic puppet hosted show that continued the network's long successes with child-friendly programming.

It would be also a great year for its drama and news departments. However, May Day celebrations that year were marred by the sudden death that same day of the nation's [[Formula One]] hero, [[Ayrton Senna]], during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]]. As the official F1 broadcaster, it brought the sad news of his demise to the nation and covered its aftermath with special coverages and the huge national mourning for his sudden loss.\n\n=== 1995\u20131999: Into the 21st century and the 5th century of Brazil ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n''Globo'' turned 30 on 1 January 1995. The highlights of the year included the opening of the brand new [[Est\u00fadios Globo]] studios and the launch of a new youth oriented program: [[Malha\u00e7\u00e3o]], plus its Festival 30 Anos (30 Years Festival) commemorative series. It was the year that Os Trapalh\u00f5es ended a long successful run on the network, and the Plim Plim interval idents{{Clarify|date=July 2015}} were updated by various cartoonists for the anniversary. ''Globo'' suffered a year of audience losses but in 1996 audience share began to increase until they were the nation's number one network, aided by brand new programs (among them were the telenovela ''O Rei do Gado'' and the very popular sitcom ''Sai de Baixo'') and its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, coupled with changes in the newsrooms. ''Globo'' was the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, ''[[Globo News]]'', which started in the same year. Now based in both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the latter the main headquarters, it broadcast replays of ''Globo'' news programs, and had its own news programs and commentaries. The network ratings were threatened by the top rated programming from SBT and Record, but in 1998 the network recovered its top place with its 1998 FIFA World Cup live coverage, although violent images became an issue when its 9 P.M. telenovela Torre de Babel was pulled off the air. Holiday programming was boosted by its New Year's Eve premiere of ''Show da Virada'', Aloysio Legey's creation and Brazil's response to international New Year television celebrations worldwide. That year was also the start of its ground breaking Brazil 500 project aimed at preparing the nation for its 500th anniversary of European discovery.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n''Globo'' has since expanded to become the largest TV Network in Brazil, with over $2 billion in revenue in 1992.<ref name=\"Helena Sousa\">{{Cite news|last=Sousa|first=Helena|title=The re-export of the US commercial television model|pages=1\u201315|publisher=Minho University|date=July 1998|url=http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/sousa-helena-globo-sic.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000: Globo at the beginning of the New Millennium and the golden year of Brazilian Television ===\n2000, the 35th anniversary of Globo, the 50th of Brazilian Television and the 500th for Brazil, was highlighted by its ''TV Ano 50'' series honoring the first five decades of Brazilian television, and the Brazil 500 festival concert, the launch of three brand new variety shows (the Saturday afternoon hit Caldeir\u00e3o do Huck, the late weeknight Programa do J\u00f4 with Jo Soares and Altas Horas, with Serginho Groisman, aired on Sunday midnights), new dramas, and its 2000 Summer Olympics coverage, and was capped off by the Titanic two-part premiere in December as part of Cinema Especial (for the first time in Brazilian TV), another ratings record breaker.

Despite the rising tide of support for Record programs, part of the big triumphs in this anniversary year was the ''Ti Ti Ti'' remake, which was one of the year's top rating dramas (also the first HD soap to be produced and made in this format on the 7&nbsp;pm slot), the first 6&nbsp;pm drama made in HD, ''Araguaia'', and its JN no Ar project on Jornal Nacional, aiming to viewers nationwide with the newscasts visiting various Brazilian cities. 2011, the year ''Globo'' launched its present slogan, saw the historic ''O Clone'' rebroadcast on ''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'', the longest in the historic of that block and a ratings winner in its timeslot. ''Insensato Cora\u00e7\u00e3o'', the first ever drama to be officially declared a ''9 pm Drama'' (''Novela das Nove'') after years of titling them as 8&nbsp;pm soaps, aired with great successes for 8 months that year. Alongside it was the first Globo news program in HDTV, ''Bem Estar'', which debuted that February. April saw the record breaking  ''Cordel Encantado'' debut episode, resulted in it being one of its highest rating 6&nbsp;pm dramas to date and a hit among viewers nationwide. [[Xuxa]] celebrated her silver jubilee on the network with a special TV Xuxa episode that 2 July \u2014 the same day ''Glee'' hit Brazilian TV screens. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n2012 saw Globo become the national channel for its debut season of the national version of [[The Ultimate Fighter]], followed by yet another number one drama at the 9:00pm slot, ''[[Avenida Brasil]]'', as well as the modern reboot of the 1975 drama ''Gabriela''. That April, the network made an historic overnight telecast of [[UFC 146]] in both analogue and high definition to national viewers.\n\nAs the network marked the start of 2015 - its Golden Jubilee - with the unexpected move of Xuxa Meneghel to Record, the celebrations began on 2 January with a special retrospective showing of past miniseries. However, primetime dramas at the 9pm slot were on the losing edge, especially during the second quarter of the year, given the poor standing of ''[[Babil\u00f4nia (TV series)|Babil\u00f4nia]]'' against other networks in its time slot, the lowest ever ratings in recent years for a 9:00 pm drama, but would rebound once  ''[[A Regra do Jogo]]'' premiered on 31 August.

The programming schedule would later be adapted for regional affiliates with the addition of local news broadcasts on select hours. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when ''Rede Excelsior'' was launched (the process was inherited by ''Rede Globo'' upon Excelsior's closure in 1970). The network's audience share increased in the late 1970s, eventually clinching the top ratings spot of Brazil television. This was the reason Silvio Santos, one of the network's original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 11-year-old program (Programa Silvio Santos, ''The Silvio Santos Program'') to [[Rede Tupi]], while putting up his own network, TVS (now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]]) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. In the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on S\u00e3o Paulo's [[RecordTV]] until 1987, on Rede Tupi until 1980, and on TVS, now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]], until the present day.\n\n[[File:Globo logo 1975.svg|150px|thumb|right|The ''Rede Globo'' logo used from 18 July 1975 until 2 September 1983]]\n''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network's morning news program, ''Bom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo'' (Good Morning S\u00e3o Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1975 would also be the first time its present corporate logo was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was then a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network's first presentation package with the new corporate logo for the first time with the help of New York-based Dolphin Productions - making Globo the first national network to use the [[Scanimate]] system of computer animation and the second TV station in Brazil to adopt it after TVS in Rio de Janeiro, the first TV channel to use the system in 1976. That year also marked the premiere of ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (1977 TV series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), one of the network's famous children's series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007 (both were live-action ones) and from April 2007, it has an animated version as well but the 2000 logo version of ''Globo'' that they used turned out to be their last.\n\nThe network's second successful FIFA World Cup telecast after its first ([[FIFA World Cup 1978]]) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of ''Globo Esporte'' (''Globo Sports''), the network's daily sports newscast, still airing before ''Jornal Hoje'', then anchored by Luciano do Valle. That same year, ''Caso Especial'' ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, ''Aplauso''. The decade closed with the premiere of the ''Domingo Maior'' (Best Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, the ''Cinema Especial'' holiday film specials, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the ''Jornal das Sete'' (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979-83, precursor to the network's local news programs of today. ''Jornal da Globo'' was anchored by Sergio Chapelin at the time and aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes. ''Domingo Global'', the musical program showcasting both Brazilian and international music, also made its debut.\n\n=== At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980\u201390) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAs ''Rede Globo'' marked its 15th years of broadcasts in 1980\u201381, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that [[Rede Tupi]] shut down all of its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15th Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the ''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television.\n\n''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'' (''It's Worth Watching Once Again''), an afternoon drama block, debuted on 5 May that year. ''Globo Rural'', its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays. Another debut program was the woman-oriented ''TV Mulher''.\n\n==== More surprises and shows ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1981 saw the debut of the top-rating comedy program ''Viva O Gordo'' with J\u00f4 Soares at the helm, one of the network's many mainstay comedies of the decade. Aside from its [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] coverage in 1982, the network premiered the children's show ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' (''Magic Balloon''), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children's musical group [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], whose music struck a chord with its viewers. 1982 saw the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.\n\n1983 saw the birth of another network hit: [[V\u00eddeo Show]], successfully airing until 2019. Its first program host was T\u00e1ssia Camargo. The network's daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983\u201394), it gives an inside look of the network's programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo's historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program's early co-hosts. It had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Arag\u00e3o of ''Os Trapalh\u00f5es'', lasting until 1986. Another success was the top-rating drama ''Guerra Dos Sexos'' in the evening slots.\n\nAlso debuting that year were the ''Pra\u00e7a TV'' local newscasts (the names of the program were different depending on the state or locality it was transmitted to; ''RJ TV'', ''SP TV'', ''MG TV'', ''ES TV'', ''DF TV'', ''BA TV'', ''Paran\u00e1 TV''), aired twice a day and the national version of the network's S\u00e3o Paulo morning newscast, ''Bom Dia Brasil'' (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo's Bras\u00edlia studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcast in full then in Globo's Recife, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte stations because S\u00e3o Paulo (1977\u2013) and Rio de Janeiro (1983\u201384 and 1989\u2013) had their own local editions (Bom Dia Pra\u00e7a) of the newscast.\n\nIn 1984, it not only premiered its ''Supercine'' film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended Pra\u00e7a TV to late night as a result of the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute ''Pra\u00e7a TV Terceira Edi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Pra\u00e7a TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day's local news in their own networks after ''Jornal da Globo'' was aired. By then, Eliakim Araujo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and had J\u00f4 Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was ''Pra\u00e7a TV Sunday Editions'', lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as Fantastico's preview show in the midday and early evening editions. It was also the year of the [[Diretas J\u00e1]] (Direct Elections (for president) Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which ''Jornal Nacional'' had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign's progress.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== 1985\u201389: Globo at 20, countdown to 25 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1985 was Globo's 20th anniversary. It was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One reason was the ''Festival 20 Anos'' (''20 Years Festival'') showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of ''[[Roque Santeiro]]'', then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on ''Rede Globo'' newer than its planned previous edition, and the debut of ''Coruj\u00e3o'', its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country's military rule of 21 years. Since it is the last program before sign-off except for some days of the week, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network's sign-off plug, showing the next day's programming. SOS Nordeste Urgente ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' (''Children's Hope'') charity telethon, to be aired the next year.\n\nIn 1986, Editora Globo, the Globo publishing house, was established. It holds 10% of the Brazilian magazine market, Brazil\u2019s second largest [[publisher]] leading in several segments of the market.<ref>56.\tNeto, R. de G. (1997). Case Study: TV Globo--The Brazilian Media Giant.\u00a0International Executive,\u00a039(2), 255\u2013269.\u00a0\n</ref>\n\n1986 was the key year when [[Xuxa Meneghel]]'s own show, ''[[Xou da Xuxa]]'' (''Xuxa's Show'') debuted on Rede Globo. Xuxa, who left the similarly formatted program ''Clube da Crian\u00e7a'' on ''[[Rede Manchete]]'', joined the network and thus, her show replaced the successful ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' as a result. It was a hit among children in all the country, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1992. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os Trapalh\u00f5es, which lasted until 1987. The network's other big program was its coverage of the [[1986 Copa Ouro]], plus the first telecast of the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' children's charity show, which Renato Arag\u00e3o (of Os Trapalh\u00f5es) hosted. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed. 1987 saw yet more improved programming debut in all areas. In 1988, ''[[Vale Tudo (telenovela)|Vale Tudo]]'', one of Brazilian television's best dramas, premiered on the channel followed by its ''Tela Quente'' (''Hot Screen'') weekly film block, aired on Mondays.\n\nOn 26 March 1989, the network's own Sunday variety program, ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]'' (''Faust\u00e3o's Big-Sunday''), was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT's ''Programa Silvio Santos''. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before ''Fant\u00e1stico''. Another newcomer was the ''Sessao M\u00e1xima'' film block, airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally airing on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Pra\u00e7a TV in the local level.\n\nEven ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' and ''[[Jornal da Globo]]'' got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of ''The Fuzz'' plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by [[William Bonner (newscaster)|William Bonner]] and [[F\u00e1tima Bernardes]] (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to ''Jornal Hoje''), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined ''Fant\u00e1stico'' along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as ''Jornal Hoje'' principal anchor (replacing Cordeiro) and joined ''Jornal Nacional'' as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with ''Fant\u00e1stico'' until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila's own wedding. The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo's 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their years-end campaign video commemorating its 25th anniversary, in which most of the network's artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme song. In 1990, Globo turned 25 years old. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (''25 Years Festival'') of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:\n\n* ''Escolinha do Professor Raimundo'' (weekday afternoons)\n* ''Araponga''\n* ''A Rainha da Sucata''\n\nTV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to [[Rede Manchete]]'s ''[[Pantanal]]'' drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening, and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] that same year, and covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== 1991\u20131992: The countdown to 30 years and Globosat Networks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1991 saw the birth of ''Globosat'', the Globo Organization's own cable service, of which ''Rede Globo'' was but part. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 30 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of ''O Dono do Mundo'', another of its top record dramas, plus ''Vamp'', its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a South American hit. Plant\u00e3o JN, Globo's own breaking news service was relaunched into ''Plant\u00e3o da Globo'' that year, and Fausto Silva began hosting his own New Year's program. Globo became the official network for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when it made its national premiere. Its 6:00 soap opera, ''Felicidade'', marked yet another first for the network because it had a woman director, Denise Saraceni, for the first time in national television drama history.\n\nBy the next year, President Collor's impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo's news and sports teams. {{clarify span|On 31 December 1992, Globo lost this franchise with a closing ceremony the programme closed and the Globo ident has Ended, the anthropomorphic puppet hosted show that continued the network's long successes with child-friendly programming.

It would be also a great year for its drama and news departments. However, May Day celebrations that year were marred by the sudden death that same day of the nation's [[Formula One]] hero, [[Ayrton Senna]], during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]]. As the official F1 broadcaster, it brought the sad news of his demise to the nation and covered its aftermath with special coverages and the huge national mourning for his sudden loss.\n\n=== 1995\u20131999: Into the 21st century and the 5th century of Brazil ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n''Globo'' turned 30 on 1 January 1995. The highlights of the year included the opening of the brand new [[Est\u00fadios Globo]] studios and the launch of a new youth oriented program: [[Malha\u00e7\u00e3o]], plus its Festival 30 Anos (30 Years Festival) commemorative series. It was the year that Os Trapalh\u00f5es ended a long successful run on the network, and the Plim Plim interval idents{{Clarify|date=July 2015}} were updated by various cartoonists for the anniversary. ''Globo'' suffered a year of audience losses but in 1996 audience share began to increase until they were the nation's number one network, aided by brand new programs (among them were the telenovela ''O Rei do Gado'' and the very popular sitcom ''Sai de Baixo'') and its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, coupled with changes in the newsrooms. ''Globo'' was the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, ''[[Globo News]]'', which started in the same year. Now based in both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the latter the main headquarters, it broadcast replays of ''Globo'' news programs, and had its own news programs and commentaries. The network ratings were threatened by the top rated programming from SBT and Record, but in 1998 the network recovered its top place with its 1998 FIFA World Cup live coverage, although violent images became an issue when its 9 P.M. telenovela Torre de Babel was pulled off the air. Holiday programming was boosted by its New Year's Eve premiere of ''Show da Virada'', Aloysio Legey's creation and Brazil's response to international New Year television celebrations worldwide. That year was also the start of its ground breaking Brazil 500 project aimed at preparing the nation for its 500th anniversary of European discovery.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n''Globo'' has since expanded to become the largest TV Network in Brazil, with over $2 billion in revenue in 1992.<ref name=\"Helena Sousa\">{{Cite news|last=Sousa|first=Helena|title=The re-export of the US commercial television model|pages=1\u201315|publisher=Minho University|date=July 1998|url=http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/sousa-helena-globo-sic.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000: Globo at the beginning of the New Millennium and the golden year of Brazilian Television ===\n2000, the 35th anniversary of Globo, the 50th of Brazilian Television and the 500th for Brazil, was highlighted by its ''TV Ano 50'' series honoring the first five decades of Brazilian television, and the Brazil 500 festival concert, the launch of three brand new variety shows (the Saturday afternoon hit Caldeir\u00e3o do Huck, the late weeknight Programa do J\u00f4 with Jo Soares and Altas Horas, with Serginho Groisman, aired on Sunday midnights), new dramas, and its 2000 Summer Olympics coverage, and was capped off by the Titanic two-part premiere in December as part of Cinema Especial (for the first time in Brazilian TV), another ratings record breaker.

Despite the rising tide of support for Record programs, part of the big triumphs in this anniversary year was the ''Ti Ti Ti'' remake, which was one of the year's top rating dramas (also the first HD soap to be produced and made in this format on the 7&nbsp;pm slot), the first 6&nbsp;pm drama made in HD, ''Araguaia'', and its JN no Ar project on Jornal Nacional, aiming to viewers nationwide with the newscasts visiting various Brazilian cities. 2011, the year ''Globo'' launched its present slogan, saw the historic ''O Clone'' rebroadcast on ''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'', the longest in the historic of that block and a ratings winner in its timeslot.

It is used in [[Southeast Asia]]n dishes such as [[laksa]].\n* '''Remouillage''' is a second stock made from the same set of bones.\n\n==Stock versus broth==\n{{Transcluded section|Broth}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Broth|Stock versus Broth}}}}\n\n== Health food claims ==\nBy 2013, \"bone broth\" had become a popular [[health food]] trend, due to the resurgence in popularity of dietary fat over sugar, and interest in \"[[functional food]]s\" to which \"culinary medicinals\" such as [[turmeric]] and [[ginger]] could be added.

They are included as special features in the MCU films' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[digital distribution]] releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. The films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be self-contained stories that provide more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]] set in the MCU.\n\n''The Consultant'' (2011) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011) star [[Clark Gregg]] as Agent [[Phil Coulson]], and offer up self-contained stories about a day in the life of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. ''[[Item 47]]'' (2012) stars [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Jesse Bradford]] as a down-on-their-luck couple who find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun after the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''. ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' (2013) stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', while ''[[All Hail the King]]'' (2014) stars [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]] after the events of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.\n\n==Development==\nIn August 2011, Marvel announced that a couple of short films, designed to be self-contained stories,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> would be released [[direct-to-video]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\" The first two films were made in conjunction with [[Mick Ebeling|The Ebeling Group]] and were directed by Leythum and written by [[Eric Pearson]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Winderbaum added that the name of the shorts program was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> \n\n[[Marvel Studios]] co-president Louis D'Esposito later stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, \"There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] \u2013 and they take off. I could see that happening.\"<ref name=\"Item47\" /> When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that \"We would love to, but it's difficult because there's a cost to that. If [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] is flying around doing something, that [is] very costly. And first of all, what's the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" />\n\nDuring the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' panel at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], D'Esposito stated that bringing the shorts to theaters, to appear before features, was being considered.<ref name=\"Theaters\" /> In May 2014, it was revealed that a One-Shot would not be released with ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''{{'}}s home media,<ref name=\"CapTWS\" /> and in October 2014, it was revealed that ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''{{'}}s home media release would not include one either.<ref name=\"GotG\" /> ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] stated that a One-Shot was not included with the film due to lack of space on the disc.<ref name=\"GunnGotG\" />\n\n==Films==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in [[Harlem]] on [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]. The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] to release Blonsky into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. As [[Nick Fury]] does not want to release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a [[Scapegoat|patsy]] to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends \"The Consultant\": [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. As partially depicted in the post-credits scene of ''The Incredible Hulk'', a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who annoys Ross so much that he tries to have Stark removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.\n\nAt the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced that ''The Consultant'' would appear exclusively on the ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' [[Blu-ray]] release on September 13, 2011.

The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to \"build the audience's relationship [with] him\" before his impactful death. ''The Consultant'' was written after ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'', due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget \"[[Bottle episode|for two guys talking]]\". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in ''Thor'', and had him and Coulson \"brainstorming a way to deal with this [[red tape]] bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative\".<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011){{anchor|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer}}===\nSet before the events of ''Thor'',<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Phil Coulson stops at a gas station on his way to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group.

The One-Shots feature audio commentary, with Gregg providing it for ''The Consultant'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer''; D'Esposito, Hernandez, Welliver, and Bradford on ''Item 47''; D'Esposito and Atwell for ''Agent Carter''; and Pearce and Kingsley with ''All Hail the King''. The collection was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nCindy White of [[IGN]] called ''The Consultant'' \"intriguing\" and said, \"The snappy dialogue seems to fit right in with what we expect from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie.\"<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, \"Considering a third of this is a rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this is a pretty big disappointment.\"<ref name=\"ComingSoonConsultant\" />\n\nR.L. Shaffer of IGN called ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' \"fun\".<ref name=\"IGNHammer\" /> Zachary Scheer of Cinema Blend said, \"The short is as hackneyed as that title. It's about four minutes of Coulson being a badass, if the definition of 'badass' is performing needless slow-motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider \u2013 like which donuts to buy.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendHammer\" />\n\nAndre Dellamorte of Collider called ''Item 47'' \"silly\".<ref name=\"ColliderItem47\" /> William Bibbiani of [[Crave Online]] said, \"The short is largely a success: [Maximiliano] Hernandez, [Jesse] Bradford and [Lizzy] Caplan are all in fine form although, [Titus] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, particularly in regards to Coulson, which doesn't entirely sell.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineItem47\" /> Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, \"[''Item 47''] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that can be attributed to its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to \u2013 we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view.\"<ref name=\"SHHItem47\" />\n\nAndy Hunsaker of Crave Online said, \"''Agent Carter'' is a fun treat which could lead the way for some female-led Marvel films and, if nothing else, it gives its title character the send-off she deserves.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> Scott Collura of IGN said, \"Atwell's Carter is the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\"<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" /> Rosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' said, \"Atwell makes a perfect femme fatale-come-special agent, and this '40s noir-style short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" />\n\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" /> Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==Potential projects==\nIn May 2013, [[DMG Entertainment]] stated they were considering creating a short film, tentatively titled ''The Prologue'', centered on [[Wang Xueqi]]'s character, Dr. Wu, from ''Iron Man 3'', who only appeared in 10 seconds of the film outside of China; Xueqi appeared in three minutes of the Chinese release of the film. ''The Prologue'' would be composed of sequences shot during the production of ''Iron Man 3'' and would elaborate on Wu with the short set before the events of ''Iron Man''. DMG added they were unsure of how they would release the short, saying rumors claiming ''The Prologue'' could possibly release on television or a future MCU home media release were \"speculations\".<ref name=\"Prologue\" />\n\nIn July 2013, D'Esposito said he had considered making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], a young Nick Fury, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Regarding Loki, D'Esposito said \"Being on Asgard is very difficult for us to do in a short. It's just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it's over. One shot of Loki on Asgard.\" On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked \"It's very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going \u2026 We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s half baked because it\u2019s not good for us and it\u2019s not good for our fans.\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name=\"PearceTotalFilm\" />\n\nIn May 2015, Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]] stated that there were \"no active plans for the One-Shots to return\", but added that the studio was not opposed to continuing the series,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2015\" /> and there was already \"a backlog of ideas\" for potential One-Shots.<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2015\" /> In September 2015, Feige provided further comments on the return of the One-Shots, saying, \"The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [feature films] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go...[So] we do talk about [making more One-Shots] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> In June 2017, [[Spider-Man]] actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots.<ref name=\"Holland2017\" /> That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had \"a whole folder full of other One-Shots\" he had created.<ref name=\"PearsonOct2017\" /> [[Taika Waititi]], director of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and [[Miek]] from ''Ragnarok''. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially \"morph into extra content that's created prior to a film's release instead of for its home entertainment release\", noting the successful ''[[Team Thor (series)|Team Thor]]'' mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which \"were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in ''Ragnarok'' in a fun way. So there might be opportunities for more things like that.\"<ref name=\"FandangoOct2017\" /> In April 2018, D'Esposito noted that Disney hoped Marvel would continue with the One-Shot films, but admitted that the studio was \"just so busy\" focusing on their increased feature film output.<ref name=\"TooBusy2018\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |title=How Marvel is Turning to Short Films to Sell More DVDs, Blu-rays |last=Graser |first=Marc |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OwWmllFZ?url=http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |archivedate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\">{{cite av media|title=Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe|date=2014|location=''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Complete First Season'' Home media, bonus material|publisher=ABC Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Development -->\n\n<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/07/17/marvel-one-shots-agent-carter-ms-marvel-loki-young-nick-fury-black-panther/ |title=Marvel One-Shots: Might 'Agent Carter' clear way for Ms. Marvel, Loki, young Nick Fury, or Black Panther?

They are included as special features in the MCU films' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[digital distribution]] releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. The films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be self-contained stories that provide more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]] set in the MCU.\n\n''The Consultant'' (2011) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011) star [[Clark Gregg]] as Agent [[Phil Coulson]], and offer up self-contained stories about a day in the life of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. ''[[Item 47]]'' (2012) stars [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Jesse Bradford]] as a down-on-their-luck couple who find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun after the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''. ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' (2013) stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', while ''[[All Hail the King]]'' (2014) stars [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]] after the events of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.\n\n==Development==\nIn August 2011, Marvel announced that a couple of short films, designed to be self-contained stories,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> would be released [[direct-to-video]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\" The first two films were made in conjunction with [[Mick Ebeling|The Ebeling Group]] and were directed by Leythum and written by [[Eric Pearson]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Winderbaum added that the name of the shorts program was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> \n\n[[Marvel Studios]] co-president Louis D'Esposito later stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, \"There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] \u2013 and they take off. I could see that happening.\"<ref name=\"Item47\" /> When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that \"We would love to, but it's difficult because there's a cost to that. If [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] is flying around doing something, that [is] very costly. And first of all, what's the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" />\n\nDuring the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' panel at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], D'Esposito stated that bringing the shorts to theaters, to appear before features, was being considered.<ref name=\"Theaters\" /> In May 2014, it was revealed that a One-Shot would not be released with ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''{{'}}s home media,<ref name=\"CapTWS\" /> and in October 2014, it was revealed that ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''{{'}}s home media release would not include one either.<ref name=\"GotG\" /> ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] stated that a One-Shot was not included with the film due to lack of space on the disc.<ref name=\"GunnGotG\" />\n\n==Films==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in [[Harlem]] on [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]. The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] to release Blonsky into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. As [[Nick Fury]] does not want to release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a [[Scapegoat|patsy]] to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends \"The Consultant\": [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. As partially depicted in the post-credits scene of ''The Incredible Hulk'', a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who annoys Ross so much that he tries to have Stark removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.\n\nAt the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced that ''The Consultant'' would appear exclusively on the ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' [[Blu-ray]] release on September 13, 2011. It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by [[Paul Oakenfold]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> The short was filmed over 2\u20133 days.<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> [[Clark Gregg]] and [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]] return to portray Agent Phil Coulson and Agent Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from the films.<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> They are joined via archive footage by [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] as Tony Stark / The Consultant, [[William Hurt]] as General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross and [[Tim Roth]] as Emil Blonsky in his Abomination form.<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Co-producer Brian Winderbaum said the producers \"wanted to paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the [[Iron Man (2008 film)|first ''Iron Man'' film]]?\"<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in ''The Avengers''. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to \"build the audience's relationship [with] him\" before his impactful death. ''The Consultant'' was written after ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'', due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget \"[[Bottle episode|for two guys talking]]\". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in ''Thor'', and had him and Coulson \"brainstorming a way to deal with this [[red tape]] bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative\".<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011){{anchor|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer}}===\nSet before the events of ''Thor'',<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Phil Coulson stops at a gas station on his way to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. While Coulson shops for snacks in the back of the station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, surrenders his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.\n\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' was included on the ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' Blu-ray release on October 25, 2011.<ref name=\"ThorHammerRelease\" /> It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold.<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> ''A Funny Thing...'' was filmed over 2\u20133 days.<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> The short stars Clark Gregg reprising his role as Agent Phil Coulson,<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> and served to showcase Coulson as \"more than just an annoying bureaucrat\" of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''Item 47'' (2012){{anchor|Item 47}}===\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Jesse Bradford by David Shankbone.jpg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Lizzy Caplan at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2 = 110\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Newcomers to the MCU, [[Jesse Bradford]] (left) and [[Lizzy Caplan]] (right) starred in ''Item 47''.\n}}\n{{main|Item 47}}\nBennie and Claire, a down-on-their-luck couple, find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun (\"Item 47\") left over from the attack on New York City in ''The Avengers''.

Agent Sitwell tracks the couple down to a motel room that gets wrecked in the subsequent confrontation, and the stolen money gets destroyed. Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D., with Bennie assigned to the [[Research and development|R&D]] 'think-tank' to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology, and Claire becoming Blake's assistant.\n\n''Item 47'' was released on ''The Avengers'' Blu-ray on September 25, 2012.

One night while alone in the office, the case line rings, informing Carter of the location of the mysterious [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. She goes to the location, and is able to retrieve the serum single-handedly. The next day, her boss, Agent John Flynn, reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission. Carter explains that the mission was time-sensitive, but Flynn is unmoved, dismissing the indignant Carter as an \"old flame\" of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]'s who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. The case line rings again, this time with [[Howard Stark]] on the other end, who tells Flynn to inform Carter that she will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credit scene, [[Dum Dum Dugan]] is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created [[bikini]]s.\n\n''Agent Carter'', released on the ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013, as well as part of the digital download release on September 3, 2013,<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" /> was seen as a good way of bridging that film with the then upcoming ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''. It had previously been considered to be released on other home media releases as well.<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> It sees [[Hayley Atwell]] reprise her role as Peggy Carter,<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" /> along with [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Neal McDonough]], and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] reprising their roles as Howard Stark, Timothy \"Dum Dum\" Dugan, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively, with Evans appearing via archive footage.

At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal \"butler\", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is [[Justin Hammer]], who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has been talking with a documentary filmmaker, [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]], to chronicle the events of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] situation seen in ''Iron Man 3''. Trying to learn more about him personally, Norriss recounts Slattery's past from his first casting as a child to his starring in a failed [[CBS]] pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.\n\nIn October 2013, [[Ben Kingsley]] said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \"many members of the crew that were involved in ''Iron Man 3'',\"<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\" /> later revealed to be the short ''All Hail the King'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> which was released on the digital download release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release.<ref name=\"AHTK\" /> The film stars: Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 3''; [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jackson Norriss, a member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker;<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /><ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> [[Lester Speight]] as Herman;<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> and [[Sam Rockwell]] as Justin Hammer, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" /> The short is written and directed by [[Drew Pearce]], the co-screenwriter of ''Iron Man 3'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> and was filmed in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> Pearce and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short during the production of ''Iron Man 3'', to provide \"a fresh take\" on the Mandarin character.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> Music for the short was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], with the ''Caged Heat'' scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon [[Mike Post]].<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe film actors|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors}}\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">'''List indicator(s)'''\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film<!--, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been announced-->.\n*A {{note|television|T}} indicates the character reappears in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors|television series]].\n*A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role\n*An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates the actor or actress appears via archived footage from previous films.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=99%\n!

The collection was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nCindy White of [[IGN]] called ''The Consultant'' \"intriguing\" and said, \"The snappy dialogue seems to fit right in with what we expect from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie.\"<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, \"Considering a third of this is a rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this is a pretty big disappointment.\"<ref name=\"ComingSoonConsultant\" />\n\nR.L. Shaffer of IGN called ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' \"fun\".<ref name=\"IGNHammer\" /> Zachary Scheer of Cinema Blend said, \"The short is as hackneyed as that title. It's about four minutes of Coulson being a badass, if the definition of 'badass' is performing needless slow-motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider \u2013 like which donuts to buy.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendHammer\" />\n\nAndre Dellamorte of Collider called ''Item 47'' \"silly\".<ref name=\"ColliderItem47\" /> William Bibbiani of [[Crave Online]] said, \"The short is largely a success: [Maximiliano] Hernandez, [Jesse] Bradford and [Lizzy] Caplan are all in fine form although, [Titus] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, particularly in regards to Coulson, which doesn't entirely sell.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineItem47\" /> Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, \"[''Item 47''] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that can be attributed to its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to \u2013 we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view.\"<ref name=\"SHHItem47\" />\n\nAndy Hunsaker of Crave Online said, \"''Agent Carter'' is a fun treat which could lead the way for some female-led Marvel films and, if nothing else, it gives its title character the send-off she deserves.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> Scott Collura of IGN said, \"Atwell's Carter is the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\"<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" /> Rosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' said, \"Atwell makes a perfect femme fatale-come-special agent, and this '40s noir-style short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" />\n\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" /> Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==Potential projects==\nIn May 2013, [[DMG Entertainment]] stated they were considering creating a short film, tentatively titled ''The Prologue'', centered on [[Wang Xueqi]]'s character, Dr. Wu, from ''Iron Man 3'', who only appeared in 10 seconds of the film outside of China; Xueqi appeared in three minutes of the Chinese release of the film. ''The Prologue'' would be composed of sequences shot during the production of ''Iron Man 3'' and would elaborate on Wu with the short set before the events of ''Iron Man''. DMG added they were unsure of how they would release the short, saying rumors claiming ''The Prologue'' could possibly release on television or a future MCU home media release were \"speculations\".<ref name=\"Prologue\" />\n\nIn July 2013, D'Esposito said he had considered making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], a young Nick Fury, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Regarding Loki, D'Esposito said \"Being on Asgard is very difficult for us to do in a short. It's just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it's over. One shot of Loki on Asgard.\" On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked \"It's very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going \u2026 We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s half baked because it\u2019s not good for us and it\u2019s not good for our fans.\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name=\"PearceTotalFilm\" />\n\nIn May 2015, Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]] stated that there were \"no active plans for the One-Shots to return\", but added that the studio was not opposed to continuing the series,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2015\" /> and there was already \"a backlog of ideas\" for potential One-Shots.<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2015\" /> In September 2015, Feige provided further comments on the return of the One-Shots, saying, \"The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [feature films] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go...[So] we do talk about [making more One-Shots] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> In June 2017, [[Spider-Man]] actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots.<ref name=\"Holland2017\" /> That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had \"a whole folder full of other One-Shots\" he had created.<ref name=\"PearsonOct2017\" /> [[Taika Waititi]], director of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and [[Miek]] from ''Ragnarok''. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially \"morph into extra content that's created prior to a film's release instead of for its home entertainment release\", noting the successful ''[[Team Thor (series)|Team Thor]]'' mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which \"were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in ''Ragnarok'' in a fun way.

Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Aryans. During the height of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], approximately 2000 BCE, the Harappan colony, now known as [[Shortugai]], was established near the lapis mines.<ref name=bc1995/>\n\nAccording to the [[Sorbonne]]'s mineralogist Pierre Bariand's leading work on the sources of lapis lazuli in modern times, and to references in ''Afghanistan's Blue Treasure: Lapis Lazuli'' (2011) by Lailee McNair Bakhtiar, the lapis lazuli is found in \"caves\" not traditionally considered \"mines\" and the stone lapis lazuli is from the primary source of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan's Kochka River Valley and not in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the [[Andes]] (near [[Ovalle, Chile|Ovalle]], [[Chile]]); and to the west of [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui Lazurite deposit.  It is mined in smaller amounts in [[Angola]], Argentina, [[Burma]], Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in [[California]] and [[Colorado]].<ref name=CGA/>\n\n===Uses and substitutes===\nLapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewelry, carvings, boxes, [[mosaic]]s, ornaments, small statues, and vases. During the [[Renaissance]], lapis was ground and processed to make the [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]] for use in [[fresco]]es and [[oil painting]]. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available.\n\nLapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gilson process, which is used to make artificial [[ultramarine]] and hydrous zinc phosphates.<ref>Read, Peter (2005).

It is mentioned several times in the Mesopotamian poem, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (17th\u201318th Century BCE), one of the oldest known works of literature.

Lapis jewelry has been found at excavations of the [[Predynastic Egypt]]ian site [[Naqada]] (3300\u20133100 BCE). At [[Karnak]], the relief carvings of [[Thutmose III]] (1479-1429 BCE) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute.

Eichholtz, Oxford University Press, 1965.</ref>\n\nThere are many references to sapphires in the [[Old Testament]], but most scholars agree that, since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: \"And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone...\" (KJV).

Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Aryans. During the height of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], approximately 2000 BCE, the Harappan colony, now known as [[Shortugai]], was established near the lapis mines.<ref name=bc1995/>\n\nAccording to the [[Sorbonne]]'s mineralogist Pierre Bariand's leading work on the sources of lapis lazuli in modern times, and to references in ''Afghanistan's Blue Treasure: Lapis Lazuli'' (2011) by Lailee McNair Bakhtiar, the lapis lazuli is found in \"caves\" not traditionally considered \"mines\" and the stone lapis lazuli is from the primary source of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan's Kochka River Valley and not in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the [[Andes]] (near [[Ovalle, Chile|Ovalle]], [[Chile]]); and to the west of [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui Lazurite deposit.  It is mined in smaller amounts in [[Angola]], Argentina, [[Burma]], Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in [[California]] and [[Colorado]].<ref name=CGA/>\n\n===Uses and substitutes===\nLapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewelry, carvings, boxes, [[mosaic]]s, ornaments, small statues, and vases. During the [[Renaissance]], lapis was ground and processed to make the [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]] for use in [[fresco]]es and [[oil painting]]. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available.\n\nLapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gilson process, which is used to make artificial [[ultramarine]] and hydrous zinc phosphates.<ref>Read, Peter (2005).

At [[Karnak]], the relief carvings of [[Thutmose III]] (1479-1429 BCE) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute.
