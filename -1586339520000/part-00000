Based on the evidence in the surviving photos, it is unlikely that Guru Nanak wrote or maintained a pothi. The features in its Gurmukhi script and the language suggest that the hymns are significantly older, and that the pre-canonical hymns were being written down in early Sikhism and preserved by the Sikh Gurus prior to the editing by Guru Arjan.

McLeod, the difference in the two versions can be because of three possibilities, from which he withholds judgment:<ref>W.H.

According to G.B. Singh \u2013 a Sikh scholar who pioneered study of the early Sikh manuscripts, the evidence supports the second theory.<ref name=kanpur1/><ref>G.B.

There are five views:<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=125\u2013128}};<br>For a more comprehensive discussion of these theories and evidence, see: {{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiwpDwAAQBAJ| year=2003|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-908773-0}}</ref>\n*The first view held by scholars such as Balwant Singh Dhillon states that there was a consistent \"mother tradition\", where the hymns of Guru Nanak were carefully preserved as a single codex without any corruption or unauthorized changes, to which the later Gurus added additional hymns. The Sikh scripture developed in linear, pure form becoming first the Adi Granth and finally the closed version of the Guru Granth Sahib. According to this view, there were no pre-canonical diversity, the scripture developed in an organized and disciplined format, and it denies the existence of alternate hymns and texts that were cherished by Sikhs of an earlier era.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The second view held by scholars such as Gurinder Singh Mann states that the scripture started from a single process, proceeded linearly, then diversified into separate textual traditions with some variations, over time. This school of scholars supports their theory by highlighting the similarities of the manuscripts and close match particularly between the three manuscripts called the Guru Har Sahai MS, the Govindval MS, and the Guru Nanak Dev University MS 1245.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> This theory is weakened by variations observed in 27 manuscript variants now dated between 1642 and 1692. The alternate formulation of this theory states that two branches developed over time, with the Peshawar pothi and Kartarpur pothi being the two branches.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The third view held by scholars such as Piar Singh states that independent versions of the Sikh scripture developed in geographically distant regions of the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These versions developed because of the forgetfulness or creativity of the local Sikh leaders, errors made by scribes, attempts to adopt popular hymns of bhagats or adapt the hymns to local regional languages where Gurmukhi was not understood. It is these manuscripts that Guru Arjan collected and considered, then edited to produce an approved version of the Adi Granth. The Sikh scripture, according to this school, was thus a collaborative effort and there was no authentic version of the pre-canonical text in Sikhism.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fourth view builds upon this third view and is supported by scholars such as Jeevan Deol. According to this view, there were independent textual traditions in Sikhism before Guru Arjan decided to edit and redact them into the Adi Granth.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These textual traditions developed in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, greatly influenced by the popularity of regional bhagats and their [[Bhakti movement]] ideas about ''nirguna'' and ''saguna'' forms of the divine, with Guru Arjan favoring the ''nirgun'' versions. The Adi Granth reflects the review, editing and compilation of complex and diverse textual traditions before him.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fifth view held by scholars such as Pashaura Singh develops and refines the fourth view. It states that the Sikh scripture emerged from a collaborative effort of Guru Arjan and his trusted associates, particularly Bhai Gurdas and Jagana Brahmin of Agra. His collaborators were his devout admirers, well versed in the Sikh thought, Sanskrit traditions and philosophical schools of Indian religions.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variant manuscripts support this theory, as does the handwriting analysis of the Kartarpur bir (manuscript) approved by Guru Arjan which shows at least four distinct scribal styles.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variations in the manuscripts also affirm that the ''Adi Granth'' did not develop in a linear way, i.e. it was not simply copied from a previous version.<ref name=\"MannMann2001p33\"/><ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

This has triggered contesting theories about authenticity and how the canonical text of Sikhism evolved over time. There are five views:<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=125\u2013128}};<br>For a more comprehensive discussion of these theories and evidence, see: {{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiwpDwAAQBAJ| year=2003|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-908773-0}}</ref>\n*The first view held by scholars such as Balwant Singh Dhillon states that there was a consistent \"mother tradition\", where the hymns of Guru Nanak were carefully preserved as a single codex without any corruption or unauthorized changes, to which the later Gurus added additional hymns. The Sikh scripture developed in linear, pure form becoming first the Adi Granth and finally the closed version of the Guru Granth Sahib. According to this view, there were no pre-canonical diversity, the scripture developed in an organized and disciplined format, and it denies the existence of alternate hymns and texts that were cherished by Sikhs of an earlier era.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The second view held by scholars such as Gurinder Singh Mann states that the scripture started from a single process, proceeded linearly, then diversified into separate textual traditions with some variations, over time. This school of scholars supports their theory by highlighting the similarities of the manuscripts and close match particularly between the three manuscripts called the Guru Har Sahai MS, the Govindval MS, and the Guru Nanak Dev University MS 1245.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> This theory is weakened by variations observed in 27 manuscript variants now dated between 1642 and 1692. The alternate formulation of this theory states that two branches developed over time, with the Peshawar pothi and Kartarpur pothi being the two branches.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The third view held by scholars such as Piar Singh states that independent versions of the Sikh scripture developed in geographically distant regions of the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These versions developed because of the forgetfulness or creativity of the local Sikh leaders, errors made by scribes, attempts to adopt popular hymns of bhagats or adapt the hymns to local regional languages where Gurmukhi was not understood. It is these manuscripts that Guru Arjan collected and considered, then edited to produce an approved version of the Adi Granth. The Sikh scripture, according to this school, was thus a collaborative effort and there was no authentic version of the pre-canonical text in Sikhism.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fourth view builds upon this third view and is supported by scholars such as Jeevan Deol. According to this view, there were independent textual traditions in Sikhism before Guru Arjan decided to edit and redact them into the Adi Granth.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/> These textual traditions developed in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, greatly influenced by the popularity of regional bhagats and their [[Bhakti movement]] ideas about ''nirguna'' and ''saguna'' forms of the divine, with Guru Arjan favoring the ''nirgun'' versions. The Adi Granth reflects the review, editing and compilation of complex and diverse textual traditions before him.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p125\"/>\n*The fifth view held by scholars such as Pashaura Singh develops and refines the fourth view. It states that the Sikh scripture emerged from a collaborative effort of Guru Arjan and his trusted associates, particularly Bhai Gurdas and Jagana Brahmin of Agra. His collaborators were his devout admirers, well versed in the Sikh thought, Sanskrit traditions and philosophical schools of Indian religions.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variant manuscripts support this theory, as does the handwriting analysis of the Kartarpur bir (manuscript) approved by Guru Arjan which shows at least four distinct scribal styles.<ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\"/> The variations in the manuscripts also affirm that the ''Adi Granth'' did not develop in a linear way, i.e. it was not simply copied from a previous version.<ref name=\"MannMann2001p33\"/><ref name=\"SinghFenech2014p127\">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

Poulenc composed it for the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], and he and Rampal gave the premiere in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made an orchestrated version of the work.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015).

Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\",{{refn|Poulenc had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\".

In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finale's of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata.

Among the earlier ones are those by [[Michel Debost]] with [[Jacques Fevrier]] and Rampal with Veyron-Lacroix.

The difficulty is the entirely pianistic nature of the accompaniment, extremely difficult to translate into orchestral terms. ... Another difficulty is that Francis, though there are things I love in his music, has passages that are strangely clumsy and that I long to rewrite, but of course I can't add or subtract anything and I should only spoil the whole thing \u2026 I have to think all the time of how he would have wanted it to sound.<ref name=lb>Berkeley, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>|}}\nThe musicologist [[Roger Covell]] wrote of Berkeley's orchestration, \"It is hard to imagine the job being done better \u2026 this sonata-concerto has Poulenc's characteristic and attractive mixture of flippancy and tenderness\".<ref>Covell, Roger. \"Classical\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 1986, p. 56</ref> ''[[The Musical Times]]'' commented in 1978 that \"the orchestration does complete justice to the composer. [It] adds a worthwhile new dimension to the music: the long-drawn sad melodic lines played by the flute, especially in the first two movements, are complemented in a way not possible on the piano\".<ref>O'Loughlin, Niall.
