{"title_page": "Fritz Hochw\u00e4lder", "text_new": "[[File:Fritz Hochw\u00e4lder.jpg|thumb|right|Fritz Hochw\u00e4lder]]\n'''Fritz Hochw\u00e4lder''' (28 May 1911 &ndash; 21 October 1986) also known as '''Fritz Hochwaelder''', was an [[Austria]]n playwright. Known for his spare prose and strong moralist themes, Hochw\u00e4lder won several literary awards, including the [[Grand Austrian State Prize for Literature]] in 1966.  Most of his plays were first performed at the [[Burgtheater]] in [[Vienna]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Vienna, Austria]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387877/ IMDb]</ref> Hochw\u00e4lder wrote social and political dramas, using historical themes in his plays. One of his earlier works ''Das Heilige Experiment'' (1942; adapted for the screen in 1959: [[The Strong Are Lonely]]) drew on the violent dismantling of a utopian [[Jesuit]] settlement by the Spaniards in [[Paraguay]] in the 1760s and ''Der \u00f6ffentliche Ankl\u00e4ger'' ([[The Public Prosecutor]], 1948) delved into the violence of the [[French Revolution]]. The theme of violence was a major factor in his own life\u2014in fact, without the Nazi rise to power, Hochw\u00e4lder may not have become a successful playwright.\n\nBefore the beginning of [[World War II]], Hochw\u00e4lder worked as a craftsman (an upholsterer\u2019s apprentice) in Vienna.  In 1938, Hochw\u00e4lder escaped Austria and the Nazis by entering [[Switzerland]] illegally. He escaped after waiting futilely for an entry visa from any country and in this way his experiences reinforced the [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s ironic quip that in those days the world was divided into two kinds of countries: countries that wanted to be rid of Jews and those that refused to accept them. (Hochw\u00e4lder's parents were both murdered in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in the Czech Republic.)\n\nAfter entering Switzerland, Hochw\u00e4lder spent some time in refugee camps. As he was barred by the Swiss from working in his profession, he began in earnest to write plays (he had also written plays in pre-war Vienna without much critical success).\n\nAfter he left the camps, he lived in Zurich where he met and was influenced by [[Georg Kaiser]], another exiled playwright. Kaiser was his senior by several decades and also wrote tightly constructed plays with psychological underpinnings and a strong moralist stance. Hochw\u00e4lder's 1945 play ''Der Fl\u00fcchtling'' ([[The Refugee (play)|The Refugee]]) was attributed by the author to a suggestion from the German dramatist.\n\n[[Martin Esslin]], the renowned drama professor and theater critic, wrote in the introduction to ''The Public Prosecutor and Other Plays'': \"No one who has come into contact with Hochw\u00e4lder's dramatic work, no one who has been privileged to meet him in person, can fail to be impressed by the integrity, the sheer straightforward commitment to the highest value of decency and civilization that are the hallmarks of the writer and craftsman as well as the man.\"\n\nEsslin, who translated some of Hochw\u00e4lder's plays into English, also commented on the juxtaposition of violent themes with a humanistic message. \"Again and again the message that his plays leave with the attentive reader and spectator is one of the humanity, forgiveness, reconciliation, and a refusal to fall into the trap set by the violent to the nonviolent, of converting them to their own methods.\"\n\nEsslin, who coined the term \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\", may well have found compelling Hochw\u00e4lder's often paradoxical plot twists.  For example, ''Der Himbeerpfl\u00fccker'' ([[The Raspberry Picker]], 1965) shows how the leaders of an Austrian town mistake a small town crook for a Nazi war criminal and treat him as a returning hero. This play was undoubtedly a homage to [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'', but Hochw\u00e4lder was able to put his own historical spin and moral message on the saga of mistaken identity.\n\nAlthough Hochw\u00e4lder spent most of his life after the war in Switzerland, he was buried in Vienna.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* 1955 City of Vienna Prize for Literature\n* 1956 [[Franz-Grillparzer-Preis|Grillparzer Prize]]\n* 1962 [[Anton Wildgans Prize]]\n* 1966 [[Grand Austrian State Prize for Literature]]\n* 1971 [[Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art]], 1st class<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=316 |trans-title=| format = pdf | accessdate = 16 November 2012 }}</ref>\n* 1972 Ring of Honour of the City of Vienna\n* 1979 Franz Theodor Csokor Award\n* 1980 [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Works ==\n{{div col}}\n*''Die unziemliche Neugier'' (1934; published in 1979)\n*''Esther'' (1940)\n*''Das heilige Experiment'' (1942)\n*''H\u00f4tel du Commerce'' (1944)\n*''Meier Helmbrecht'' (1946)\n*''Der \u00f6ffentliche Ankl\u00e4ger'' (1948)\n*''Donadieu'' (1953)\n*''Die Herberge'' (1955)\n*''Der Unschuldige'' (1958)\n*''Donnerstag'' (1959)\n*''Holokaust.(Totengericht)'' (1960; published 1998)\n*''1003'' (1963)\n*''Der Himbeerpfl\u00fccker'' (1964)\n*''Der Befehl'' (1968)\n*''Lazaretti oder Der S\u00e4beltiger'' (1973)\n*''Die Prinzessin von Chimay'' (1982)\n*''Der verschwundene Mond'' (1982)\n*''Die B\u00fcrgschaft'' (1984)\n*''Donnerstag.

Hugh Herbert at AllMovie.com]</ref> He emigrated in the United States from England on the S/S ''Kroonland'', which docked at the port of New York on September 11, 1920. He began his film career in 1926 with two projects starring [[Conrad Nagel]], ''The Waning Sex'' and ''There You Are!'', the latter adapted from his play of the same title. His screenwriting credits included ''[[Vanity Fair (1932 film)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Fashions of 1934]]''; ''[[Smarty (film)|Smarty]]'' in 1934, adapted from his own play; ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]''; ''[[Dark Command]]''; ''[[Our Very Own (1950 film)|Our Very Own]]''; ''[[The Little Hut]]''; ''[[Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!]]'' and ''[[The Girls of Pleasure Island]]'', the last two of which he also directed. He co-wrote a few films in which the similarly named, but unrelated actor [[Hugh Herbert]] appeared: ''[[Fashions of 1934]]'' (1934), ''[[We're in the Money (film)|We're in the Money]]'' (1935) and ''[[Colleen (1936 film)|Colleen]]'' (1936).\n\nOne of Herbert's most enduring creations was the character of American teenager Corliss Archer, who was introduced in 1943 in a series of ''Good Housekeeping'' short stories. The story cycle was quickly adapted to radio, as ''Meet Corliss Archer,'' and to theatre, as ''Kiss and Tell''.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1278 ''Kiss and Tell'' at the Internet Broadway Database]</ref>  [[Shirley Temple]] performed Corliss on screen in 1945 and 1949. Herbert's property was later adapted as a comic book series also titled ''[[Meet Corliss Archer]]'', as well as a television series.\n\nHerbert's play ''The Moon Is Blue'' had a run of 924 performances on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1929 ''The Moon is Blue'' at the Internet Broadway Database]</ref> which was adapted for [[The Moon is Blue|the screen version]] produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]], who had been responsible for the stage production. The film adaptation, released in 1953, was controversial at the time owing to its frank language and sexual themes.

Hugh Herbert at AllMovie.com]</ref> He emigrated in the United States from England on the S/S ''Kroonland'', which docked at the port of New York on September 11, 1920. He began his film career in 1926 with two projects starring [[Conrad Nagel]], ''The Waning Sex'' and ''There You Are!'', the latter adapted from his play of the same title. His screenwriting credits included ''[[Vanity Fair (1932 film)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Fashions of 1934]]''; ''[[Smarty (film)|Smarty]]'' in 1934, adapted from his own play; ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]''; ''[[Dark Command]]''; ''[[Our Very Own (1950 film)|Our Very Own]]''; ''[[The Little Hut]]''; ''[[Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!]]'' and ''[[The Girls of Pleasure Island]]'', the last two of which he also directed. He co-wrote a few films in which the similarly named, but unrelated actor [[Hugh Herbert]] appeared: ''[[Fashions of 1934]]'' (1934), ''[[We're in the Money (film)|We're in the Money]]'' (1935) and ''[[Colleen (1936 film)|Colleen]]'' (1936).\n\nOne of Herbert's most enduring creations was the character of American teenager Corliss Archer, who was introduced in 1943 in a series of ''Good Housekeeping'' short stories. The story cycle was quickly adapted to radio, as ''Meet Corliss Archer,'' and to theatre, as ''Kiss and Tell''<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1278 ''Kiss and Tell'' at the Internet Broadway Database]</ref>.  [[Shirley Temple]] performed Corliss on screen in 1945 and 1949. Herbert's property was later adapted as a comic book series also titled ''[[Meet Corliss Archer]]'', as well as a television series.\n\nHerbert's play ''The Moon Is Blue'' had a run of 924 performances on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1929 ''The Moon is Blue'' at the Internet Broadway Database]</ref> which was adapted for [[The Moon is Blue|the screen version]] produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]], who had been responsible for the stage production. The film adaptation, released in 1953, was controversial at the time owing to its frank language and sexual themes.
