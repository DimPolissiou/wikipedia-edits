A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career.

When describing the ceremonial presentation to [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., of a [[sundial]] memorializing Banneker, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper reported in that year that a speaker had claimed that:\n\n<blockquote>.... he (Banneker) was appointed by President George Washington to aid Major L'Enfant, famed French architect, to plan the layout of the District of Columbia.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

In 1971 and 1999, Bedini wrote that Banneker had constructed his clock from his recollections of that watch ([https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/42/mode/1up Bedini, 1971, p. 42.] and [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/42/mode/2up Bedini, 1999, pp. 42\u201443.]). Bedini did not identify his source for those statements. In 2008, when again describing Banneker's clock, Bedini more cautiously wrote: \"It is said that it was based on his recollections of the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" ([http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx|date=2016-02-03}}).</ref>\n\nFurther, it is open to question as to whether the clock was actually \"remarkable\". Silvio Bedini reported that at least four clockmakers were working in Annapolis, Maryland, before 1753, when Banneker completed his own clock.<ref name=Annapolis/>\n\nA photograph on the historical marker illustrates a wooden striking clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed around 1760.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/><ref>Note: [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini, 1999] contains on [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/45/mode/1up page 45] a photograph of a striking wooden clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed in Connecticut around 1760 that the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] holds in its collections. The wooden clock shown in the Benjamin Banneker Park historical marker is identical to the one shown in the photograph in Bedini, 1999.</ref> The marker does not indicate that the clock is not Banneker's.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/> A fire on the day of Banneker's funeral reportedly destroyed his own clock.<ref name=Bailey/><ref name=Tyson18/>\n\n===Historical marker in Newseum, Washington, DC===\nIn 2008, when the [[Newseum]] opened to the public on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., visitors looking over the Avenue could read a historical marker that stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nBenjamin Banneker assisted Chief Surveyor Andrew Ellicott in laying out the Avenue based on Pierre L'Enfant's Plan. President George Washington appointed Ellicott and Banneker to survey the boundaries of the new city.<ref>Text of historic marker entitled \"1800\u20131860 \u2013 Benjamin Banneker\" on outdoor overlook of Pennsylvania Avenue on Level 6 of Newseum, 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.
