However, during the mid-1920s, this dominance eroded as competitors, especially the various General Motors divisions, caught up with Ford's mass production system and began to better<!--higher quality is not \"outcompeting\", is it?--> Ford in some areas, especially by offering more powerful engines, new convenience features, or cosmetic customization.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp217-219\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217\u2013219}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp263-264\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263\u2013264}}.</ref><ref name=\"Sloan1964pp162-163\">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=162\u2013163}}.</ref> Also, features [[Henry Ford]] considered to be unnecessary, such as [[Starter motor|electric starters]], were gradually shifting in the public's perception from luxuries to essentials.\n\nFord's sales force recognized the threat and advised Henry to respond to it. Initially he resisted, but the T's sagging market share finally forced him to admit a replacement was needed. When he finally agreed to begin development of this new model, he focused on the mechanical aspects and on what today is called [[design for manufacturability]] (DFM), which he had always strongly embraced and for which the Model T production system was famous. Although ultimately successful,<!--aside: this was clear, if unencyclopedic, before :D Feel free to remove the cmt. ;p--> the development of the Model A included many problems that had to be resolved.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp280-292\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280\u2013292}}.</ref> For example, the [[Die (manufacturing)|die stamping of parts from sheet steel]], which the Ford company had led to new heights of development with the Model T production system, was something Henry had always been ambivalent about; it had brought success, but he felt that it was not the best choice for durability. He was determined that the Model A would rely more on [[drop forging]]s than the Model T, but his ideas to improve the DFM of forging did not prove practical. Eventually, Ford's engineers persuaded him to relent, lest the Model A's production cost force up its retail price too much.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp280-281\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280\u2013281}}.</ref>\n\nHenry's disdain for cosmetic vanity as applied to automobiles led him to leave the Model A's styling to a team led by his son [[Edsel Ford|Edsel]], even though he would take credit for it despite his son doing more of the work.\n\nIt was during the period from the mid-1920s to early 1930s that the limits of the first generation of [[mass production]], epitomized by the Model T production system's rigidity, became apparent. The era of \"[[Flexible manufacturing system|flexible mass production]]\" had begun.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp263-301\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263\u2013301}}, Chapter 7: Cul-de-sac: The Limits of [[Fordism]] & the Coming of \"Flexible Mass Production\".</ref><ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp217-231\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217\u2013231}}, Chapter 16: Farewell to Model T.</ref>\n\n==Film and media==\nThe Model A was well represented in media of the era since it was one of the most common cars.

Previous Fords used controls that had become uncommon to drivers of other makes. The Model A's fuel tank was situated in the cowl, between the engine compartment's fire wall and the dash panel. It had a visual fuel gauge, and the fuel flowed to the carburetor by gravity. A rear-view mirror was optional.<ref name=\"kimes1996\"/> In cooler climates, owners could purchase an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] cast iron unit to place over the exhaust manifold to provide heat to the cab.

However, during the mid-1920s, this dominance eroded as competitors, especially the various General Motors divisions, caught up with Ford's mass production system and began to better<!--higher quality is not \"outcompeting\", is it?--> Ford in some areas, especially by offering more powerful engines, new convenience features, or cosmetic customization.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp217-219\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217\u2013219}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp263-264\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263\u2013264}}.</ref><ref name=\"Sloan1964pp162-163\">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=162\u2013163}}.</ref> Also, features [[Henry Ford]] considered to be unnecessary, such as [[Starter motor|electric starters]], were gradually shifting in the public's perception from luxuries to essentials.\n\nFord's sales force recognized the threat and advised Henry to respond to it. Initially he resisted, but the T's sagging market share finally forced him to admit a replacement was needed. When he finally agreed to begin development of this new model, he focused on the mechanical aspects and on what today is called [[design for manufacturability]] (DFM), which he had always strongly embraced and for which the Model T production system was famous. Although ultimately successful,<!--aside: this was clear, if unencyclopedic, before :D Feel free to remove the cmt. ;p--> the development of the Model A included many problems that had to be resolved.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp280-292\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280\u2013292}}.</ref> For example, the [[Die (manufacturing)|die stamping of parts from sheet steel]], which the Ford company had led to new heights of development with the Model T production system, was something Henry had always been ambivalent about; it had brought success, but he felt that it was not the best choice for durability. He was determined that the Model A would rely more on [[drop forging]]s than the Model T, but his ideas to improve the DFM of forging did not prove practical. Eventually, Ford's engineers persuaded him to relent, lest the Model A's production cost force up its retail price too much.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp280-281\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280\u2013281}}.</ref>\n\nHenry's disdain for cosmetic vanity as applied to automobiles led him to leave the Model A's styling to a team led by his son [[Edsel Ford|Edsel]], even though he would take credit for it despite his son doing more of the work.\n\nIt was during the period from the mid-1920s to early 1930s that the limits of the first generation of [[mass production]], epitomized by the Model T production system's rigidity, became apparent.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.
