If lifting the head/eyes in order to determine where to shoot, which may be necessary in various circumstances, this should be done before taking the shot.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.completesoccerguide.com/how-to-kick-a-soccer-ball/ |title=How to Kick a Soccer Ball |publisher=The Complete Soccer Guide |date= |accessdate=2015-03-24}}</ref> The athlete\u2019s vision should be focused directly at the ball through the entirety of the kicking action in order to increase accuracy.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Support (stance) leg===\nJust prior to the swing phase, the athlete should land on the supporting leg with the knee slightly flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg.<ref>Katis, A., Giannadakis, E., Kannas, T., Amiridis, I., Kellis, E., & Lees, A.

An in-step football kick involves a performer striking the football with the dorsal (top) part of the foot. The various lower body muscles that are required for this motion are also analyzed.\n\n===Movement analysis===\nSix distinct stages are involved in the kick: the approach angle, the plant foot force, the swing limb loading, the swinging phase, ball contact, and the follow through.<ref name=Barfield1998/> The first is the \u201capproach angle\u201d when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is the swing limb loading that requires the preparation of the [[hip flexor]]s and [[quadriceps|knee extensors]] to load or [[muscle contraction|eccentrically stretch]] for forward movement in order for the swinging limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the [[hip flexor]]s and [[quadriceps|knee extensors]] initiate a forceful contraction in the swinging limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered the swinging phase. The fifth stage is when the swinging foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with the swing of the limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase.\n\n===Joints===\nJoint motions are focused on the lower extremities; although there is recognition of upper body joint movements during the kick.

Print</ref> These are some exercises for each muscle involved in a free kick that will improve balance, force and speed. These are functional exercises that can be done on the field in practice.\n\n===Trunk===\nThe muscles of the trunk stabilize the body before, during, and after impact with the ball during the kick (Major muscles involved; [[rectus abdominis]], [[psoas major]], and [[erector spinae]] muscles). The [[spider Crawl]] is a dynamic [[compound exercise]] that works mainly the core muscles such as [[rectus abdominis]], [[erector spinae]], and [[external obliques]] as well as the [[pectoralis major]], [[anterior deltoids]], and [[triceps]]. The [[spider crawl exercise]] aids in improving coordination by contra-laterally activating and coordinating the upper body with the lower body muscles. Moreover, crunches help to strengthen the [[rectus abdominis]] muscle and variations of planks engage the [[erector spinae]] and deeper back extensor muscles that aid in improving balance and posture. The [[superman exercise]] strengthens the lower back and improves flexibility in the lumbar region.\n\n===Hip===\nThe hip involves flexion and internal rotation on the kicking leg side ([[tensor fasciae latae]], [[rectus femoris]], [[psoas major]], [[iliacus]], [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]], [[pectineus]], [[adductor brevis]], [[longus]], and [[magnus]]), and extension on the \u201cplanted\u201d leg side ([[gluteus maximus]], hamstring group and adductor magnus. The [[side lunge]] increases strength of the quadriceps muscles, [[gluteus maximus]], and hip adductors & flexors. The side lunge improves balance by putting the body weight on the planted leg while trying to prevent falling back or forward. In addition, [[cariocas]] is an exercise in which the person moves laterally while facing forward by internally rotating the hip and stepping over with the leg contralateral to the direction of the movement. This exercise improves hip flexibility and agility by rotating the hip and stepping over quickly.\n\n===Legs===\nThe hip extends and knee flexes during the loading of swing phase and then during the latter part of swing phase the leg flexes on the hip and knee extends while plantar flexing the ankle to kick the ball. (Quadriceps group, hamstrings group and plantar flexors). [[Jumping squats]] are a [[plyometric]] exercise that improves force, speed which equals power and explosiveness on the legs. Mountain climbers are a great way to improve endurance due to the duration and high intensity nature of the exercise. In addition, [[Nordic hamstring curls]] are important to reduce the development of muscle imbalance and prevent injuries because the hamstring muscles are often neglected and injured during an explosive movement such as the soccer kick. Most importantly, sprints will improve speed, force, agility, and endurance because it requires explosiveness and coordination of the body segments.\n\n===Upper body===\nThe shoulder contralateral to the kicking leg is horizontally adducted and aids in counterbalancing the kick ([[anterior deltoid]], [[biceps brachii]], [[pectoralis major]]). For a football kick the upper body is not very active, but keeping a balance between the upper and lower body will reduce the torques created by forces of other segments.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football tactics and skills]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Kick (disambiguation)|Soccer kick}}\n[[File:ARS-OM 1314 Ramsey free kick (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Aaron Ramsey]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] kicking a football]]\nA '''kick''' is a skill in [[association football]] in which a player strikes the ball with his or her foot.

An in-step football kick involves a performer striking the football with the dorsal (top) part of the foot. The various lower body muscles that are required for this motion are also analyzed.\n\n===Movement analysis===\nSix distinct stages are involved in the kick: the approach angle, the plant foot force, the swing limb loading, the swinging phase, ball contact, and the follow through.<ref name=Barfield1998/> The first is the \u201capproach angle\u201d when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is the swing limb loading that requires the preparation of the [[hip flexor]]s and [[quadriceps|knee extensors]] to load or [[muscle contraction|eccentrically stretch]] for forward movement in order for the swinging limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the [[hip flexor]]s and [[quadriceps|knee extensors]] initiate a forceful contraction in the swinging limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered the swinging phase. The fifth stage is when the swinging foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with the swing of the limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase.\n\n===Joints===\nJoint motions are focused on the lower extremities; although there is recognition of upper body joint movements during the kick. Starting in stage 3, the kicking limb moves posterior of the positioned body, which is possible with hip extension.<ref name=Kellis2007/> The hip is also [[anatomical terms of motion|adducted]] and [[anatomical terms of motion|externally rotated]] with knee flexion, knee [[anatomical terms of motion|internal rotation]], and slight [[anatomical terms of motion|plantar flexion]] at the ankle joint on the kicking leg to prepare for impact with the ball.<ref name=Kellis2007/> When the kicking foot comes into contact with the ball, hip goes into flexion, [[anatomical terms of motion|abduction]], and [[anatomical terms of motion|external rotation]] with knee at a slight constant flexion.<ref name=Kellis2007/> The pelvis rotates around the supporting limb by raising the thigh of the kicking limb forward.<ref name=Kellis2007/>\nForward motion is initiated by rotating the pelvis around the supporting leg and by bring the thigh of the kicking leg forwards while the knee continues to flex.\nDuring the last stages (stage 5 and 6) of the kick, the kicking foot exhibits [[anatomical terms of motion|plantar flexion]] at the [[ankle]] joint when coming into contact with the ball.<ref name=Lees2010>Lees, A., Asai, T., Andersen, T.B., Nunome, H., & Sterzing, T.
