Elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[1850 United States House of Representatives elections|1850 congressional elections]], he switched to the newly-organized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the mid-1850s when the Democratic Party refused to prohibit the extension of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] into western territories.\n\nElected speaker for the [[37th United States Congress|37th Congress]], Grow presided over the House during the initial years of the [[American Civil War]]. During his tenure Congress passed the landmark [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act of 1862]], which he supported. Grow was defeated for reelection in [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862]]. For over a century he remained the last [[incumbent]] House speaker to be defeated, until Speaker [[Tom Foley]] lost his seat in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Foley, House Speaker, Dies at 84 |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/thomas-foley-former-house-speaker-dies-at-84.html?_r=0}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving office he continued to speak out on political issues, but did not serve in elective office. Then, 31 years after leaving office, Grow won an [[1894 United States House of Representatives elections#Special elections|1894 special election]] to succeed [[William Lilly (congressman)| William Lilly]]. It remains one of the longest known [[interregnum]]s between terms of service for a House member. Over the course of his career, Grow represented the people of three [[Pennsylvania]] congressional districts: the {{ushr|PA|12|c}} (1851\u20131853), {{ushr|PA|14|c}} (1853\u20131863), and {{ushr|PA|AL}} (1894\u20131903).\n\n==Early life and education==\nGrow was born '''Aaron Galusha Grow''' in [[Ashford, Connecticut]]. His [[given name]]s were the suggestions of an aunt living in Vermont, who was visiting Grow's mother when he was christened: \"Aaron\" was the aunt's husband's name (his full name was Aaron Nichols (1764-1807)), and [[Jonas Galusha|\"Galusha\" was the surname]] of a [[governor of Vermont]] she admired.<ref name=\"bio\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJIcAAAAMAAJ Galusha A.

He studied law and was admitted to the bar in November 1847 and then began his law practice.<ref>{{CongBio|G000507|inline=1}}</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\n\n[[File:Galusha Grow.png|thumb|upright|left|Galusha Grow, {{circa}} 1859]]\n\n=== Early elections===\nGrow ran as a [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democrat]] in the [[1850 United States House of Representatives elections|1850 election]] and served as a member of that party during the [[32nd United States Congress|32nd]] and [[33rd United States Congress|33rd]] congresses, and into the [[34th United States Congress|34th Congress]].

Keitt]] in the House chambers, leading to a brawl between northerners and southerners.  Keitt, offended by Grow's having stepped over to his side of the House chamber, dismissively demanded that Grow sit down, calling him a \"black Republican puppy\". Grow responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.\"  Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke [him] for that\". A large brawl involving approximately fifty representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

Elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[1850 United States House of Representatives elections|1850 congressional elections]], he switched to the newly-organized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the mid-1850s when the Democratic Party refused to prohibit the extension of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] into western territories.\n\nElected speaker for the [[37th United States Congress|37th Congress]], Grow presided over the House during the initial years of the [[American Civil War]]. During his tenure Congress passed the landmark [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act of 1862]], which he supported. Grow was defeated for reelection in [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862]]. For over a century he remained the last [[incumbent]] House speaker to be defeated, until Speaker [[Tom Foley]] lost his seat in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Foley, House Speaker, Dies at 84 |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/thomas-foley-former-house-speaker-dies-at-84.html?_r=0}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving office he continued to speak out on political issues, but did not serve in elective office. Then, 31 years after leaving office, Grow won an [[1894 United States House of Representatives elections#Special elections|1894 special election]] to succeed [[William Lilly]]. It remains one of the longest known [[interregnum]]s between terms of service for a House member. Over the course of his career, Grow represented the people of three [[Pennsylvania]] congressional districts: the {{ushr|PA|12|c}} (1851\u20131853), {{ushr|PA|14|c}} (1853\u20131863), and {{ushr|PA|AL}} (1894\u20131903).\n\n==Early life and education==\nGrow was born '''Aaron Galusha Grow''' in [[Ashford, Connecticut]]. His [[given name]]s were the suggestions of an aunt living in Vermont, who was visiting Grow's mother when he was christened: \"Aaron\" was the aunt's husband's name (his full name was Aaron Nichols (1764-1807)), and [[Jonas Galusha|\"Galusha\" was the surname]] of a [[governor of Vermont]] she admired.<ref name=\"bio\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJIcAAAAMAAJ Galusha A.

He studied law and was admitted to the bar in November 1847 and then began his law practice.<ref>{{CongBio|G000507|inline=1}}</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\n\n[[File:Galusha Grow.png|thumb|upright|left|Galusha Grow, {{circa}} 1859]]\n\n=== Early elections===\nGrow ran as a [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democrat]] in the [[1850 United States House of Representatives elections|1850 election]] and served as a member of that party during the [[32nd United States Congress|32nd]] and [[33rd United States Congress|33rd]] congresses, and into the [[34th United States Congress|34th Congress]]. He switched parties in the wake of President Pierce's signing of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]].<ref name=\"bio\"/> He ran as a [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] in the [[1856 United States House of Representatives elections|1856 election]] and remained a member of that party for the rest of his political career.\n\n=== Congressional Brawl of 1858 ===\nDuring the [[35th United States Congress]], on February 5, 1858, he was physically attacked by Democrat [[Laurence M. Keitt]] in the House chambers, leading to a brawl between northerners and southerners.  Keitt, offended by Grow's having stepped over to his side of the House chamber, dismissively demanded that Grow sit down, calling him a \"black Republican puppy\". Grow responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.\"  Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke [him] for that\". A large brawl involving approximately fifty representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice [[compounding]]; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form.

Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities.

The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the [[European Union]], and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15\u201320-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6\u201316-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, [[Uppsala University]], where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the [[University of Gothenburg]], and [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. In Sweden, pharmacists are called ''Apotekare''. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the [[University of Basel]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[ETH Zurich]]. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.  The [[University of the West Indies]] in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy.  Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]]. The role of regulatory and professional body on the [[Great Britain|mainland]] was previously carried out by the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], which remained as a professional body after handing over the regulatory role to the GPhC in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rpharms.com/about-us/history-of-the-society | title = History of the Society | work = Royal Pharmaceutical Society | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe following criteria must be met for qualification as a pharmacist in the United Kingdom (the Northern Irish body and the GPhC operate separately but have broadly similar registration requirements):<ref>{{cite web | publisher = General Pharmaceutical Council | url = http://pharmacyregulation.org/registration/registering-pharmacist | title = Registering as a Pharmacist | access-date = 18 January 2012}}</ref>\n*Successful completion of a 4-year [[Master of Pharmacy]] degree at a GPhC accredited university. Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment. Instead, relevant extracts of the British National Formulary will be provided within the assessment paper. \n*Satisfactorily meeting the GPhC's [[Fitness to practice|Fitness to Practice Standards]].\n\n===United States===\nIn 2014 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that there were 297,100 American pharmacist jobs.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy.

At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the [[University of Basel]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[ETH Zurich]]. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.  The [[University of the West Indies]] in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy.  Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]]. The role of regulatory and professional body on the [[Great Britain|mainland]] was previously carried out by the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], which remained as a professional body after handing over the regulatory role to the GPhC in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rpharms.com/about-us/history-of-the-society | title = History of the Society | work = Royal Pharmaceutical Society | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe following criteria must be met for qualification as a pharmacist in the United Kingdom (the Northern Irish body and the GPhC operate separately but have broadly similar registration requirements):<ref>{{cite web | publisher = General Pharmaceutical Council | url = http://pharmacyregulation.org/registration/registering-pharmacist | title = Registering as a Pharmacist | access-date = 18 January 2012}}</ref>\n*Successful completion of a 4-year [[Master of Pharmacy]] degree at a GPhC accredited university. Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment. Instead, relevant extracts of the British National Formulary will be provided within the assessment paper. \n*Satisfactorily meeting the GPhC's [[Fitness to practice|Fitness to Practice Standards]].\n\n===United States===\nIn 2014 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that there were 297,100 American pharmacist jobs.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor's degrees or 4-year bachelor's degrees.
