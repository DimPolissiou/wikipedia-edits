It became poor after 1865 and was a major site of racial tension, white supremacy, lynching, and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

In order of secession, they are South Carolina, Mississippi, [[Florida]], Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The first six states to secede were those that held the largest number of slaves.  Ultimately the Confederacy included eleven states.\n*A large part of the original [[Cotton Belt (region)|\"Cotton Belt\"]]. This was considered to extend from eastern [[North Carolina]] to South Carolina and through the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]] as far west as [[East Texas]], and including those parts of western [[Tennessee]] and eastern Arkansas in the [[Mississippi embayment]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">John Reed and Dale Volberg Reed, ''1001 Things Everyone Should Know About the South'',  Doubleday, 1996</ref> Some of this is coterminous with the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]], a term used for much of the Cotton Belt, which had a high percentage of African-American slave labor.\n* Studies of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] often highlight the region. Thus in 2012  political scientist Seth McKee concluded that in the 1964 presidential election, \"Once again, the high level of support for Goldwater in the Deep South, and especially their Black Belt counties, spoke to the enduring significance of white resistance to black progress.\" <ref>Seth C.

Up until that time, \"Lower South\" was the primary designation for those states. When \"Deep South\" first began to gain mainstream currency in print in the middle of the 20th century, it applied to the states and areas of Georgia, southern Alabama, northern Florida, Mississippi, north Louisiana, southern Arkansas and East Texas, all historic areas of cotton plantations and slavery.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Southern History''. Edited by David C. Roller and Robert W. Twyman. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1979</ref> This was the part of the South many considered the \"most Southern\".<ref> James C. Cobb, ''The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity'' (1992) p. vii.</ref>\n\nLater, the general definition expanded to include all of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and often taking in bordering areas of [[East Texas]] and [[North Florida]]. In its broadest application today, the Deep South is considered to be \"an area roughly coextensive with the old cotton belt from eastern [[North Carolina]] through South Carolina west into East Texas, with extensions north and south along the Mississippi\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Economics==\nAfter the Civil War, the region was poor. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, a small fraction of the white population comprised the wealthy landowners, merchants and bankers who controlled the economy and, largely, the politics. Most white farmers were poor and had to do manual work on their farms to survive. As prices fell, their work became harder and longer because of a change from largely self-sufficient farms, based on corn and pigs, to the growing of a cash crop of cotton or tobacco. Cotton cultivation took twice as many hours of work as raising corn. The farmers lost their freedom to determine what crops they would grow, ran into increasing indebtedness, and many were forced into tenancy or into working for someone else. There was some out-migration, especially to Texas, but generally the population grew relentlessly and the farms were subdivided smaller and smaller. Growing discontent helped give rise to the Populist movement around 1890. It represented a sort of class warfare, in which the poor farmers were the losers.<ref>Ted Ownby, \"The Defeated Generation at Work: White Farmers in the Deep South, 1865-1890.\" ''Southern Studies'' 23 (1984): 325-47.</ref><ref>Edward L.

In some areas, white migration increased into the South, especially dating from the late 20th century. Beginning with the [[1964 United States presidential election|Goldwater\u2013Johnson election]] of 1964, a significant contingent of white conservative voters in the Deep South stopped supporting national Democratic Party candidates and switched to Republicans. They still voted for many Democrats at the state and local level into the 1990s.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''The rise of southern Republicans'' (Harvard University Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party in the South had been crippled by the disenfranchisement of blacks, and the national party was unable to relieve their injustices in the South. During the [[Great Depression]] and the administration of Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], some [[New Deal Coalition|New Deal]] measures were promoted as intending to aid African Americans across the country and in the poor rural South, as well as poor whites. In the post-World War II era, Democratic Party presidents and national politicians began to support desegregation and other elements of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], from President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s desegregating the military, to [[John F. Kennedy]]'s support for non-violent protests.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, \"Harry Truman and the Election of 1948: The Coming of Age of Civil Rights in American Politics.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 37.4 (1971): 597-616</ref> These efforts culminated in [[Lyndon B.

Once [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] came to power [[1932 United States presidential election|in 1932]], however, the limited southern electorate found itself supporting Democratic candidates who frequently did not share its views. Journalist [[Matthew Yglesias]] argues:\n\n{{quote|The weird thing about Jim Crow politics is that white southerners with conservative views on taxes, moral values, and national security would vote for Democratic presidential candidates who didn't share their views.

In the Black Belt counties of the Deep South, racial polarization was practically complete. Negroes voted for Hubert Humphrey, whites for George Wallace. GOP nominee Nixon garnered very little backing and counties where Barry Goldwater had captured 90 percent to 100 percent of the vote in 1964.<ref> Phillips, p. 255 </ref>\n\nHistorian  [[Thomas Sugrue]] attributes the political and cultural changes, along with the easing of racial tensions, as the reason why southern voters began to vote for Republican national candidates, in line with their political ideology.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/its-not-dixies-fault/2015/07/17/7bf77a2e-2bd6-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html  Thomas J. Sugrue,  \"It's Not Dixie's Fault\"], ''The Washington Post'', 17 July 2015</ref> Since then, white Southern voters have voted for Republican candidates in every presidential election except in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 election]] when Georgia native [[Jimmy Carter]] received the Democratic nomination, the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]] when Carter won Georgia, the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 election]] when Arkansas native and former governor [[Bill Clinton]] won Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas, and the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]] when the incumbent president Clinton again won Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas. In 1995, Georgia Republican [[Newt Gingrich]] was elected by representatives of a Republican-dominated House as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].\n\nSince the 1990s the white majority has continued to shift toward Republican candidates at the state and local levels. This trend culminated in 2014 when the Republicans swept every statewide office in the region [[United States elections, 2014|midterm elections]].

Up until that time, \"Lower South\" was the primary designation for those states. When \"Deep South\" first began to gain mainstream currency in print in the middle of the 20th century, it applied to the states and areas of Georgia, southern Alabama, northern Florida, Mississippi, north Louisiana, southern Arkansas and East Texas, all historic areas of cotton plantations and slavery.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Southern History''. Edited by David C. Roller and Robert W. Twyman. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1979</ref> This was the part of the South many considered the \"most Southern\".<ref> James C. Cobb, ''The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity'' (1992) p. vii.</ref>\n\nLater, the general definition expanded to include all of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and often taking in bordering areas of [[East Texas]] and [[North Florida]]. In its broadest application today, the Deep South is considered to be \"an area roughly coextensive with the old cotton belt from eastern [[North Carolina]] through South Carolina west into East Texas, with extensions north and south along the Mississippi\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Economics==\nAfter the Civil War, the region was poor. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, a small fraction of the white population comprised the wealthy landowners, merchants and bankers who controlled the economy and, largely, the politics. Most white farmers were poor and had to do manual work on their farms to survive. As prices fell, their work became harder and longer because of a change from largely self-sufficient farms, based on corn and pigs, to the growing of a cash crop of cotton or tobacco. Cotton cultivation took twice as many hours of work as raising corn. The farmers lost their freedom to determine what crops they would grow, ran into increasing indebtedness, and many were forced into tenancy or into working for someone else. There was some out-migration, especially to Texas, but generally the population grew relentlessly and the farms were subdivided smaller and smaller. Growing discontent helped give rise to the Populist movement around 1890. It represented a sort of class warfare, in which the poor farmers were the losers.<ref>Ted Ownby, \"The Defeated Generation at Work: White Farmers in the Deep South, 1865-1890.\" ''Southern Studies'' 23 (1984): 325-47.</ref><ref>Edward L.

In some areas, white migration increased into the South, especially dating from the late 20th century. Beginning with the [[1964 United States presidential election|Goldwater\u2013Johnson election]] of 1964, a significant contingent of white conservative voters in the Deep South stopped supporting national Democratic Party candidates and switched to Republicans. They still voted for many Democrats at the state and local level into the 1990s.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''The rise of southern Republicans'' (Harvard University Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party in the South had been crippled by the disenfranchisement of blacks, and the national party was unable to relieve their injustices in the South. During the [[Great Depression]] and the administration of Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], some [[New Deal Coalition|New Deal]] measures were promoted as intending to aid African Americans across the country and in the poor rural South, as well as poor whites. In the post-World War II era, Democratic Party presidents and national politicians began to support desegregation and other elements of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], from President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s desegregating the military, to [[John F. Kennedy]]'s support for non-violent protests.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, \"Harry Truman and the Election of 1948: The Coming of Age of Civil Rights in American Politics.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 37.4 (1971): 597-616</ref> These efforts culminated in [[Lyndon B.

It's considered a \"minimally invasive\" surgery because the surgeon makes very small openings (incisions) at (or around) the belly button and lower portion of the belly. A thin telescope-like instrument (the laparoscope) is placed through one incision, which allows the doctor to look for endometriosis using a small camera attached to the laparoscope. Small instruments are inserted through the incisions to remove the endometriosis tissue and adhesions.

The blood accumulates locally if it is not cleared shortly by the immune, circulatory, and lymphatic system.

It's considered a \"minimally invasive\" surgery because the surgeon makes very small openings (incisions) at (or around) the belly button and lower portion of the belly. A thin telescope-like instrument (the laparoscope) is placed through one incision, which allows the doctor to look for endometriosis using a small camera attached to the laparoscope. Small instruments are inserted through the incisions to remove the endometriosis tissue and adhesions.

In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived.\n\nA literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was [[ennobled]] by the Duke of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]], in 1782 after taking up residence in [[Weimar]] in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774). He was an early participant in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's [[privy council]], sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby [[Ilmenau]], and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the [[University of Jena]]. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its [[Schloss Weimar|Ducal Palace]].<ref name=Weimar/>{{efn|In 1998, both of these sites, together with nine others, were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] under the name [[Classical Weimar (World Heritage Site)|Classical Weimar]].<ref name=Weimar>{{cite web|title= Classical Weimar UNESCO Justification|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/846|work= Justification for UNESCO Heritage Cites|publisher= UNESCO|accessdate= 7 June 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nGoethe's first major scientific work, the ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'', was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the [[playwright|dramatist]], historian, and philosopher [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''; the verse epic ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, [[Goethe's Faust|''Faust'']]. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[August Schlegel|August]] and [[Friedrich Schlegel]] have come to be collectively termed [[Weimar Classicism]].\n\nThe German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] named ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' one of the four greatest novels ever written,<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\"/>{{efn|The others Schopenhauer named were [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|''Tristram Shandy'']], [[Julie, or the New Heloise|''La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse'']], and ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite book |last = Schopenhauer |first = Arthur |title = The Art of Literature |work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | accessdate = 22 March 2015 |date = January 2004}}</ref>}} while the American philosopher and essayist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his [[Representative Men|work of the same name]] (along with [[Plato]], [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], [[Napoleon]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]).

Goethe also received lessons in dancing, [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[fencing]]. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.<ref name=Grimm36 />\n\nAlthough Goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and [[Homer]] were among his early favorites. He had a lively devotion to theater as well and was greatly fascinated by [[puppet]] shows that were annually arranged in his home; this is a recurrent theme in his literary work ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''.\n\nHe also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion. He writes about this period:\n{{Quotation|I had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the [[five books of Moses]], and then of the '[[Aeneid]]' and [[Ovid]]'s 'Metamorphoses'. ... If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.<ref>von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang.

He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of [[Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert]]. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Sch\u00f6nkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the [[Rococo]] genre. In 1770, he anonymously released ''Annette'', his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy ''Die Mitschuldigen''. The restaurant [[Auerbachs Keller]] and its legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Faust's]] 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his [[closet drama]] ''[[Faust Part One]]''. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.\n\nGoethe became severely ill in Frankfurt. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]].\n\nIn [[Alsace]], Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, Herder kindled his interest in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ossian]] and in the notion of ''Volkspoesie'' (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 Goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German \"Shakespeare Day\". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-duisburg-essen.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/goetheshak.htm |title=Originally speech of Goethe to the ''Shakespeare's Day'' by University Duisburg |publisher=Uni-duisburg-essen.de |date= |accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn a trip to the village [[Sessenheim]], Goethe fell in love with [[Friederike Brion]], in October 1770,<ref>Herman Grimm: ''Goethe.

Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make [[jurisprudence]] progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of [[Darmstadt]], where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and [[Johann Heinrich Merck]]. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a [[Nobility|noble]] [[highwayman]] from the [[German Peasants' War]]. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled ''[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]],'' the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.\n\nGoethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at [[Wetzlar]]. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.

(The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's&nbsp;26.) Goethe thus went to live in [[Weimar]], where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's friend and chief adviser.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Peter|last=Hume Brown|authorlink=Peter Hume Brown|title=Life of Goethe|year=1920|pages=224\u201325}}</ref><ref>[https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/uploads/tx_lombkswdigitaldocs/Jahrbuch_2007_Mueller.pdf \"Goethe und Carl August \u2013 Freundschaft und Politik\"] by Gerhard M\u00fcller, in Th.

The intimate bond with von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Stein, Charlotte von}}</ref>\n\nGoethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. In 1779, Goethe took on the War Commission of the Grand Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar]], in addition to the Mines and Highways commissions. In 1782, when the chancellor of the Duchy's Exchequer left his office, Goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the Duchy.<ref>{{Britannica|237027}}</ref> Goethe was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1782 (this being indicated by the \"[[von]]\" in his name).\n\nAs head of the Saxe-Weimar War Commission, Goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the Prussian and British military during the American Revolution.

His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical [[Ancient Greek art|art of ancient Greece]] and [[Roman art|Rome]]. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], as well as encountering such notable characters as [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] and [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] (see [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]).\n\nHe also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.\" While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.\n\nGoethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction ''[[Italian Journey]]''. ''Italian Journey'' only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in [[Venice]]. This \"gap in the record\" has been the source of much speculation over the years.\n\nIn the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, ''Italian Journey'' inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]''.\n\n=== Weimar ===\n[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|A Goethe watercolour depicting a [[liberty pole]] at the border to the short-lived [[Republic of Mainz]], created under influence of the French Revolution and destroyed in the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] in which Goethe participated]]\nIn late 1792, Goethe took part in the [[Battle of Valmy]] against [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], assisting Duke [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] of [[Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his ''Complete Works''.\n\nIn 1794, [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.\n\n[[File:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Goethe, by Luise Seidler (Weimar 1811)]]\n\nIn 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress [[Christiane Vulpius]], the sister of [[Christian August Vulpius|Christian A. Vulpius]], and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, [[Napoleon]]'s army invaded the town. The French \"spoon guards\", the least disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house: {{quote|The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: \"Fires, rapine, a frightful night... Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck.\" The luck was Goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.<ref>{{cite book|last=Safranski|first=R\u00fcdiger|title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 1990 |isbn= 978-0-674-79275-3}}</ref>}}\n\nDays afterward, on 19 October 1806, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the {{interlanguage link|Jakobskirche (Weimar)|de|lt=Jakobskirche in Weimar}}. They had already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (1789\u20131830), whose wife, [[Ottilie von Goethe|Ottilie von Pogwisch]] (1796\u20131872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832.

Goethe, now in his seventies, was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:\n\n{{quote|\"Musical prodigies&nbsp;... are probably no longer so rare; but what this little man can do in extemporizing and playing at sight borders the miraculous, and I could not have believed it possible at so early an age.\" \"And yet you heard Mozart in his seventh year at Frankfurt?\" said Zelter. \"Yes\", answered Goethe, \"...&nbsp;but what your pupil already accomplishes, bears the same relation to the Mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown-up person bears to the prattle of a child.\"{{sfn|Todd|2003|p=89}}}}\n\nMendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions,{{sfn|Mercer-Taylor|2000|pp=41\u201342, 93}} and set a number of Goethe's poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture ''[[Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage (Mendelssohn)|Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage]]'' (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht]]'' (''The First Walpurgis Night'', Op. 60, 1832).{{sfn|Todd|2003|pp=188\u201390, 269\u201370}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:S\u00e4rge Goethe und Schiller.jpg|thumb|Coffins of Goethe and Schiller, Weimar vault]]\nIn 1832, Goethe died in [[Weimar]] of apparent heart failure.

Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode.

Indeed, ''Werther'' is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"[[Bestseller#Early_best_sellers|best-seller]].\"  During the years at Weimar before he met [[Schiller]] he began ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', wrote the dramas ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie auf Tauris]]'' (''Iphigenia in Tauris''), ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'', ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]'', and the fable ''[[Reineke Fuchs]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nTo the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (the continuation of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''), the [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]] '' and the verse drama ''[[The Natural Daughter]]''. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared ''[[Faust Part One]]'', ''[[Elective Affinities]]'', the ''[[West\u2013\u00f6stlicher Divan|West-Eastern Diwan]]'' (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of [[Hafez]]), his autobiographical ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' (''From My Life: Poetry and Truth'') which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', and a series of treatises on art.

Goethe admitted that he \"shot his hero to save himself\": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary [[archetype]]. The fact that ''Werther'' ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral\u2014a funeral which \"no clergyman attended\"\u2014made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide is considered sinful by [[Christian doctrine]]: suicides were denied [[Christian burial]] with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|publisher=Pips Project|title=The Stigma of Suicide \u2013 A history|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120251/http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|archivedate=6 October 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}</ref> However, Goethe explained his use of ''Werther'' in his autobiography.

What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.\n\nThe next work, his epic [[closet drama]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', was completed in stages. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. Goethe finished ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously. Goethe's original draft of a Faust play, which probably dates from 1773\u201374, and is now known as the ''Urfaust'', was also published after his death.<ref>''Goethe's Plays, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'', translated into English with introductions by Charles E.

The work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Gounod]], [[Boito]], [[Busoni]], and [[Schnittke]] as well as symphonic works by [[Liszt]], [[Wagner]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. Faust became the [[wikt:ur-|ur-myth]] of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the [[world premiere]] complete production of Faust was staged at the [[Goetheanum]].\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Goethe in the Roman Campagna'' (1786) by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|Tischbein]]]]\n\nGoethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed ''Innerlichkeit'' (\"introversion\") and represented by, for example, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]].

Perhaps the single most influential piece is \"Mignon's Song\" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: \"''{{lang|de|Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen bl\u00fchn}}''?\" (\"Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?\").\n\nHe is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as \"Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him\", \"[[Divide and rule]], a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one\", and \"Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must\", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from ''Faust'', such as \"{{lang|de|Das also war des Pudels Kern}}\", \"{{lang|de|Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss}}\", or \"{{lang|de|Grau ist alle Theorie}}\" have entered everyday German usage.\n\nSome well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to Goethe. These include [[Hippocrates]]' \"Art is long, life is short\", which is echoed in Goethe's ''Faust'' and ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''.\n\n== Scientific work ==\n{{See also|Goethean science}}\n{{Quotation|As to what I have done as a poet,...

In it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium.<ref>Aristotle [https://archive.org/details/aristotledesensu00arisuoft/page/57 <!-- quote=aristotle + \"de sensu\" + white and black may be juxtaposed\". --> wrote] that colour is a mixture of light and dark, since white light is always seen as somewhat darkened when it is seen as a colour. (Aristotle, ''On Sense and its Objects'', III, 439b, 20 ff.: \"White and black may be juxtaposed in such a way that by the minuteness of the division of its parts each is invisible while their product is visible, and thus colour may be produced.\")</ref> In 1816, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] went on to develop his own theory in ''[[On&nbsp;Vision and Colors|On Vision and Colours]]'' based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book.

Goethe was vehemently opposed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive ''rational description'' of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye.

But this applies not only to Goethe; quite a number of his friends, who later became more or less well-known as poets, paid homage to pantheism in their youth, and this doctrine flourished actively in German art before it attained supremacy among us as a philosophic theory.\" (''Concerning the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany'', 1833\u201336) [Translated from the German by Helen Mustard, edited by Jost Hermand and Robert C.

It is true that he was all his life a follower of Spinoza, and that he may be termed, without hesitation, a naturalist in philosophy and a pantheist. His adherence to the general attitude of Spinoza, however, did not exclude a great plasticity and freedom in his own views, even on the most fundamental points. Thus Goethe did not admit the mechanical interpretation of nature advocated by Spinoza.

Convinced of the oneness of nature, he approached it with a certainty to discover in it oneness, and his discovery of the os intermaxtllare in man, which influenced the development of comparative anatomy, is one of the by-products of his Spinozistic sentiments. In his theory of the metamorphosis of the plants, which he expounded scientifically and poetically, he also expressed a good deal of Spinozism. Spinoza enabled him to read the various pages of nature as one book. Goethe respected Kant and may be described as a Kant scholar, but he was a Spinoza adherent.

He would argue that [[Classicism]] was the means of controlling art, and that [[Romanticism]] was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. [[Beethoven]] declared that a \"Faust\" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. [[Liszt]] and [[Mahler]] both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this [[Social influence|seminal]] work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]].\n[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|Second [[Goetheanum]]]] [[File:Mendelssohn plays to Goethe, 1830.jpg|thumb|Mendelssohn plays to Goethe, 1830: painting by [[Moritz Oppenheim]], 1864]]\nThe ''Faust'' tragedy/drama, often called ''{{lang|de|'''Das''' Drama der Deutschen}}'' ('''the''' drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation.

In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived.\n\nA literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was [[ennobled]] by the Duke of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]], in 1782 after taking up residence in [[Weimar]] in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774). He was an early participant in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's [[privy council]], sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby [[Ilmenau]], and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the [[University of Jena]]. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its [[Schloss Weimar|Ducal Palace]].<ref name=Weimar/>{{efn|In 1998, both of these sites, together with nine others, were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] under the name [[Classical Weimar (World Heritage Site)|Classical Weimar]].<ref name=Weimar>{{cite web|title= Classical Weimar UNESCO Justification|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/846|work= Justification for UNESCO Heritage Cites|publisher= UNESCO|accessdate= 7 June 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nGoethe's first major scientific work, the ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'', was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the [[playwright|dramatist]], historian, and philosopher [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''; the verse epic ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, [[Goethe's Faust|''Faust'']]. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[August Schlegel|August]] and [[Friedrich Schlegel]] have come to be collectively termed [[Weimar Classicism]].\n\nThe German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] named ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' one of the four greatest novels ever written,<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\"/>{{efn|The others Schopenhauer named were [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|''Tristram Shandy'']], [[Julie, or the New Heloise|''La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse'']], and ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite book |last = Schopenhauer |first = Arthur |title = The Art of Literature |work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | accessdate = 22 March 2015 |date = January 2004}}</ref>}} while the American philosopher and essayist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his [[Representative Men|work of the same name]] (along with [[Plato]], [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], [[Napoleon]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably [[Johann Peter Eckermann]]'s ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]'' (1836).\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early life ===\nGoethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house (today the [[Goethe House]]) in [[Frankfurt]], then an [[Imperial Free City]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Though he had studied law in Leipzig and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs.<ref name=Grimm36>[[Herman Grimm]]: ''Goethe.

Goethe also received lessons in dancing, [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[fencing]]. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.<ref name=Grimm36 />\n\nAlthough Goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and [[Homer]] were among his early favorites. He had a lively devotion to theater as well and was greatly fascinated by [[puppet]] shows that were annually arranged in his home; this is a recurrent theme in his literary work ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''.\n\nHe also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion. He writes about this period:\n{{Quotation|I had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the [[five books of Moses]], and then of the '[[Aeneid]]' and [[Ovid]]'s 'Metamorphoses'. ... If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.<ref>von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang. ''The Autobiography of Goethe: truth and poetry, from my own life, Volume&nbsp;1'' (1897), translated by John Oxenford, pp. 114, 129</ref>}}\n\nGoethe became also acquainted with Frankfurt actors.<ref>{{interlanguage link|Valerian Tornius|de}}: ''Goethe \u2013 Leben, Wirken und Schaffen''.

He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of [[Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert]]. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Sch\u00f6nkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the [[Rococo]] genre. In 1770, he anonymously released ''Annette'', his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy ''Die Mitschuldigen''. The restaurant [[Auerbachs Keller]] and its legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Faust's]] 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his [[closet drama]] ''[[Faust Part One]]''. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.\n\nGoethe became severely ill in Frankfurt. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]].\n\nIn [[Alsace]], Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, Herder kindled his interest in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ossian]] and in the notion of ''Volkspoesie'' (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 Goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German \"Shakespeare Day\". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-duisburg-essen.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/goetheshak.htm |title=Originally speech of Goethe to the ''Shakespeare's Day'' by University Duisburg |publisher=Uni-duisburg-essen.de |date= |accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn a trip to the village [[Sessenheim]], Goethe fell in love with [[Friederike Brion]], in October 1770,<ref>Herman Grimm: ''Goethe.

Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make [[jurisprudence]] progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of [[Darmstadt]], where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and [[Johann Heinrich Merck]]. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a [[Nobility|noble]] [[highwayman]] from the [[German Peasants' War]]. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled ''[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]],'' the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.\n\nGoethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at [[Wetzlar]]. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with [[Charlotte Buff]] (1753\u20131828)<ref name=\"KestnerAndLotte\">Mandelkow, Karl Robert (1962).

(The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's&nbsp;26.) Goethe thus went to live in [[Weimar]], where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's friend and chief adviser.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Peter|last=Hume Brown|authorlink=Peter Hume Brown|title=Life of Goethe|year=1920|pages=224\u201325}}</ref><ref>[https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/uploads/tx_lombkswdigitaldocs/Jahrbuch_2007_Mueller.pdf \"Goethe und Carl August \u2013 Freundschaft und Politik\"] by Gerhard M\u00fcller, in Th.

The intimate bond with von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Stein, Charlotte von}}</ref>\n\nGoethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. In 1779, Goethe took on the War Commission of the Grand Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar]], in addition to the Mines and Highways commissions. In 1782, when the chancellor of the Duchy's Exchequer left his office, Goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the Duchy.<ref>{{Britannica|237027}}</ref> Goethe was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1782 (this being indicated by the \"[[von]]\" in his name).\n\nAs head of the Saxe-Weimar War Commission, Goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the Prussian and British military during the American Revolution.  The author {{interlanguage link|W. Daniel Wilson|de|lt=W.

His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical [[Ancient Greek art|art of ancient Greece]] and [[Roman art|Rome]]. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], as well as encountering such notable characters as [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] and [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] (see [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]).\n\nHe also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.\" While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.\n\nGoethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction ''[[Italian Journey]]''. ''Italian Journey'' only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in [[Venice]]. This \"gap in the record\" has been the source of much speculation over the years.\n\nIn the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, ''Italian Journey'' inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]''.\n\n=== Weimar ===\n[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|A Goethe watercolour depicting a [[liberty pole]] at the border to the short-lived [[Republic of Mainz]], created under influence of the French Revolution and destroyed in the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] in which Goethe participated]]\nIn late 1792, Goethe took part in the [[Battle of Valmy]] against [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], assisting Duke [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] of [[Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his ''Complete Works''.\n\nIn 1794, [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.\n\n[[File:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Goethe, by Luise Seidler (Weimar 1811)]]\n\nIn 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress [[Christiane Vulpius]], the sister of [[Christian August Vulpius|Christian A. Vulpius]], and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, [[Napoleon]]'s army invaded the town. The French \"spoon guards\", the least disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house: {{quote|The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work.

I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode.

Indeed, ''Werther'' is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller.\"  During the years at Weimar before he met [[Schiller]] he began ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', wrote the dramas ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie auf Tauris]]'' (''Iphigenia in Tauris''), ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'', ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]'', and the fable ''[[Reineke Fuchs]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nTo the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (the continuation of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''), the [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]] '' and the verse drama ''[[The Natural Daughter]]''. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared ''[[Faust Part One]]'', ''[[Elective Affinities]]'', the ''[[West\u2013\u00f6stlicher Divan|West-Eastern Diwan]]'' (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of [[Hafez]]), his autobiographical ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' (''From My Life: Poetry and Truth'') which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', and a series of treatises on art.

Goethe admitted that he \"shot his hero to save himself\": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary [[archetype]]. The fact that ''Werther'' ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral\u2014a funeral which \"no clergyman attended\"\u2014made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide is considered sinful by [[Christian doctrine]]: suicides were denied [[Christian burial]] with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|publisher=Pips Project|title=The Stigma of Suicide \u2013 A history|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120251/http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|archivedate=6 October 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}</ref> However, Goethe explained his use of ''Werther'' in his autobiography.

G. Bohn|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.\n\nThe next work, his epic [[closet drama]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', was completed in stages. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. Goethe finished ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously. Goethe's original draft of a Faust play, which probably dates from 1773\u201374, and is now known as the ''Urfaust'', was also published after his death.<ref>''Goethe's Plays, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'', translated into English with introductions by Charles E.

The work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Gounod]], [[Boito]], [[Busoni]], and [[Schnittke]] as well as symphonic works by [[Liszt]], [[Wagner]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. Faust became the [[wikt:ur-|ur-myth]] of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the [[world premiere]] complete production of Faust was staged at the [[Goetheanum]].\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Goethe in the Roman Campagna'' (1786) by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|Tischbein]]]]\n\nGoethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed ''Innerlichkeit'' (\"introversion\") and represented by, for example, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]].

Perhaps the single most influential piece is \"Mignon's Song\" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: \"''{{lang|de|Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen bl\u00fchn}}''?\" (\"Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?\").\n\nHe is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as \"Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him\", \"[[Divide and rule]], a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one\", and \"Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must\", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from ''Faust'', such as \"{{lang|de|Das also war des Pudels Kern}}\", \"{{lang|de|Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss}}\", or \"{{lang|de|Grau ist alle Theorie}}\" have entered everyday German usage.\n\nSome well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to Goethe.

Goethe was vehemently opposed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive ''rational description'' of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye.

This mind, which had worked upon me thus decisively, and which was destined to affect so deeply my whole mode of thinking, was Spinoza. After looking through the world in vain, to find a means of development for my strange nature, I at last fell upon the ''Ethics'' of this philosopher. Of what I read out of the work, and of what I read into it, I can give no account. Enough that I found in it a sedative for my passions, and that a free, wide view over the sensible and moral world, seemed to open before me.

I don't remember now where I read that [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] once exploded peevishly at the constant preoccupation with Spinoza, 'If Goethe would only for once pick up some other Latin book than Spinoza!' But this applies not only to Goethe; quite a number of his friends, who later became more or less well-known as poets, paid homage to pantheism in their youth, and this doctrine flourished actively in German art before it attained supremacy among us as a philosophic theory.\" (''Concerning the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany'', 1833\u201336) [Translated from the German by Helen Mustard, edited by Jost Hermand and Robert C.

His adherence to the general attitude of Spinoza, however, did not exclude a great plasticity and freedom in his own views, even on the most fundamental points.

In his theory of the metamorphosis of the plants, which he expounded scientifically and poetically, he also expressed a good deal of Spinozism.

It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of aquaculture including breeding, genetics, biotechnology, nutrition, farming, diagnosis of diseases in fishes, other aquatic resources, medical treatment of aquatic animals; fish processing including curing, canning, freezing, value addition, byproducts and waste utilization, quality assurance and certification, fisheries microbiology, fisheries biochemistry; fisheries resource management including biology, anatomy, taxonomy, physiology, population dynamics; fisheries environment including oceanography, limnology, ecology, biodiversity, aquatic pollution; fishing technology including gear and craft engineering, navigation and seamanship, marine engines; fisheries economics and management and fisheries extension. Fisheries science is generally a 4-year course typically taught in a university setting, and can be the focus of an undergraduate, postgraduate or Ph.D. program.
