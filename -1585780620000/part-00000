The ''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]]'', his most well known text, passionately defends the morality of the Christian life, and provides various ethical and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments to convince the Roman emperor, [[Antoninus Pius|Antoninus]], to abandon the persecution of the Church. Further, he also indicates, as St. Augustine would later regarding the \"true religion\" that predated Christianity,<ref>\"The very thing which is now called the Christian religion existed among the ancients also, nor was it wanting from the inception of the human race until the coming of Christ in the flesh, at which point the true religion which was already in existence began to be called Christian.\" \u2013 St. Augustine, Retractiones</ref> that the \"seeds of Christianity\" (manifestations of the [[Logos (Christianity) | Logos]] acting in history) actually predated Christ's [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. This notion allows him to claim many historical Greek philosophers (including [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]), in whose works he was well studied, as [[Virtuous pagan|unknowing Christians]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Engraving of Justin Martyr - 2.jpg|thumb|right|A bearded Justin Martyr presenting an open book to a Roman emperor.

He says he tried first the school of a [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, who was unable to explain God's being to him. He then attended a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher but was put off because the philosopher was too eager for his fee. Then he went to hear a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher who demanded that he first learn music, astronomy, and geometry, which he did not wish to do. Subsequently, he adopted [[Platonism]] after encountering a Platonist thinker who had recently settled in his city. \n\n{{Quote|And the perception of immaterial things quite overpowered me, and the contemplation of ideas furnished my mind with wings, so that in a little while I supposed that I had become wise; and such was my stupidity, I expected forthwith to look upon God, for this is the end of Plato's philosophy.<ref name=Dialogue />}}\n\nSome time afterwards, he chanced upon an old man, possibly a Syrian Christian,<ref>Oskar Skarsaune, ''The proof from prophecy: a study in Justin Martyr's proof-text tradition:text-type, provenance, theological profile,'' Brill, 1987 p.246.</ref> in the vicinity of the seashore, who engaged him in a dialogue about God and spoke of the testimony of the prophets as being more reliable than the reasoning of philosophers.\n\n{{Quote|There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man, not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things, and of those matters which the philosopher ought to know, provided he has believed them. For they did not use demonstration in their treatises, seeing that they were witnesses to the truth above all demonstration, and worthy of belief; and those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them, although, indeed, they were entitled to credit on account of the miracles which they performed, since they both glorified the Creator, the God and Father of all things, and proclaimed His Son, the Christ [sent] by Him: which, indeed, the false prophets, who are filled with the lying unclean spirit, neither have done nor do, but venture to work certain wonderful deeds for the purpose of astonishing men, and glorify the spirits and demons of error. But pray that, above all things, the gates of light may be opened to you; for these things cannot be perceived or understood by all, but only by the man to whom God and His Christ have imparted wisdom.<ref name=Dialogue />}}\n\nMoved by the aged man's argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of the Divine. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the [[martyr]]s, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the \"true philosophy.\"  His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus<ref name=\"J. Quasten, p.196-7\">J.

During the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138\u2013161), he arrived in [[Rome]] and started his own school.  [[Tatian]] was one of his pupils.<ref>Marian Hillar, ''From Logos to Trinity: The Evolution of Religious Beliefs from Pythagoras to Tertullian'', page 139 (Cambridge University Press, 2012). {{ISBN|978-1-107-01330-8}}</ref> In the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], after disputing with the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] philosopher [[Crescens the Cynic|Crescens]], he was denounced by the latter to the authorities, according to Tatian (Address to the Greeks 19) and Eusebius (HE IV 16.7\u20138).  Justin was tried, together with six companions, by [[Junius Rusticus]], who was urban prefect from 163\u2013167, and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]]. Though the precise year of his death is uncertain, it can reasonably be dated by the prefectoral term of Rusticus (who governed from 162 and 168). The martyrdom of Justin preserves the court record of the trial.<ref name=\"J. Quasten, p.196-7\"/>\n\n{{Quote|The Prefect Rusticus says: Approach and sacrifice, all of you, to the gods. Justin says: No one in his right mind gives up piety for impiety. The Prefect Rusticus says: If you do not obey, you will be tortured without mercy. Justin replies: That is our desire, to be tortured for Our Lord, Jesus Christ, and so to be saved, for that will give us salvation and firm confidence at the more terrible universal tribunal of Our Lord and Saviour. And all the martyrs said: Do as you wish; for we are Christians, and we do not sacrifice to idols. The Prefect Rusticus read the sentence: Those who do not wish to sacrifice to the gods and to obey the emperor will be scourged and beheaded according to the laws. The holy martyrs glorifying God betook themselves to the customary place, where they were beheaded and consummated their martyrdom confessing their Saviour.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>}}\n\nThe church of St. John the Baptist in [[Sacrofano]], a few miles north of Rome, claims to have his relics.<ref>''Sacrofano \u2013 Church of Saint John the Baptist'', \"...the bones of St. Justin are preserved in a great urn under the coloured marble high altar, built in 1515.\" [http://en.tesorintornoroma.it/Itinerari/La-Via-Flaminia/Sacrofano-Chiesa-di-San-Giovanni-Battista] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313042048/http://en.tesorintornoroma.it/Itinerari/La-Via-Flaminia/Sacrofano-Chiesa-di-San-Giovanni-Battista |date=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of the Jesuits]] in Valletta, Malta, founded by papal decree in 1592 also boasts relics of this second century Saint.<ref>Wikipedia article on Church of the Jesuits.</ref>\n\nA case is also made that the relics of St. Justin are buried in Annapolis, Maryland. During a period of unrest in Italy, a noble family in possession of his remains sent them in 1873 to a priest in Baltimore for safekeeping. They were displayed in St. Mary's Church for a period of time before they were again locked away for safekeeping. The remains were rediscovered and given a proper burial at St. Mary's, with Vatican approval, in 1989.<ref>https://www.apnews.com/88ec7a380363c0411c2a84b706f090fe</ref>\n\n[[File:S.

[[Irenaeus]]<ref>''Haer.'' I., xxviii. 1.</ref> speaks of Justin's martyrdom and of Tatian as his disciple. Irenaeus quotes Justin twice<ref>IV., vi. 2, V., xxvi. 2.</ref> and shows his influence in other places.  [[Tertullian]], in his ''[[Adversus Valentinianos]]'', calls Justin a philosopher and a martyr and the earliest antagonist of [[Christian heresy|heretics]]. [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Methodius of Olympus]] also mention or quote him.  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] deals with him at some length,<ref>''Church History'', iv. 18.</ref> and names the following works:\n# The ''[[First Apology]]'' addressed to [[Antoninus Pius]], his sons, and the Roman Senate;<ref>David Rok\u00e9ah, ''Justin Martyr and the Jews'', page 2 (Leiden, Brill, 2002). {{ISBN|90-04-12310-5}}</ref>\n# a ''[[Second Apology of Justin Martyr]]'' addressed to the Roman Senate;\n# the ''Discourse to the Greeks'', a discussion with Greek philosophers on the character of their gods;\n# an ''[[Exhortation to the Greeks|Hortatory Address to the Greeks]]'' (known now not to have been written by Justin<ref>Hardwick, Michael, \"''Contra Apionem'' and ''Antiquatates Judaicae'': Points of Contact\" in [[Louis Feldman|Feldman, Louis H.]] and Levison, John R.

The ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'' assigns his martyrdom to the year 165. A considerable number of other works are given as Justin's by Arethas, Photius, and other writers, but this attribution is now generally admitted to be spurious. The ''Expositio rectae fidei'' has been assigned by Draseke to Apollinaris of Laodicea, but it is probably a work of as late as the 6th century. The ''[[Exhortation to the Greeks|Cohortatio ad Graecos]]'' has been attributed to Apollinaris of Laodicea, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, as well as others. The ''Epistola ad Zenam et Serenum'', an exhortation to Christian living, is dependent upon [[Clement of Alexandria]], and is assigned by [[Pierre Batiffol]] to the Novatian Bishop [[Sisinnius I of Constantinople|Sisinnius]] (c. 400). The extant work under the title \"On the Sovereignty of God\" does not correspond with Eusebius' description of it, though Harnack regards it as still possibly Justin's, and at least of the 2nd century. The author of the smaller treatise ''To the Greeks'' cannot be Justin, because he is dependent on Tatian; Harnack places it between 180 and 240.\n\n===Dialogue with Trypho===\nThe ''Dialogue'' is a later work than the ''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]]''; the date of composition of the latter, judging from the fact that it was addressed to [[Antoninus Pius]] and his adopted sons [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]], must fall between 147 and 161.\n\nIn the ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', after an introductory section, Justin undertakes to show that Christianity is the new law for all men.\n\n===''On The Resurrection''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe treatise ''On the Resurrection'' exists in extensive fragments that are preserved in the ''Sacra parallela''. The fragments begin with the assertion that the truth, and God the author of truth, need no witness, but that as a concession to the weakness of men it is necessary to give arguments to convince those who gainsay it. It is then shown, after a denial of unfounded deductions, that the resurrection of the body is neither impossible nor unworthy of God, and that the evidence of prophecy is not lacking for it. Another fragment takes up the positive proof of the resurrection, adducing that of Christ and of those whom he recalled to life. In yet another fragment the resurrection is shown to be that of what has gone down, i.e., the body; the knowledge concerning it is the new doctrine, in contrast to that of the old philosophers. The doctrine [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the command to keep the body in moral purity.\n\nThe authenticity of the treatise is not so generally accepted as are Justin's other works. Even so, earlier than the ''Sacra parallela'', it is referred to by Procopius of Gaza (c. 465\u2013528).  Methodius appeals to Justin in support of his interpretation of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 15:50 in a way that makes it natural to assume the existence of a treatise on the subject, to say nothing of other traces of a connection in thought both here in Irenaeus (V., ii.-xiii. 5) and in Tertullian, where it is too close to be anything but a conscious following of the Greek. The ''Against Marcion'' is lost, as is the ''Refutation of all Heresies'' to which Justin himself refers in ''Apology'', i. 26; [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], besides perhaps Irenaeus and Tertullian, seems to have used it.\n\n==Role within the Church==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n[[Flacius]] discovered \"blemishes\" in Justin's theology, which he attributed to the influence of pagan philosophers; and in modern times [[Johann Salomo Semler|Semler]] and S.G. Lange have made him out a thorough Hellene, while Semisch and Otto defend him from this charge.\n\nIn opposition to the school of [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]], who considered him a Jewish Christian, [[Albrecht Ritschl]] has pointed out that it was precisely because he was a Gentile Christian that he did not fully understand the [[Old Testament]] foundation of Paul's teaching, and explained in this way the modified character of his Paulinism and his legal mode of thought.\n\nM. von Engelhardt has attempted to extend this line of treatment to Justin's entire theology, and to show that his conceptions of God, of free will and righteousness, of redemption, grace, and merit prove the influence of the cultivated Greek pagan world of the 2nd century, dominated by the Platonic and Stoic philosophy.\n\nBut he admits that Justin is a Christian in his unquestioning adherence to the Church and its faith, his unqualified recognition of the Old Testament, and his faith in Christ as the Son of God the Creator, made manifest in the flesh, crucified, and risen, through which belief he succeeds in getting away from the dualism of both pagan and Gnostic philosophy.\n\nJustin was confident that his teaching was that of the Church at large. He knows of a division among the orthodox only on the question of the [[millennialism|millennium]] and on the attitude toward the milder Jewish Christianity, which he personally is willing to tolerate as long as its professors in their turn do not interfere with the liberty of the Gentile converts; his [[millenarianism]] seems to have no connection with [[Judaism]], but he believes firmly in a millennium, and generally in the Christian [[eschatology]].\n\nAfter collaborating with a Jewish convert to assist him with Hebrew, Justin published an attack on Judaism based upon a no-longer-extant text of a [[Midrash]]. This Midrash was reconstructed and published by [[Saul Lieberman]].\n\nOpposition to Judaism was common among church leaders in his day, however Justin Martyr was hostile towards Jewry and regarded Jews as an accursed people. His anti-Judaic polemics have been cited as an origin of Christian antisemitism,<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Early_Church.html</ref> he was the first to argue that the Romans bore no responsibility for the death of Jesus, supporting the idea of [[Jewish deicide]]. However his views elaborated in the ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' were comparatively tame to those of [[John Chrysostom]] and others.\n\n== Christology ==\nJustin, like others, thought that the Greek philosophers had derived, if not borrowed, the most essential elements of truth found in their teaching from the [[Old Testament]]. But at the same time he adopted the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of the \"seminal word,\" and so philosophy was to him an operation of the Word\u2014in fact, through his identification of the Word with [[Christ]], it was brought into immediate connection with him.<ref name=NSH_284>New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge 3rd ed. 1914. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc06/Page_284.html Pg 284][Exact Quote]</ref>\n\nThus he does not scruple to declare that [[Socrates]] and [[Heraclitus]] were Christians (''Apol.'', i. 46, ii. 10). His aim was to emphasize the absolute significance of Christ, so that all that ever existed of virtue and truth may be referred to him. The old philosophers and law-givers had only a part of the [[Logos]], while the whole appears in Christ.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nWhile the gentile peoples, seduced by devils, had deserted the true God for idols, the Jews and Samaritans possessed the revelation given through the prophets and awaited the [[Messiah]]. However, the law, while containing commandments intended to promote the true fear of God, had other prescriptions of a purely pedagogic nature, which necessarily ceased when Christ, their end, appeared; of such temporary and merely relative regulations were [[circumcision]], animal sacrifices, the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], and the laws as to food. Through Christ, the abiding law of God has been fully proclaimed. In his character, as the teacher of the new doctrine and promulgator of the new law, lies the essential nature of his redeeming work.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nThe idea of an economy of grace, of a restoration of the union with God which had been destroyed by sin, is not foreign to him. It is noteworthy that in the \"Dialogue\" he no longer speaks of a \"seed of the Word\" in every man, and in his non-apologetic works the emphasis is laid upon the redeeming acts of the life of Christ rather than upon the demonstration of the reasonableness and moral value of Christianity, though the fragmentary character of the latter works makes it difficult to determine exactly to what extent this is true and how far the teaching of [[Irenaeus]] on redemption is derived from him.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nThe 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' notes that scholars have differed on whether Justin's writings on the nature of God were meant to express his firm opinion on points of doctrine, or to speculate on these matters.  Specific points Justin addressed include that the Logos is \"numerically distinct from the Father\" though \"born of the very substance of the Father,\" and that \"through the Word, God has made everything.\"  Justin used the metaphor of fire to describe the Logos as spreading like a flame, rather than \"dividing\" the substance of the Father.  He also defended the Holy Spirit as a member of the Trinity, as well as the birth of Jesus to Mary when she was a virgin.  The Encyclopedia states that Justin places the genesis of the Logos as a voluntary act of the Father at the beginning of creation, noting that this is an \"unfortunate\" conflict with later Christian teachings.<ref name=OCE_martyr>{{catholic | last = Lebreton |first = Jules | title = St. Justin Martyr|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08580c.htm | volume = 7|inline=yes|accessdate=2 November 2013|prescript=}} <p> The Word is numerically distinct from the Father (Dial., cxxviii, cxxix; cf. lvi, lxii). He was born of the very substance of the Father, not that this substance was divided, but He proceeds from it as one fire does from another at which it is lit (cxxviii, lxi); this form of production (procession) is compared also with that of human speech (lxi). The Word (Logos) is therefore the Son: much more, He alone may properly be called Son (II Apol., vi, 3); He is the monogenes, the unigenitus (Dial., cv). Elsewhere, however, Justin, like St. Paul, calls Him the eldest Son, prototokos (I Apol., xxxiii; xlvi; lxiii; Dial., lxxxiv, lxxxv, cxxv). The Word is God (I Apol., lxiii; Dial., xxxiv, xxxvi, xxxvii, lvi, lxiii, lxxvi, lxxxvi, lxxxvii, cxiii, cxv, cxxv, cxxvi, cxviii). His Divinity, however, seems subordinate, as does the worship which is rendered to Him (I Apol., vi; cf. lxi, 13; Teder, \"Justins des M\u00e4rtyrers Lehre von Jesus Christus\", Freiburg im Br., 1906, 103\u201319). The Father engendered Him by a free and voluntary act (Dial., lxi, c, cxxvii, cxxviii; cf. Teder, op. cit., 104), at the beginning of all His works (Dial., lxi, lxii, II Apol., vi, 3); in this last text certain authors thought they distinguished in the Word two states of being, one intimate, the other outspoken, but this distinction, though found in some other apologists, is in Justin very doubtful. Through the Word God has made everything (II Apol., vi; Dial., cxiv). The Word is diffused through all humanity (I Apol., vi; II, viii; xiii); it was He who appeared to the patriarchs (I Apol., lxii; lxiii; Dial., lvi, lix, lx etc.). Two influences are plainly discernible in the aforesaid body of doctrine. It is, of course, to Christian revelation that Justin owes his concept of the distinct personality of the Word, His Divinity and Incarnation; but philosophic speculation is responsible for his unfortunate concepts of the temporal and voluntary generation of the Word, and for the subordinationism of Justin's theology. It must be recognized, moreover, that the latter ideas stand out more boldly in the \"Apology\" than in the \"Dialogue.\"</ref>\n<!--End Exact Quote-->\n\n== Memoirs of the apostles ==\nJustin Martyr, in his [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|''First Apology'']] (c. 155) and ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' (c. 160),<ref name=\"Rokeah 2002 p. 2\">Rokeah (2002) ''Justin Martyr and the Jews'' p.&nbsp;2 \u2013 His ''First Apology'' dates from about 155 CE, for it mentions (chap. 29) the procurator of Egypt, Felix, who served in this capacity between 151 and 154.

The single passage where Justin uses both terms (''1 Apol.'' 66.3) makes it clear that \"memoirs of the apostles\" and \"gospels\" are equivalent, and the use of the plural indicates Justin's awareness of more than one written gospel.

Scholar [[David E. Aune]] has argued that the gospels were modeled after classical [[Greco-Roman]] biographies, and Justin's use of the term ''apomnemoneumata'' to mean all the [[Synoptic Gospels]] should be understood as referring to a written biography such as the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia of Xenophon]]'' because they preserve the authentic teachings of Jesus.<ref name=\"Aune 1987 p. 67\">Aune (1987) ''The New Testament in its Literary Environment'' p.&nbsp;67 \u2013 \"Justin Martyr (writing ca. 155) described the Gospels as 'reminiscences [apomnemoneumata] of the apostles' (1 Apology 66.3; 67.3) and 'reminiscences of Peter' (Dialogue with Trypho 106.3). Thus Justin, like Matthew, Luke, and Papias, prefers to designate the Gospels by a recognized literary form.  Though ''apomnemoneumata'' are not carefully defined in rhetorical handbooks, they are essentially expanded chreiai, i.e., sayings and/or actions of or about specific individuals, set in a narrative framework and transmitted by ''memory'' (hence \"reliable\").&nbsp;... His use of the term \"reminiscences\", therefore, suggests a connection to Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'' (in Greek ''apomnemoneumata''), a \"biography\" of Socrates.\"</ref>  However, scholar [[Helmut Koester]] has pointed out the Latin title \"Memorabilia\" was not applied to Xenophon's work until the Middle Ages, and it is more likely ''apomnemoneumata'' was used to describe the oral transmission of the sayings of Jesus in [[early Christianity]].  [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] uses a similar term meaning \"remembered\" (''apomnemoneusen'') when describing how [[St. Mark|Mark]] accurately recorded the \"recollections of [[St. Peter|Peter]]\", and Justin also uses it in reference to Peter in ''Dial.'' 106.3, followed by a quotation found only in the [[Gospel of Mark]] (Mk 3:16\u201317).  Therefore, according to Koester, it is likely that Justin applied the name \"memoirs of the apostles\" analogously to indicate the trustworthy recollections of the apostles found in the written record of the gospels.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 33\u201334,38\u201340\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' pp.&nbsp;33\u201334,38\u201340; pp.&nbsp;33\u201334 \u2013 \"What Papias says about Mark reflects the use of categories which are drawn from the oral tradition.&nbsp;... The written gospels' authority is assured by the same technical terms which had been established for the oral tradition.&nbsp;... The term \"remember\" (mnemoneuein/apomnemoneuein) was decisive for the trustworthiness of the oral tradition.\" pp.&nbsp;39\u201340 \u2013 \"The composite form of the verb \"to remember\" (apomnemoneuein) had been used by Papias of Hierapolis as a technical term for the transmission of oral materials about Jesus. If Justin's term \"memoirs of the apostles\" is derived from this usage, it designates the written gospels as the true recollections of the apostles, trustworthy and accurate, and more reliable than any oral tradition which they are destined to replace.\"</ref>\n\nJustin expounded on the gospel texts as an accurate recording of the [[Bible prophecy|fulfillment of prophecy]], which he combined with quotations of the [[Nevi'im|prophets of Israel]] from the [[LXX]] to demonstrate a proof from prophecy of the [[Kerygma|Christian kerygma]].<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 377\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' p.&nbsp;377 \u2013 \"The Christian proclamation about Jesus as Son of God, however, is true (in contrast to pagan myths), because the Christians possess trustworthy historical documents \u2013 \"remembrances of the apostles\" \u2013 from which it can be shown that everything in Christ's appearance and work happened in complete agreement with prophecy.  What is demonstrated to be true is the Christian kerygma, not the story of the gospels.  The reports contained in the gospels are used to show that the facts about Christ which the kerygma proclaims happened in complete agreement with the prophecy that announced them.\"</ref>  The importance which Justin attaches to the words of the prophets, which he regularly quotes with the formula \"it is written\", shows his estimate of the Old Testament Scriptures.  However, the scriptural authority he attributes to the \"memoirs of the apostles\" is less certain.  Koester articulates a majority view among scholars that Justin considered the \"memoirs of the apostles\" to be accurate historical records but not inspired writings,<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 41\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' p.&nbsp;41 \u2013 \"These gospels for Justin possess the authority of written records.  Although they are read in the service of the church, they are not \"Holy Scripture\" like the law and the prophets.\"</ref> whereas scholar [[Charles E. Hill]], though acknowledging the position of mainstream scholarship, contends that Justin regarded the fulfillment quotations of the gospels to be equal in authority.<ref name=\"Hill 2004\">Hill (2004) pp.&nbsp;345\u201346; p.&nbsp;345 \u2013 \"It is commonly held that in Rome of Justin's day even the Memoirs themselves possessed only a quite limited authority.\"; p.&nbsp;346 \u2013 He sees in Justin \"a parity of authority between these two groups of writings\".</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\n=== Scriptural sources ===\n\n==== Gospels ====\nJustin uses material from the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in the composition of the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue'', either directly, as in the case of Matthew,<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 pp. 130,163\" /> or indirectly through the use of a [[gospel harmony]], which may have been composed by Justin or his school.<ref name=\"Koester 2000 p. 344\" />  However, his use, or even knowledge, of the [[Gospel of John]] is uncertain.  One possible reference to John is a saying that is quoted in the context of a description of Christian baptism (''1 Apol''. 61.4 \u2013 \"Unless you are reborn, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.\").  However, Koester contends that Justin obtained this saying from a baptismal liturgy rather than a written gospel.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 360\u2013361\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' pp.&nbsp;360\u2013361; p.&nbsp;360 \u2013 \"He knew and quoted especially the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; he must have known the Gospel of Mark as well, though there is only one explicit reference to this Gospel (''Dial''. 106.3); he apparently had no knowledge of the Gospel of John.\" footnote #2: \"The only possible reference to the Gospel of John is the quotation of a saying in ''1 Apol''. 61.4..\"</ref> Justin's possible knowledge of John's gospel may be suggested by verbal similarities to John 3:4 directly after the discussion about the new birth (\"Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter their mother's womb is manifest to all\"). Justin also uses language very similar to that of John 1:20 and 1:28. Furthermore, by employing the term \"memoirs of the apostles\" and distinguishing them from the writings of their \"followers\", Justin must have been aware of at least two gospels written by actual apostles. Since one of these must be Matthew, the other can be inferred as John.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==== Apocalypse ====\nJustin does not quote from the [[Book of Revelation]] directly, yet he clearly refers to it, naming [[John of Patmos|John]] as its author (''Dial''. 81.4 \"Moreover also among us a man named John, one of the apostles of Christ, prophesied in a revelation made to him that those who have believed on our Christ will spend a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that hereafter the general and, in short, the eternal resurrection and judgment of all will likewise take place\").  Scholar [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] notes that this reference to the author of the single prophetic book of the New Testament illustrates the distinction Justin made between the role of prophecy and fulfillment quotations from the gospels, as Justin does not mention any of the individual [[canonical gospels]] by name.<ref name=\"Westcott 1875 p. 120\">Westcott (1875) ''A general survey of the canon of the New Testament'', p.&nbsp;120 \u2013 \"To quote prophecy habitually without mentioning the Prophet's name would be to deprive it of half its value; and if it seem strange that Justin does not quote the Evangelists like Prophets, it is no less worthy of notice that he does quote by name the single prophetic book of the New Testament.&nbsp;...

In Justin's works, distinct references are found to [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], and [[2 Thessalonians]], and possible ones to [[Philippians]], [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]], and [[1 Timothy]].

He refers to Justin's primary source for demonstrating scriptural proofs in the ''First Apology'' and parallel passages in the ''Dialogue'' as a \"kerygma source\".  A second source, which was used only in the ''Dialogue'', may be identical to a lost dialogue attributed to [[Aristo of Pella]] on the divine nature of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]], the ''[[Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus]]'' (c. 140).  Justin brings in biblical quotes verbatim from these sources, and he often appears to be paraphrasing his sources very closely, even in his interpretive remarks.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 2007 pp. 380\u2013381\">Skarsaune (2007) ''Jewish Believers in Jesus'' pp.&nbsp;380\u201381</ref>\n\nJustin occasionally uses the Gospel of Matthew directly as a source for Old Testament prophecies to supplement his testimony sources.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 pp. 130,163\">Skarsaune (1987) ''The Proof From Prophecy'' pp.&nbsp;130,163; p.&nbsp;130 \u2013 \"Justin sometimes had direct access to Matthew and quotes OT texts directly from him.&nbsp;...

A comparison of this harmonization of Matthew and Luke in the patristic quotations leaves little doubt that Justin used a harmony of Mt. 7:22f and Lk. 13:26f and that this harmony was known to other fathers in substantially the same form as that used by Justin (Origen ''Contra Celsum'' II 49; Origen ''Ev. Jo.'' XXXII 8,11; Pamphilius ''Apol. pro Orig.'' V).

There is also a small tract in ''1 Apol''. 59\u201360 on borrowings of the philosophers from Moses, particularly Plato.

In this case we have reason to suspect a tractate of some kind, which included Plato quotations as well.\" p.&nbsp;431 \u2013 \"It remains to be remarked that Justin also has made other additions from sources containing OT material, but these are strictly speaking not parts of the scriptural proof.  In ''1 Apol''. 54f and ''Dial''. 69f Justin has added material from a source which was occupied with demonic imitations of OT Messianic prophecies, and in ''1 Apol''. 59f he has a little tract on philosophic borrowings from Moses.

He considered the Old Testament an inspired guide and counselor. He was converted by a Christian philosopher whom he paraphrased as saying:\n:\"There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man. not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things. . . And those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them.\"<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Dialogue with Trypho#Chapter 7|Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 7]]</ref>\n\nThen Justin told his own experience:\n:\"Straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable.\"<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Dialogue with Trypho#Chapter 8|Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 8]]</ref>\n\n===Fulfillment===\nJustin listed the following events as fulfillments of Bible prophecy\n\n* The prophecies concerning the Messiah, and the particulars of His life.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 31|First Apology, Chapter 31]]</ref>\n* The destruction of Jerusalem.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 47|First Apology, chapter 47]]</ref>\n* The Gentiles accepting Christianity.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 49|First Apology, Chapter 49]]</ref>\n* Isaiah predicted that Jesus would be born of a virgin.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 33|First Apology, Chapter 33]]</ref>\n* Micah mentions Bethlehem as the place of His birth.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 34|First Apology, Chapter 34]]</ref>\n* Zechariah forecasts His entry into Jerusalem on the foal of an ass (a donkey).<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 35|First Apology, Chapter 35]]</ref>\n\n===Second Advent and Daniel 7===\nJustin connected the Second Advent with the climax of the prophecy of Daniel 7.\n:\"But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following the dispensation of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow His glorious advent!

He says he tried first the school of a [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, who was unable to explain God's being to him. He then attended a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher but was put off because the philosopher was too eager for his fee. Then he went to hear a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher who demanded that he first learn music, astronomy, and geometry, which he did not wish to do. Subsequently, he adopted [[Platonism]] after encountering a Platonist thinker who had recently settled in his city. \n\n{{Quote|And the perception of immaterial things quite overpowered me, and the contemplation of ideas furnished my mind with wings, so that in a little while I supposed that I had become wise; and such was my stupidity, I expected forthwith to look upon God, for this is the end of Plato's philosophy.<ref name=Dialogue />}}\n\nSome time afterwards, he chanced upon an old man, possibly a Syrian Christian,<ref>Oskar Skarsaune, ''The proof from prophecy: a study in Justin Martyr's proof-text tradition:text-type, provenance, theological profile,'' Brill, 1987 p.246.</ref> in the vicinity of the seashore, who engaged him in a dialogue about God and spoke of the testimony of the prophets as being more reliable than the reasoning of philosophers.\n\n{{Quote|There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man, not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things, and of those matters which the philosopher ought to know, provided he has believed them. For they did not use demonstration in their treatises, seeing that they were witnesses to the truth above all demonstration, and worthy of belief; and those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them, although, indeed, they were entitled to credit on account of the miracles which they performed, since they both glorified the Creator, the God and Father of all things, and proclaimed His Son, the Christ [sent] by Him: which, indeed, the false prophets, who are filled with the lying unclean spirit, neither have done nor do, but venture to work certain wonderful deeds for the purpose of astonishing men, and glorify the spirits and demons of error. But pray that, above all things, the gates of light may be opened to you; for these things cannot be perceived or understood by all, but only by the man to whom God and His Christ have imparted wisdom.<ref name=Dialogue />}}\n\nMoved by the aged man's argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of the Divine. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the [[martyr]]s, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the \"true philosophy.\"  His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus<ref name=\"J.

During the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138\u2013161), he arrived in [[Rome]] and started his own school.  [[Tatian]] was one of his pupils.<ref>Marian Hillar, ''From Logos to Trinity: The Evolution of Religious Beliefs from Pythagoras to Tertullian'', page 139 (Cambridge University Press, 2012). {{ISBN|978-1-107-01330-8}}</ref> In the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], after disputing with the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] philosopher [[Crescens the Cynic|Crescens]], he was denounced by the latter to the authorities, according to Tatian (Address to the Greeks 19) and Eusebius (HE IV 16.7\u20138).  Justin was tried, together with six companions, by [[Junius Rusticus]], who was urban prefect from 163\u2013167, and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]]. Though the precise year of his death is uncertain, it can reasonably be dated by the prefectoral term of Rusticus (who governed from 162 and 168).

And all the martyrs said: Do as you wish; for we are Christians, and we do not sacrifice to idols. The Prefect Rusticus read the sentence: Those who do not wish to sacrifice to the gods and to obey the emperor will be scourged and beheaded according to the laws.

[[Irenaeus]]<ref>''Haer.'' I., xxviii. 1.</ref> speaks of Justin's martyrdom and of Tatian as his disciple.

[[Tertullian]], in his ''[[Adversus Valentinianos]]'', calls Justin a philosopher and a martyr and the earliest antagonist of [[Christian heresy|heretics]]. [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Methodius of Olympus]] also mention or quote him.  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] deals with him at some length,<ref>''Church History'', iv. 18.</ref> and names the following works:\n# The ''[[First Apology]]'' addressed to [[Antoninus Pius]], his sons, and the Roman Senate;<ref>David Rok\u00e9ah, ''Justin Martyr and the Jews'', page 2 (Leiden, Brill, 2002). {{ISBN|90-04-12310-5}}</ref>\n# a ''[[Second Apology of Justin Martyr]]'' addressed to the Roman Senate;\n# the ''Discourse to the Greeks'', a discussion with Greek philosophers on the character of their gods;\n# an ''[[Exhortation to the Greeks|Hortatory Address to the Greeks]]'' (known now not to have been written by Justin<ref>Hardwick, Michael, \"''Contra Apionem'' and ''Antiquatates Judaicae'': Points of Contact\" in [[Louis Feldman|Feldman, Louis H.]] and Levison, John R.

The ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'' assigns his martyrdom to the year 165. A considerable number of other works are given as Justin's by Arethas, Photius, and other writers, but this attribution is now generally admitted to be spurious. The ''Expositio rectae fidei'' has been assigned by Draseke to Apollinaris of Laodicea, but it is probably a work of as late as the 6th century. The ''[[Exhortation to the Greeks|Cohortatio ad Graecos]]'' has been attributed to Apollinaris of Laodicea, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, as well as others. The ''Epistola ad Zenam et Serenum'', an exhortation to Christian living, is dependent upon [[Clement of Alexandria]], and is assigned by [[Pierre Batiffol]] to the Novatian Bishop [[Sisinnius I of Constantinople|Sisinnius]] (c. 400). The extant work under the title \"On the Sovereignty of God\" does not correspond with Eusebius' description of it, though Harnack regards it as still possibly Justin's, and at least of the 2nd century. The author of the smaller treatise ''To the Greeks'' cannot be Justin, because he is dependent on Tatian; Harnack places it between 180 and 240.\n\n===Dialogue with Trypho===\nThe ''Dialogue'' is a later work than the ''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]]''; the date of composition of the latter, judging from the fact that it was addressed to [[Antoninus Pius]] and his adopted sons [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]], must fall between 147 and 161.\n\nIn the ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', after an introductory section, Justin undertakes to show that Christianity is the new law for all men.\n\n===''On The Resurrection''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe treatise ''On the Resurrection'' exists in extensive fragments that are preserved in the ''Sacra parallela''. The fragments begin with the assertion that the truth, and God the author of truth, need no witness, but that as a concession to the weakness of men it is necessary to give arguments to convince those who gainsay it. It is then shown, after a denial of unfounded deductions, that the resurrection of the body is neither impossible nor unworthy of God, and that the evidence of prophecy is not lacking for it. Another fragment takes up the positive proof of the resurrection, adducing that of Christ and of those whom he recalled to life. In yet another fragment the resurrection is shown to be that of what has gone down, i.e., the body; the knowledge concerning it is the new doctrine, in contrast to that of the old philosophers. The doctrine [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the command to keep the body in moral purity.\n\nThe authenticity of the treatise is not so generally accepted as are Justin's other works. Even so, earlier than the ''Sacra parallela'', it is referred to by Procopius of Gaza (c. 465\u2013528).  Methodius appeals to Justin in support of his interpretation of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 15:50 in a way that makes it natural to assume the existence of a treatise on the subject, to say nothing of other traces of a connection in thought both here in Irenaeus (V., ii.-xiii. 5) and in Tertullian, where it is too close to be anything but a conscious following of the Greek. The ''Against Marcion'' is lost, as is the ''Refutation of all Heresies'' to which Justin himself refers in ''Apology'', i. 26; [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], besides perhaps Irenaeus and Tertullian, seems to have used it.\n\n==Role within the Church==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n[[Flacius]] discovered \"blemishes\" in Justin's theology, which he attributed to the influence of pagan philosophers; and in modern times [[Johann Salomo Semler|Semler]] and S.G. Lange have made him out a thorough Hellene, while Semisch and Otto defend him from this charge.\n\nIn opposition to the school of [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]], who considered him a Jewish Christian, [[Albrecht Ritschl]] has pointed out that it was precisely because he was a Gentile Christian that he did not fully understand the [[Old Testament]] foundation of Paul's teaching, and explained in this way the modified character of his Paulinism and his legal mode of thought.\n\nM. von Engelhardt has attempted to extend this line of treatment to Justin's entire theology, and to show that his conceptions of God, of free will and righteousness, of redemption, grace, and merit prove the influence of the cultivated Greek pagan world of the 2nd century, dominated by the Platonic and Stoic philosophy.\n\nBut he admits that Justin is a Christian in his unquestioning adherence to the Church and its faith, his unqualified recognition of the Old Testament, and his faith in Christ as the Son of God the Creator, made manifest in the flesh, crucified, and risen, through which belief he succeeds in getting away from the dualism of both pagan and Gnostic philosophy.\n\nJustin was confident that his teaching was that of the Church at large. He knows of a division among the orthodox only on the question of the [[millennialism|millennium]] and on the attitude toward the milder Jewish Christianity, which he personally is willing to tolerate as long as its professors in their turn do not interfere with the liberty of the Gentile converts; his [[millenarianism]] seems to have no connection with [[Judaism]], but he believes firmly in a millennium, and generally in the Christian [[eschatology]].\n\nAfter collaborating with a Jewish convert to assist him with Hebrew, Justin published an attack on Judaism based upon a no-longer-extant text of a [[Midrash]]. This Midrash was reconstructed and published by [[Saul Lieberman]].\n\nOpposition to Judaism was common among church leaders in his day, however Justin Martyr was hostile towards Jewry and regarded Jews as an accursed people. His anti-Judaic polemics have been cited as an origin of Christian antisemitism,<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Early_Church.html</ref> he was the first to argue that the Romans bore no responsibility for the death of Jesus, supporting the idea of [[Jewish deicide]]. However his views elaborated in the ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' were comparatively tame to those of [[John Chrysostom]] and others.\n\n== Christology ==\nJustin, like others, thought that the Greek philosophers had derived, if not borrowed, the most essential elements of truth found in their teaching from the [[Old Testament]]. But at the same time he adopted the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of the \"seminal word,\" and so philosophy was to him an operation of the Word\u2014in fact, through his identification of the Word with [[Christ]], it was brought into immediate connection with him.<ref name=NSH_284>New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge 3rd ed. 1914. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc06/Page_284.html Pg 284][Exact Quote]</ref>\n\nThus he does not scruple to declare that [[Socrates]] and [[Heraclitus]] were Christians (''Apol.'', i. 46, ii. 10). His aim was to emphasize the absolute significance of Christ, so that all that ever existed of virtue and truth may be referred to him. The old philosophers and law-givers had only a part of the [[Logos]], while the whole appears in Christ.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nWhile the gentile peoples, seduced by devils, had deserted the true God for idols, the Jews and Samaritans possessed the revelation given through the prophets and awaited the [[Messiah]]. However, the law, while containing commandments intended to promote the true fear of God, had other prescriptions of a purely pedagogic nature, which necessarily ceased when Christ, their end, appeared; of such temporary and merely relative regulations were [[circumcision]], animal sacrifices, the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], and the laws as to food. Through Christ, the abiding law of God has been fully proclaimed. In his character, as the teacher of the new doctrine and promulgator of the new law, lies the essential nature of his redeeming work.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nThe idea of an economy of grace, of a restoration of the union with God which had been destroyed by sin, is not foreign to him. It is noteworthy that in the \"Dialogue\" he no longer speaks of a \"seed of the Word\" in every man, and in his non-apologetic works the emphasis is laid upon the redeeming acts of the life of Christ rather than upon the demonstration of the reasonableness and moral value of Christianity, though the fragmentary character of the latter works makes it difficult to determine exactly to what extent this is true and how far the teaching of [[Irenaeus]] on redemption is derived from him.<ref name=NSH_284 />\n\nThe 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' notes that scholars have differed on whether Justin's writings on the nature of God were meant to express his firm opinion on points of doctrine, or to speculate on these matters.  Specific points Justin addressed include that the Logos is \"numerically distinct from the Father\" though \"born of the very substance of the Father,\" and that \"through the Word, God has made everything.\"  Justin used the metaphor of fire to describe the Logos as spreading like a flame, rather than \"dividing\" the substance of the Father.  He also defended the Holy Spirit as a member of the Trinity, as well as the birth of Jesus to Mary when she was a virgin.  The Encyclopedia states that Justin places the genesis of the Logos as a voluntary act of the Father at the beginning of creation, noting that this is an \"unfortunate\" conflict with later Christian teachings.<ref name=OCE_martyr>{{catholic | last = Lebreton |first = Jules | title = St. Justin Martyr|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08580c.htm | volume = 7|inline=yes|accessdate=2 November 2013|prescript=}} <p> The Word is numerically distinct from the Father (Dial., cxxviii, cxxix; cf. lvi, lxii). He was born of the very substance of the Father, not that this substance was divided, but He proceeds from it as one fire does from another at which it is lit (cxxviii, lxi); this form of production (procession) is compared also with that of human speech (lxi). The Word (Logos) is therefore the Son: much more, He alone may properly be called Son (II Apol., vi, 3); He is the monogenes, the unigenitus (Dial., cv). Elsewhere, however, Justin, like St. Paul, calls Him the eldest Son, prototokos (I Apol., xxxiii; xlvi; lxiii; Dial., lxxxiv, lxxxv, cxxv). The Word is God (I Apol., lxiii; Dial., xxxiv, xxxvi, xxxvii, lvi, lxiii, lxxvi, lxxxvi, lxxxvii, cxiii, cxv, cxxv, cxxvi, cxviii). His Divinity, however, seems subordinate, as does the worship which is rendered to Him (I Apol., vi; cf. lxi, 13; Teder, \"Justins des M\u00e4rtyrers Lehre von Jesus Christus\", Freiburg im Br., 1906, 103\u201319). The Father engendered Him by a free and voluntary act (Dial., lxi, c, cxxvii, cxxviii; cf. Teder, op. cit., 104), at the beginning of all His works (Dial., lxi, lxii, II Apol., vi, 3); in this last text certain authors thought they distinguished in the Word two states of being, one intimate, the other outspoken, but this distinction, though found in some other apologists, is in Justin very doubtful. Through the Word God has made everything (II Apol., vi; Dial., cxiv). The Word is diffused through all humanity (I Apol., vi; II, viii; xiii); it was He who appeared to the patriarchs (I Apol., lxii; lxiii; Dial., lvi, lix, lx etc.). Two influences are plainly discernible in the aforesaid body of doctrine. It is, of course, to Christian revelation that Justin owes his concept of the distinct personality of the Word, His Divinity and Incarnation; but philosophic speculation is responsible for his unfortunate concepts of the temporal and voluntary generation of the Word, and for the subordinationism of Justin's theology. It must be recognized, moreover, that the latter ideas stand out more boldly in the \"Apology\" than in the \"Dialogue.\"</ref>\n<!--End Exact Quote-->\n\n== Memoirs of the apostles ==\nJustin Martyr, in his [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|''First Apology'']] (c. 155) and ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' (c. 160),<ref name=\"Rokeah 2002 p. 2\">Rokeah (2002) ''Justin Martyr and the Jews'' p.&nbsp;2 \u2013 His ''First Apology'' dates from about 155 CE, for it mentions (chap. 29) the procurator of Egypt, Felix, who served in this capacity between 151 and 154.

Aune]] has argued that the gospels were modeled after classical [[Greco-Roman]] biographies, and Justin's use of the term ''apomnemoneumata'' to mean all the [[Synoptic Gospels]] should be understood as referring to a written biography such as the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia of Xenophon]]'' because they preserve the authentic teachings of Jesus.<ref name=\"Aune 1987 p. 67\">Aune (1987) ''The New Testament in its Literary Environment'' p.&nbsp;67 \u2013 \"Justin Martyr (writing ca. 155) described the Gospels as 'reminiscences [apomnemoneumata] of the apostles' (1 Apology 66.3; 67.3) and 'reminiscences of Peter' (Dialogue with Trypho 106.3). Thus Justin, like Matthew, Luke, and Papias, prefers to designate the Gospels by a recognized literary form.  Though ''apomnemoneumata'' are not carefully defined in rhetorical handbooks, they are essentially expanded chreiai, i.e., sayings and/or actions of or about specific individuals, set in a narrative framework and transmitted by ''memory'' (hence \"reliable\").&nbsp;... His use of the term \"reminiscences\", therefore, suggests a connection to Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'' (in Greek ''apomnemoneumata''), a \"biography\" of Socrates.\"</ref>  However, scholar [[Helmut Koester]] has pointed out the Latin title \"Memorabilia\" was not applied to Xenophon's work until the Middle Ages, and it is more likely ''apomnemoneumata'' was used to describe the oral transmission of the sayings of Jesus in [[early Christianity]].  [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] uses a similar term meaning \"remembered\" (''apomnemoneusen'') when describing how [[St. Mark|Mark]] accurately recorded the \"recollections of [[St. Peter|Peter]]\", and Justin also uses it in reference to Peter in ''Dial.'' 106.3, followed by a quotation found only in the [[Gospel of Mark]] (Mk 3:16\u201317).  Therefore, according to Koester, it is likely that Justin applied the name \"memoirs of the apostles\" analogously to indicate the trustworthy recollections of the apostles found in the written record of the gospels.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 33\u201334,38\u201340\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' pp.&nbsp;33\u201334,38\u201340; pp.&nbsp;33\u201334 \u2013 \"What Papias says about Mark reflects the use of categories which are drawn from the oral tradition.&nbsp;... The written gospels' authority is assured by the same technical terms which had been established for the oral tradition.&nbsp;... The term \"remember\" (mnemoneuein/apomnemoneuein) was decisive for the trustworthiness of the oral tradition.\" pp.&nbsp;39\u201340 \u2013 \"The composite form of the verb \"to remember\" (apomnemoneuein) had been used by Papias of Hierapolis as a technical term for the transmission of oral materials about Jesus. If Justin's term \"memoirs of the apostles\" is derived from this usage, it designates the written gospels as the true recollections of the apostles, trustworthy and accurate, and more reliable than any oral tradition which they are destined to replace.\"</ref>\n\nJustin expounded on the gospel texts as an accurate recording of the [[Bible prophecy|fulfillment of prophecy]], which he combined with quotations of the [[Nevi'im|prophets of Israel]] from the [[LXX]] to demonstrate a proof from prophecy of the [[Kerygma|Christian kerygma]].<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 377\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' p.&nbsp;377 \u2013 \"The Christian proclamation about Jesus as Son of God, however, is true (in contrast to pagan myths), because the Christians possess trustworthy historical documents \u2013 \"remembrances of the apostles\" \u2013 from which it can be shown that everything in Christ's appearance and work happened in complete agreement with prophecy.  What is demonstrated to be true is the Christian kerygma, not the story of the gospels.  The reports contained in the gospels are used to show that the facts about Christ which the kerygma proclaims happened in complete agreement with the prophecy that announced them.\"</ref>  The importance which Justin attaches to the words of the prophets, which he regularly quotes with the formula \"it is written\", shows his estimate of the Old Testament Scriptures.  However, the scriptural authority he attributes to the \"memoirs of the apostles\" is less certain.  Koester articulates a majority view among scholars that Justin considered the \"memoirs of the apostles\" to be accurate historical records but not inspired writings,<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 41\">Koester 1990 ''Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development'' p.&nbsp;41 \u2013 \"These gospels for Justin possess the authority of written records.  Although they are read in the service of the church, they are not \"Holy Scripture\" like the law and the prophets.\"</ref> whereas scholar [[Charles E. Hill]], though acknowledging the position of mainstream scholarship, contends that Justin regarded the fulfillment quotations of the gospels to be equal in authority.<ref name=\"Hill 2004\">Hill (2004) pp.&nbsp;345\u201346; p.&nbsp;345 \u2013 \"It is commonly held that in Rome of Justin's day even the Memoirs themselves possessed only a quite limited authority.\"; p.&nbsp;346 \u2013 He sees in Justin \"a parity of authority between these two groups of writings\".</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\n=== Scriptural sources ===\n\n==== Gospels ====\nJustin uses material from the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in the composition of the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue'', either directly, as in the case of Matthew,<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 pp. 130,163\" /> or indirectly through the use of a [[gospel harmony]], which may have been composed by Justin or his school.<ref name=\"Koester 2000 p. 344\" />  However, his use, or even knowledge, of the [[Gospel of John]] is uncertain.  One possible reference to John is a saying that is quoted in the context of a description of Christian baptism (''1 Apol''. 61.4 \u2013 \"Unless you are reborn, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.\").  However, Koester contends that Justin obtained this saying from a baptismal liturgy rather than a written gospel.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 360\u2013361\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' pp.&nbsp;360\u2013361; p.&nbsp;360 \u2013 \"He knew and quoted especially the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; he must have known the Gospel of Mark as well, though there is only one explicit reference to this Gospel (''Dial''. 106.3); he apparently had no knowledge of the Gospel of John.\" footnote #2: \"The only possible reference to the Gospel of John is the quotation of a saying in ''1 Apol''. 61.4..\"</ref> Justin's possible knowledge of John's gospel may be suggested by verbal similarities to John 3:4 directly after the discussion about the new birth (\"Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter their mother's womb is manifest to all\"). Justin also uses language very similar to that of John 1:20 and 1:28. Furthermore, by employing the term \"memoirs of the apostles\" and distinguishing them from the writings of their \"followers\", Justin must have been aware of at least two gospels written by actual apostles. Since one of these must be Matthew, the other can be inferred as John.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==== Apocalypse ====\nJustin does not quote from the [[Book of Revelation]] directly, yet he clearly refers to it, naming [[John of Patmos|John]] as its author (''Dial''. 81.4 \"Moreover also among us a man named John, one of the apostles of Christ, prophesied in a revelation made to him that those who have believed on our Christ will spend a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that hereafter the general and, in short, the eternal resurrection and judgment of all will likewise take place\").  Scholar [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] notes that this reference to the author of the single prophetic book of the New Testament illustrates the distinction Justin made between the role of prophecy and fulfillment quotations from the gospels, as Justin does not mention any of the individual [[canonical gospels]] by name.<ref name=\"Westcott 1875 p. 120\">Westcott (1875) ''A general survey of the canon of the New Testament'', p.&nbsp;120 \u2013 \"To quote prophecy habitually without mentioning the Prophet's name would be to deprive it of half its value; and if it seem strange that Justin does not quote the Evangelists like Prophets, it is no less worthy of notice that he does quote by name the single prophetic book of the New Testament.&nbsp;... This reference to the Apocalypse appears to illustrate the difference which Justin makes between his quotations from the Prophecies and the Gospels.\"</ref>\n\n==== Letters ====\nReflecting his opposition to [[Marcion]], Justin's attitude toward the Pauline epistles generally corresponds to that of the later Church.  In Justin's works, distinct references are found to [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], and [[2 Thessalonians]], and possible ones to [[Philippians]], [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]], and [[1 Timothy]]. It seems likely that he also knew [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] and [[1 John]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe apologetic character of Justin's habit of thought appears again in the Acts of his martyrdom, the genuineness of which is attested by internal evidence.<ref name=\"Bonwetsch 1914 p. 284\">Bonwetsch (1914) ''New Schaff\u2013Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', p.&nbsp;284; Also see, [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/JUSTIN MARTYR/Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Justin Martyr|Martyrdom of Justin Martyr]] at Wikisource</ref>\n\n=== Testimony sources ===\nAccording to scholar [[Oskar Skarsaune]], Justin relies on two main sources for his proofs from prophecy that probably circulated as collections of scriptural testimonies within his Christian school.  He refers to Justin's primary source for demonstrating scriptural proofs in the ''First Apology'' and parallel passages in the ''Dialogue'' as a \"kerygma source\".  A second source, which was used only in the ''Dialogue'', may be identical to a lost dialogue attributed to [[Aristo of Pella]] on the divine nature of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]], the ''[[Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus]]'' (c. 140).  Justin brings in biblical quotes verbatim from these sources, and he often appears to be paraphrasing his sources very closely, even in his interpretive remarks.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 2007 pp. 380\u2013381\">Skarsaune (2007) ''Jewish Believers in Jesus'' pp.&nbsp;380\u201381</ref>\n\nJustin occasionally uses the Gospel of Matthew directly as a source for Old Testament prophecies to supplement his testimony sources.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 pp. 130,163\">Skarsaune (1987) ''The Proof From Prophecy'' pp.&nbsp;130,163; p.&nbsp;130 \u2013 \"Justin sometimes had direct access to Matthew and quotes OT texts directly from him.&nbsp;...

No actual narrative material from a gospel is quoted.&nbsp;... However, the quotation of the text of Micah 5:1 is not given in the text of the LXX; rather, Justin follows the form of the text quoted in Matt. 2:6.&nbsp;... The form of the quotation that appears in Matt 2:6 departs considerably from both the LXX and the Hebrew text.  It is, in fact, a combination of Micah 5:1 and 2 Sam 5:2; only the latter speaks of the prince's function as the Shepard of Israel.  The conflated quotation was wholly the work of Matthew.  There can be no question that Justin is quoting this Matthean text.\"</ref>  However, the fulfillment quotations from these sources most often appear to be harmonizations of the gospels of Matthew and Luke.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 365\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' p.&nbsp;365 \u2013 \"The vast majority of the sayings quoted in Justin's writings are harmonizations of the texts of Matthew and Luke.

This assumption, however, cannot explain why also the narrative materials quoted by Justin were drawn from a harmonized gospel text.\"</ref> The question of whether the harmonized gospel materials found in Justin's writings came from a preexisting gospel harmony or were assembled as part of an integral process of creating scriptural [[prooftext]]s is an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 378\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' p.&nbsp;378 \u2013 \"The question is whether Justin composed these harmonizations and inserted additional phrases just for the purpose of his demonstration of scriptural proof or whether he drew on a written gospel text that was already harmonized and expanded.

Rather, his writings permit insights into a school of scriptural exegesis in which careful comparison of written gospels with the prophecies of scripture endeavored to produce an even more comprehensive new gospel text.\"</ref>\n\n==== \"Kerygma source\" ====\nThe following excerpt from ''1 Apol''. 33:1,4\u20135 (partial parallel in ''Dial''. 84) on the [[annunciation]] and [[virgin birth of Jesus]] shows how Justin used harmonized gospel verses from Matthew and Luke to provide a scriptural proof of the messiahship of Jesus based on fulfillment of the prophecy of [[Isaiah 7:14]].<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 p. 145\">Skarsaune (1987) ''The Proof From Prophecy'' p.&nbsp;145 \u2013 \"''1 Apol''. 33 contains an elaborate explanation of Is 7:14.&nbsp;...

Probably all three elements (Prophecy \u2013 Exposition \u2013 Fulfillment report) were present in Justin's source.

In other words: Jesus met the same adversary as the first Adam.\" p.&nbsp;393 \u2013 \"It is interesting to notice that only two Semitic etymologies provided by Justin both refer to the temptation story: 'Satanas' and 'Israel' (''Dial''. 103:5 and ''Dial''. 125:4) \u2013 and as we have seen already, they presuppose a harmonistic version of the temptation story which is not created ''ad hoc'' by Justin.  The gist of the whole material is succinctly summarized in ''Dial''. 103:6: As the devil led Adam astray, he thought he could seduce the second Adam also.\"</ref>}}\n\nThe quotations refer to the fulfillment of a prophecy of [[Psalm 2|Psalm 2:7]] found in the [[Western text-type]] of Luke 3:22.<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 394\u2013395\">Koester (1990) ''Ancients Christians Gospels'' pp.&nbsp;394\u2013395 \u2013 \"In ''Dial''. 88, Justin twice reports the coming of the holy spirit upon Jesus at his baptism.  He gives this report in order to demonstrate the fulfillment of the prophecies of Isa 11:1\u20133 and Joel 2:28\u201329 about the coming of the spirit which he had quoted in ''Dial''. 87:2 and 6.&nbsp;... Finally, the heavenly voice is given by Justin in a citation of Ps. 2:7, while Mark and Matthew present a wording of the heavenly voice which is a conflation of Isa 42:1 and 44:2.  Only the Western text of Luke 3:22 presents the heavenly voice in the form that must be presupposed for Justin's source.  Justin cannot have been the author of this form of the heavenly voice; he had no special interest in proving the fulfillment of this scriptural text, although he is quite aware of its appearance in scripture as a word of David, i.e., a psalm that David wrote.  That Justin's source already contained this form of the heavenly voice is confirmed in ''Dial''. 103:6, where he refers to it once more in passing; introducing a remark about Jesus' temptation, he again quotes the exact text of Luke 3:22 D = Ps. 2:7.\"</ref> Justin's mention of the fire on the Jordan without comment suggests that he was relying on an intermediate source for these gospel quotations,<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 395\">Koester (1990) ''Ancients Christians Gospels'' p.&nbsp;395 \u2013 \"In order to prove the fulfillment of the prophecies of Isa 11:1\u20133 and Joel 2:28\u201329, Justin only had to report the coming of the spirit upon Jesus.  But not only does he add the report about the heavenly voice, he also mentions 'that a fire was lit in the Jordan'.  Nothing in the context of Justin's discussion requires a mention of this phenomenon.  It must have been part of the text Justin was quoting.\"</ref> and his literal interpretation of a pseudo-etymology of the Hebrew word Satan indicates a dependence on a testimony source with a knowledge of Hebrew, which was probably the ''Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus''.<ref name=\"Rokeah 2002 pp. 20\u201321\">Rokeah (2002) ''Justin Martyr and the Jews'' pp.&nbsp;20\u201321 \u2013 \"The accepted view is that Justin did not know Hebrew.  There is clear-cut and overwhelming evidence for Justin's absolute reliance upon the Septuagint.  The explanation for any apparent acquaintance or knowledge of Hebrew in Justin's writings should be sought elsewhere: in his sources.&nbsp;... ''Dial''. 103:5 contains the only two Hebrew\u2013Aramaic etymologies in the entire work: of ''satan'', and of ''yisrael''.  The source of these is apparently the work of Aristo of Pella, ''The Altercation of Jason and Papiscus''.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''Dialogue'' attributed to Aristo of Pella is believed to have furnished Justin with scriptural [[prooftext]]s on the divinity of the Messiah by combining a [[Wisdom]] Christology \u2013 Christ as the incarnation of preexistent Wisdom \u2013 with a [[Second Adam]] Christology \u2013 the first Adam was conquered by Satan, but this [[Fall of Man]] is reversed by Christ as the Second Adam who conquers Satan.  This is implied in the pseudo-etymology in ''Dial''. 103:5\u20136 linking the name of Satan to the \"apostate-serpent\".  The Christology of the source is close to that of the ''[[Ascension of Isaiah]]''.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 2007 pp. 399\u2013400\">Skarsaune (2007) ''Jewish Believers in Jesus'' pp.&nbsp;399\u2013400; \"In Justin's source, the Messiah is presented as God's preexistent Wisdom who has descended to earth, and ascended again to his heavenly glory.&nbsp;... Here I add another aspect of great significance in Justin's source, namely that Jesus is portrayed as the second and anti-typical Adam.  He reverses the fall of Adam by conquering where Adam was conquered.  He \"recapitulates\" in his own story the story of Adam, but with the opposite point of departure, the opposite direction and the opposite result.&nbsp;... The very point of the (pseudo-)etymology given for Satanas in this passage is to identify the Tempter addressed by Jesus in Matt 4:11 (conflated with Matt 16:23) with the serpent that tempted the first man.  In this way the parallelism between the first and second Adam is made plain.  Since Justin knew no Hebrew and probably no Aramaic, there is every reason to think he got this midrashic etymology from a source...\"</ref>\n\n=== Catechetical sources ===\nJustin quotes many sayings of Jesus in ''1 Apol''. 15\u201317 and smaller sayings clusters in ''Dial''. 17:3\u20134; 35:3; 51:2\u20133; and 76:4\u20137.  The sayings are most often harmonizations of Matthew and Luke that appear to be grouped together topically and organized into sayings collections, including material that probably originated from an early Christian [[catechism]].<ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 361\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' p.&nbsp;361 \u2013 \"The most striking feature is that these sayings exhibit many harmonizations of the text of Matthew and Luke.  However, the simple assumption of a harmonized gospel cannot explain all the peculiarities of the quotations.\"</ref><ref name=\"Bellinzoni 1967 pp. 99\u2013100\">Bellinzoni (1967) ''Sayings of Jesus in Justin Martyr'' pp.&nbsp;99\u2013100 \u2013 \"It has already been argued above that the entire section ''Apol''. 15\u201317 may have been based on a single source different from the sources underlying the rest of Justin's sayings of Jesus, and I have tried to indicate that this section has many features in common with primitive Christian catechisms.\"</ref>\n\nThe following example of an ethical teaching [[Expounding of the Law#Oaths|On Swearing Oaths]] in ''1 Apol''. 16:5 shows a combination of sayings material found in Matthew and the [[Epistle of James]]:\n\n<blockquote>Do not swear at all (Mt 5:34).  Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No (Jas 5:12).  Everything beyond these is from evil (Mt 5:37).</blockquote>\n\nThe saying \"Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No\" from James 5:12 is interpolated into a sayings complex from Matthew 5:34,37.  The text appears in a large number of [[Patristic]] quotations and twice in the [[Clementine literature|Clementine Homilies]] (''Hom''. 3:55, 19:2).  Thus, it is likely that Justin was quoting this harmonized text from a catechism.<ref name=\"Bellinzoni 1967 pp. 64\u201367\">Bellinzoni (1967) ''Sayings of Jesus in Justin Martyr'' pp.&nbsp;64\u201367; p.&nbsp;66 \u2013 \"the form of the saying in James is a more simple paranetic form than the text of Matthew, where each example is elaborated and where the command is not what one should do but what one should say. It, therefore, appears that the form of the saying in Jas. 5:12 is older than Matthew's version.&nbsp;... This evidence would seem to indicate that ''Apol''. 16:5 was here based on the text of Mt. 5:34,37 that had either been harmonized in part with Jas. 5:12 or with the parenetic tradition that underlies Jas. 5:12.  The evidence of several of the fathers indicates a widespread knowledge of a text similar to ''Apol''. 16:5.\" (Clem. of Alex. ''Strom''. V 14,99; Clem. of Alex. ''Strom''. VII 11,67; Cyril of Alex. ''De Ador. et Verit. VI; Eusebius ''Dem. Ev.'' III 3,13; Eusebius ''Comm. in Ps. 14'' 4; Epiphanius ''Adv. Her. XIX 6,21; Gregory of Nyssa ''In Cant. of Cant.'' Homily XIII)</ref><ref name=\"Koester 1990 p. 363\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' p.&nbsp;363 \u2013 \"Thus...it is not likely that Justin is quoting from the text of Matthew but from a catechism, whose text was influenced by the formulation preserved in Jas 5:12 but not necessarily dependent upon the Epistle of James.\"</ref>\n\nThe harmonization of Matthew and Luke is evident in the following quotations of Mt 7:22\u201323 and Lk 13:26\u201327, which are used by Justin twice, in ''1 Apol''. 16:11 and ''Dial''. 76:5:\n\n<blockquote>Many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and do powerful deeds?' And then I shall say to them, 'go away from me, workers of lawlessness'.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and prophecy and drive out demons?' And I shall say to them, 'go away from me'.</blockquote>\n\nIn both cases, Justin is using the same harmonized text of Matthew and Luke, although neither of the quotations includes the entire text of those gospel passages.  The last phrase, \"workers of lawlessness\", has an exact parallel with [[2 Clement]] 4:5.  This harmonized text also appears in a large number of quotations by the [[Church Fathers]].<ref name=\"Koester 1990 pp. 356,365\u201367\">Koester (1990) ''Ancient Christian Gospels'' pp.&nbsp;356,365\u201367; p.&nbsp;367 \u2013 \"The method of harmonization includes two different procedures: (1) whenever the texts of Matthew and Luke are closely parallel, either the Matthean or the Lukan phrase or a conflation of both is chosen; (2) whenever the texts of Matthew and Luke differ considerably, as in Matt 7:22 and Luke 13:26, major portions of the two texts are combined; thus, one finds Luke's 'we were eating and drinking' as well as Matthew's 'we prophesied etc.'.\"</ref><ref name=\"Bellinzoni 1967 pp. 22\u201325\">Bellinzoni (1967) ''Sayings of Jesus in Justin Martyr'' pp.&nbsp;22\u201325; pp.&nbsp;24\u201325 \u2013 \"These consistent features of harmonization found in ''Apol''. 16:11 and ''Dial''. 76:5 leave little doubt that Justin used as a source for these passages a written harmony of Mt. 7:22f and Lk. 13:26f, and this harmonization of Matthew and Luke is further evident in several of the early fathers quoted in the texts below.&nbsp;... A comparison of this harmonization of Matthew and Luke in the patristic quotations leaves little doubt that Justin used a harmony of Mt. 7:22f and Lk. 13:26f and that this harmony was known to other fathers in substantially the same form as that used by Justin (Origen ''Contra Celsum'' II 49; Origen ''Ev. Jo.'' XXXII 8,11; Pamphilius ''Apol. pro Orig.'' V). Further, the witness of ''2 Clement'' here proves the existence of this harmonization of Matthew and Luke previous to Justin.\"</ref>  ''1 Apol''. 16:11 is part of a larger unit of sayings material in ''1 Apol'' 16:9\u201313 which combines a warning against being unprepared with a warning against false prophets.

He use an already existing collection.\"</ref>  This unit is part of a larger collection of sayings found in ''1 Apol''. 15\u201317 that appear to have originated from a catechism used by Justin's school in Rome, which may have had a wide circulation.

It is difficult to determine in each instance the degree to which Justin has supplemented and rearranged these collections. But it appears that the catechetical collections already existed and that Justin himself did not compose them.\"</ref>\n\n=== Other sources ===\nJustin includes a tract on Greek mythology in ''1 Apol''. 54 and ''Dial''. 69 which asserts that myths about various pagan deities are imitations of the prophecies about Christ in the Old Testament.  There is also a small tract in ''1 Apol''. 59\u201360 on borrowings of the philosophers from Moses, particularly Plato.  These two tracts may be from the same source, which may have been an early Christian ''Apology''.<ref name=\"Skarsaune 1987 pp. 52\u201353,148\u2013150,431\">Skarsaune (1987) ''The Proof From Prophecy'' pp.&nbsp;52\u201353,148\u2013150,431; p.&nbsp;150 \u2013 \"This tract must have had a somewhat other orientation than the source employed by Justin in ''1 Apol''. 32\u201335.  It was not concerned with a prophecy\u2013fulfillment scheme, but with correspondence between OT texts and Greek mythology.\"  p.&nbsp;53 \u2013 \"It is unlikely that it (the text in ''1 Apol''. 60:9 introduced as a prophecy of Moses) ever occurred in a Bible text...it is more likely that Justin took it from the source which also provided him with the (harmonistic) 'citations' from Plato in A 60.&nbsp;... In this case we have reason to suspect a tractate of some kind, which included Plato quotations as well.\" p.&nbsp;431 \u2013 \"It remains to be remarked that Justin also has made other additions from sources containing OT material, but these are strictly speaking not parts of the scriptural proof.  In ''1 Apol''. 54f and ''Dial''. 69f Justin has added material from a source which was occupied with demonic imitations of OT Messianic prophecies, and in ''1 Apol''. 59f he has a little tract on philosophic borrowings from Moses.  One should not exclude the possibility that these two blocks of material derive from the same source, which might well be an earlier Christian ''Apology''.\"</ref>\n\n==Prophetic exegesis==\nJustin's writings constitute a storehouse of early interpretation of the prophetic Scriptures.\n\n===Belief in prophecy===\nThe truth of the prophets, he declares, compels assent. He considered the Old Testament an inspired guide and counselor. He was converted by a Christian philosopher whom he paraphrased as saying:\n:\"There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man. not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things. . . And those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them.\"<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Dialogue with Trypho#Chapter 7|Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 7]]</ref>\n\nThen Justin told his own experience:\n:\"Straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable.\"<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Dialogue with Trypho#Chapter 8|Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 8]]</ref>\n\n===Fulfillment===\nJustin listed the following events as fulfillments of Bible prophecy\n\n* The prophecies concerning the Messiah, and the particulars of His life.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 31|First Apology, Chapter 31]]</ref>\n* The destruction of Jerusalem.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 47|First Apology, chapter 47]]</ref>\n* The Gentiles accepting Christianity.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 49|First Apology, Chapter 49]]</ref>\n* Isaiah predicted that Jesus would be born of a virgin.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 33|First Apology, Chapter 33]]</ref>\n* Micah mentions Bethlehem as the place of His birth.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 34|First Apology, Chapter 34]]</ref>\n* Zechariah forecasts His entry into Jerusalem on the foal of an ass (a donkey).<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 35|First Apology, Chapter 35]]</ref>\n\n===Second Advent and Daniel 7===\nJustin connected the Second Advent with the climax of the prophecy of Daniel 7.\n:\"But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following the dispensation of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow His glorious advent!

[[Hajduk Split]] won the league title.\n\nA total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|defending champions]] [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] nearly relegated, finishing the season in the 15th place one point clear of the relegation zone. [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] both finished the season on 50 points, but Hajduk won the championship having the better goal difference. However, there was a controversy in the first round when [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] defeated Dinamo 2\u20131 at [[Stadion Kantrida|Kantrida]]. Dinamo claimed that [[Edmond Tomi\u0107]], who joined Rijeka that season from [[KF Liria|Lirija]], didn't serve a one-match suspension following two yellow cards received while playing for his former club. They appealed and after two months it has been decided to award the match 3\u20130 to Dinamo. After several appeals from both sides, in spring 1979 [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] ruled in favour of Rijeka. The case was brought to Employment Appeal Tribunal, which four years later ruled Dinamo as champions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ezadar.hr/clanak/neodigrana-utakmica-rijeka-dinamo-novi-slucaja-tomic |title=Neodigrana utakmica Rijeka \u2013 Dinamo, novi Slu\u010daja Tomi\u0107? |last=ts/eZd |first= |date=2 November 2008 |work=ezadar.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe season began on 12 August 1978 and concluded on 17 June 1979. This was the third and last national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to four consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976 (not contested in 1975). Striker [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] was the top goalscorer with 24 goals. This was the second achievement for Savi\u0107, who previously topped the scoring table in the [[1974\u201375 Yugoslav First League|1974\u201375 season]]. [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] entered the [[1979\u201380 European Cup Winners' Cup]], after defeating [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the final of [[Yugoslav Cup]] with an aggregate score 2\u20131.\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|1977\u201378 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1977\u201378 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] and [[FK Trep\u010da|Trep\u010da Kosovska Mitrovica]] were relegated from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. The two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Napredak Kru\u0161evac|Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] and [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo]].\n\n{{Location map+ |Yugoslavia

League|1979\u201380]]\n}}\n\nThe '''1978\u201379 [[Yugoslav First League]] season''' was the 33rd season of the First Federal League ({{lang-sh|Prva savezna liga}}), the top level [[association football]] competition of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], since its establishment in 1946. [[Hajduk Split]] won the league title.\n\nA total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|defending champions]] [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] nearly relegated, finishing the season in the 15th place one point clear of the relegation zone. [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] both finished the season on 50 points, but Hajduk won the championship having the better goal difference. However, there was a controversy in the first round when [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] defeated Dinamo 2\u20131 at [[Stadion Kantrida|Kantrida]]. Dinamo claimed that [[Edmond Tomi\u0107]], who joined Rijeka that season from [[KF Liria|Lirija]], didn't serve a one-match suspension following two yellow cards received while playing for his former club. They appealed and after two months it has been decided to award the match 3\u20130 to Dinamo. After several appeals from both sides, in spring 1979 [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] ruled in favour of Rijeka. The case was brought to Employment Appeal Tribunal, which four years later ruled Dinamo as champions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ezadar.hr/clanak/neodigrana-utakmica-rijeka-dinamo-novi-slucaja-tomic |title=Neodigrana utakmica Rijeka \u2013 Dinamo, novi Slu\u010daja Tomi\u0107? |last=ts/eZd |first= |date=2 November 2008 |work=ezadar.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe season began on 12 August 1978 and concluded on 17 June 1979. This was the third and last national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to four consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976 (not contested in 1975). Striker [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] was the top goalscorer with 24 goals. This was the second achievement for Savi\u0107, who previously topped the scoring table in the [[1974\u201375 Yugoslav First League|1974\u201375 season]]. [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] entered the [[1979\u201380 European Cup Winners' Cup]], after defeating [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the final of [[Yugoslav Cup]] with an aggregate score 2\u20131.\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|1977\u201378 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1977\u201378 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] and [[FK Trep\u010da|Trep\u010da Kosovska Mitrovica]] were relegated from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. The two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Napredak Kru\u0161evac|Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] and [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo]].\n\n{{Location map+ |Yugoslavia

These enclosures used 128 [[Megabyte]]s (MB) of [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) for data storage and several high-speed [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) inputs and outputs for data transfer.  These systems were mainly used to acquire and analyze signals in real time.<ref name=tms_history_of_dod>{{cite web|title=TMS History of Working With the US DoD| last=Frost| first=Holly| url=https://www.storagesearch.com/tms-history-dod.pdf|publisher=Texas Memory Systems |accessdate=2020-03-31 |date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[1980s oil glut]] caused disruption in the oil and gas industry, TMS shifted focus away from SSDs and onto [[Digital signal processing]] products.<ref name=\"company_history\"></ref>  The previously-designed SAM storage systems were enhanced by adding in a custom designed DSP board.  Prior to this added DSP capability, to analyze a signal, a user would have to send the signal to the SAM storage for staging, engage a separate system to perform digital signal processing, then store the result back to the SAM system for analyzing.  Adding the DSP processor into the storage system itself meant that the data could be stored, processed, and analyzed all within the SAM system itself, relieving the host systems from processing duties.  With this change in product focus, the SAM product line became known for DSP more than for SSD.  The company would release 3 more DSP systems under the SAM brand name in the 1990s: The SAM-2000 (1990), the SAM-350, and the SAM-450 (1997).<ref name=\"tms_history_of_dod\"></ref><ref name=\"time_matters\"></ref>\n\n=== XP product line ===\nWhile the company was developing SAM systems that attached to multiple hosts, it also started developing DSP solutions on PCI cards to address the single-host market.

These enclosures used 128 [[Megabyte]]s (MB) of [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) for data storage and several high-speed [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) inputs and outputs for data transfer.  These systems were mainly used to acquire and analyze signals in real time.<ref name=tms_history_of_dod>{{cite web|title=TMS History of Working With the US DoD| last=Frost| first=Holly| url=https://www.storagesearch.com/tms-history-dod.pdf|publisher=Texas Memory Systems |accessdate=2020-03-31 |date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[1980s oil glut]] caused disruption in the oil and gas industry, TMS shifted focus away from SSDs and onto [[Digital signal processing]] products.<ref name=\"company_history\"></ref>  The previously-designed SAM storage systems were enhanced by adding in a custom designed DSP board.  Prior to this added DSP capability, to analyze a signal, a user would have to send the signal to the SAM storage for staging, engage a separate system to perform digital signal processing, then store the result back to the SAM system for analyzing.  Adding the DSP processor into the storage system itself meant that the data could be stored, processed, and analyzed all within the SAM system itself, relieving the host systems from processing duties.  With this change in product focus, the SAM product line became known for DSP more than for SSD.  The company would release 3 more DSP systems under the SAM brand name in the 1990s: The SAM-2000 (1990), the SAM-350, and the SAM-450 (1997).<ref name=\"tms_history_of_dod\"></ref><ref name=\"time_matters\"></ref>\n\n=== XP product line ===\nWhile the company was developing SAM systems that attached to multiple hosts, it also started developing DSP solutions on PCI cards to address the single-host market.

They still inhabit the forests of the south and east provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=About.com|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/cameroon/p/CameroonHist.htm}}</ref>  [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speakers originating in the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests|Cameroonian highlands]] were among the first groups to move out before other invaders.\n\nThe [[Mandara kingdom]] in the [[Mandara Mountains]] was founded around 1500 and erected [[Fortification|fortified structures]], the purpose and exact history of which are still unresolved. The [[Aro Confederacy]] of [[Nigeria]] had a presence in [[British Cameroon|Western (later called British) Cameroon]] due to trade and migration in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nDuring the late 1770s and the early 19th century, the [[Fula people|Fula]]ni, an [[Islam]]ic [[pastoralism|pastoral people]] of the western [[Sahel]], conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on Cameroon's doorstep in the 16th century, [[malaria]] prevented significant European settlement and conquest of the interior until the late 1870s, when large supplies of the malaria suppressant [[quinine]] became available. The early European presence in Cameroon was primarily devoted to coastal trade and the [[Slavery in Africa|acquisition of slaves]]. The northern part of the country was an important part of the Muslim slave trade network. The trade was largely suppressed by the mid-19th century. [[Christian missionaries]] established a presence in the late 19th century and continue to play a role in Cameroonian life.\n\n==Colonization==\n[[Image:German building at Ambam.jpg|thumb|left|German-built building at [[Ambam]], today used as a school]]\n[[Image:Cameroon boundary changes.PNG|thumb|right|'''Cameroon over time'''\n{{legend|darkorange|German [[Kamerun]]}}\n{{legend|red|British [[Cameroons]]}}\n{{legend|blue|French [[Cameroun]]}}\n{{legend|green|Republic of [[Cameroon]]}}\n]]\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 163-051, Kamerun, Weihnachten am Mungo.jpg|thumb|German Settlers celebrating [[Christmas]] in Kamerun]]\n:''Further information: [[German Kamerun]], [[French Cameroun]], [[British Cameroons]]''\n\nBeginning on July 5, 1884, all of present-day Cameroon and parts of several of its neighbours became [[German colonial empire|a German colony]], [[Kamerun]], with a capital first at [[Buea]] and later at [[Yaound\u00e9]].\n\nGermany was particularly interested in Cameroon's [[Agriculture|agricultural]] potential and entrusted large firms with the task of exploiting and exporting it. [[Otto von Bismarck|Chancellor Bismarck]] defined the order of priorities as follows: \"first the merchant, then the soldier\". It was under the influence of a businessman [[Adolph Woermann]], whose company set up a trading house in [[Douala]], that Bismarck, initially skeptical about the interest of the colonial project, was convinced. Large German trading companies ([[Woermann-Linie|Woermann]], [[Jantzen & Thorm\u00e4hlen]]) and concession companies ([[:de: S\u00fcdkamerun Gesellschaft|S\u00fcdkamerun Gesellschaft]], [[:de: Nord-West Kamerun Gesellschaft|Nord-West Kamerun Gesellschaft]]) established themselves massively in the colony. Letting the big companies impose their order, the administration simply supported them, protected them and tried to eliminate indigenous rebellions.<ref name=modo />\n\nThe imperial German government made substantial investments in the [[infrastructure]] of Cameroon, including the extensive [[railway]]s, such as the 160-metre [[Japoma Bridge|single-span railway bridge]] on the southern branch of [[Sanaga River]]. However, the indigenous peoples proved reluctant to work on these projects, so the Germans instigated a harsh and unpopular system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 125.</ref> In fact, [[Jesko von Puttkamer]] was relieved of duty as governor of the colony due to his untoward actions toward the native Cameroonians.<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 226.</ref> In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]] after the [[Agadir Crisis]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 portion of the territory of [[French Equatorial Africa]] to Kamerun which became [[Neukamerun]], while Germany ceded a smaller area in the north in present-day [[Chad]] to France.\n\nIn [[World War I]], the British invaded Cameroon from [[Nigeria]] in 1914 in the [[Kamerun campaign]], with the last German fort in the country [[Siege of Mora|surrendering]] in February 1916.  After the war, this colony was partitioned between the United Kingdom and France under June 28, 1919 [[League of Nations mandate#Class B mandates|League of Nations mandates (Class B)]]. France gained the larger geographical share, transferred Neukamerun back to neighboring French colonies, and ruled the rest from Yaound\u00e9 as [[French Cameroun|Cameroun]] (French Cameroons). Britain's territory, a strip bordering [[Nigeria]] from the sea to [[Lake Chad]], with an equal population was ruled from [[Lagos]] as [[Cameroons]] (British Cameroons). German administrators were allowed to once again run the plantations of the southwestern coastal area. A British parliamentary publication, ''Report on the British Sphere of the Cameroons'' (May 1922, p.&nbsp;62-8), reported that the German plantations there were \"as a whole . . . wonderful examples of industry, based on solid scientific knowledge. The natives have been taught discipline and have come to realize what can be achieved by industry. Large numbers who return to their villages take up cocoa or other cultivation on their own account, thus increasing the general prosperity of the country.\"\n\n==La Republic Du Cameroun==\nThe French administration, reluctant to return their pre-war possessions to German companies, reassigned some of them to French companies. This was particularly the case for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re des caoutchoucs, which obtained plantations put into operation during the German period and became the largest company in Cameroon under French mandate. Roads were being built to link the main cities together, as well as various infrastructure such as bridges and airports. The Douala-Yaound\u00e9 railway line, begun under the German regime, had been completed. Thousands of workers were forcibly deported to this site to work fifty-four hours a week. Workers also suffered from lack of food and the massive presence of mosquitoes. In 1925, the mortality rate on the site was 61.7%. However, the other sites were not as deadly, although working conditions were generally very harsh.<ref name=modo />\n\nFrench Cameroon joined the [[Free France]] in August 1940. The system established by Free France was similar to a military dictatorship. [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]] established a state of siege throughout the country and abolished almost all public freedom. The objective was to neutralize any potential feelings of independence or sympathy for the former German colonizer. Indigenous people known for their Germanophilia were executed in public places. In 1945, the country was placed under the supervision of the United Nations. Despite this, in 1946 it became an \"associated territory\" of the [[French Union]].\n\n==Towards independence of La Republic Du Cameroun (1955\u20131960)==\nIn 1948, the [[Union des populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), a nationalist movement, was founded and Ruben Um Nyobe took over as its leader. In May 1955, the arrests of independence activists were followed by riots in several cities across the country. The repression caused several dozen (the French administration officially lists twenty-two, although secret reports acknowledge many more) or hundreds of deaths. The UPC was banned and nearly 800 of its activists were arrested, many of whom would be beaten in prison. Wanted by the police, UPC activists take refuge in the forests, where they formed maquis, or in neighbouring British Cameroon. The French authorities repressed these events, and made arbitrary arrests. The party received the support of personalities such as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Kwame Nkrumah and France's action was denounced at the UN by representatives of countries such as India, Syria and the Soviet Union.<ref name=modo>Thomas Deltombe, Manuel Domergue, Jacob Tatsita, Kamerun !, La D\u00e9couverte, 2019</ref>\n\nAn insurrection broke out among the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa people]] on the night of 18 to 19 December 1956: several dozen anti-UPC figures were murdered or kidnapped, bridges, telephone lines and other infrastructure were sabotaged. Units of the Cameroonian guard violently repressed these events, which led to the rallying of the peasants to the maquis. Several UPC maquis were formed with their \"generals\" and \"captains\" leading \"regiments\" (150\u2013200 guerrillas) and \"battalions\" (50 guerrillas). The weapons were very basic: a few stolen guns and pistols, but mainly machetes, clubs, bows and arrows. To isolate the rebellion from the Bassa civilian population, who were suspected of being particularly independentist, they were deported to camps along the main roads.

The [[German Empire]] named the territory [[Kamerun]].\n\n===League of Nations Mandate===\nDuring the [[First World War]], it was occupied by British, [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops, and a later [[League of Nations Mandate]] to Great Britain and France by the [[League of Nations]] in 1922. The French mandate was known as [[Cameroun]] and the British territory was administered as two areas, '''[[Northern Cameroons]]''' and '''[[Southern Cameroons]]'''. Northern Cameroons consisted of two non-contiguous sections, divided by a point where the Nigerian and Cameroun borders met.  In the 1930s, most of the white population consisted of [[Germans]], which were interned in British camps starting in June 1940. The native population of 400,000 showed little interest in volunteering for the British forces; only 3,500 men did so.<ref>I.C.B Dear, ed, ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) p 163</ref>\n\n===Trust territory===\nWhen the [[League of Nations]] ceased to exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were reclassified as [[UN trust territory|UN trust territories]], henceforth administered through the [[UN Trusteeship Council]]. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence. The United Nations approved the Trusteeship Agreements for British Cameroons to be governed by Britain on 6 December 1946.\n\n===Independence===\nFrench Cameroun became independent, as Cameroun or Cameroon, in January 1960, and Nigeria was scheduled for independence later that same year, which raised question of what to do with the British territory. After some discussion (which had been going on since 1959), a [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|plebiscite]] was agreed to and held on 11 February 1961. The Muslim-majority Northern area opted for union with Nigeria, and the Southern area voted to join Cameroon.<ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p177 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>\n\nNorthern Cameroons became the [[Sardauna, Nigeria|Sardauna Province]] of [[Northern Nigeria]]<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HCoSuJMof9EC&lpg=PA155&dq=%22northern%20cameroons%22%20%22sardauna%20province%22&pg=PA155#v=onepage&q=%22northern%20cameroons%22%20%22sardauna%20province%22&f=false ''Parties and Politics in Northern Nigeria''], Routledge, 1968, page 155</ref> on 31 May 1961, while Southern Cameroons became West Cameroon, a constituent state of the [[Federal Republic of Cameroon]], later that year on 1 October 1961.\n\n==Cameroon after independence==\n[[File:Flag of Cameroon (1961-1975).svg|thumbnail|1961\u20131975]]\n[[File:Monument Reunification.jpg|thumb|[[Reunification Monument (Cameroon)|Reunification Monument]] in [[Yaound\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrench Cameroon achieved independence on January 1, 1960 as '''La Republique du Cameroun'''. After [[Guinea]], it was the second of France's colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa to become independent. On 21 February 1960, the new nation held a constitutional referendum. On 5 May 1960, [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] became president. On 11 February 1961, a [[plebiscite]] organised by the United Nations was held in the British controlled part of Cameroon (British Northern and British Southern Cameroons). The pleibiscite was to choose between free association with an independent Nigerian state or re-unification with the independent Republic of Cameroun. On 12 February 1961,the results of the plebiscite were released and British Northern Cameroons attached itself to Nigeria, while the southern part voted for reunification with the Republic Of Cameroon. To negotiate the terms of this union, the [[Foumban Conference]] was held on 16\u201321 July 1961. [[John Ngu Foncha]], the leader of the [[Kamerun National Democratic Party]] . The British Southern Cameroons was to be referred to as West Cameroon and the French part as East Cameroon. Buea became the capital of the now West Cameroon while Yaounde doubled as the federal capital and East Cameroon. Ahidjo accepted the federation, thinking it was a step towards a unitary state. On 14 August 1961, the federal constitution was adopted, with Ahidjo as president. Foncha became the prime minister of west Cameroon and vice president of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. On 1 September 1966 the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU) was created by the union of political parties of East and West Cameroon. Most decisions about West Cameroon were taken without consultation, which led to widespread feelings  amongst the West Cameroonian public that although they voted for reunification, what they were getting is absorption or domination\".<ref>The Untold Story of Reunification: (1955\u20131961)</ref>\n\nDuring the first years of the regime, the French ambassador Jean-Pierre B\u00e9nard is sometimes considered as the true \"president\" of Cameroon. This independence is indeed largely theoretical since French \"advisers\" are responsible for assisting each minister and have the reality of power. The [[Gaullist]] government preserves its influence over the country through the signing of \"cooperation agreements\" covering all sectors of Cameroon's sovereignty. Thus, in the monetary field, Cameroon retains the [[CFA franc]] and entrusts its monetary policy to its former guardian power. All strategic resources are exploited by France, French troops are maintained in the country, and a large proportion of Cameroonian army officers are French, including the Chief of Staff.<ref name=modo />\n\nOn October 1, 1961, the largely Muslim northern two-thirds of [[British Cameroons]] voted to join Nigeria; the largely Christian southern third, [[Southern Cameroons]], voted, in a referendum, to join with the Republic of Cameroon to form the '''Federal Republic of Cameroon'''. The formerly French and British regions each maintained substantial [[Self-governance|autonomy]]. Ahidjo was chosen president of the federation in 1961. In 1962, the Francs CFA became the official currency in Cameroon.\n\nThe authorities are multiplying the legal provisions enabling them to free themselves from the rule of law: arbitrary extension of police custody, prohibition of meetings and rallies, submission of publications to prior censorship, restriction of freedom of movement through the establishment of passes or curfews, prohibition for trade unions to issue subscriptions, etc. Anyone accused of \"compromising public safety\" is deprived of a lawyer and cannot appeal the judgment. Sentences of life imprisonment at hard labour or death penalty \u2013 executions can be public \u2013 are thus numerous. A one-party system was introduced in 1966.<ref name=modo />\n\nAhidjo successfully suppressed the continuing UPC rebellion, capturing the last important rebel leader in 1970. On 28 March 1970 Ahidjo renewed his mandate as the supreme magistracy; [[Solomon Tandeng Muna]]  became Vice President. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state called the '''United Republic of Cameroon'''. \nAlthough Ahidjo's rule was characterised as authoritarian, he was seen as noticeably lacking in charisma in comparison to many post-colonial African leaders. He didn't follow the anti-western policies pursued by many of these leaders, which helped Cameroon achieve a degree of comparative political stability and economic growth.\n\nCameroon became an oil-producing country in 1977. Claiming to want to make reserves for difficult times, the authorities manage \"off-budget\" oil revenues in total opacity (the funds are placed in [[Paris]], [[Switzerland]] and [[New York City|New York]] accounts). Several billion dollars are thus diverted to the benefit of oil companies and regime officials. The influence of France and its 9,000 nationals in Cameroon remains considerable. African Affairs magazine noted in the early 1980s that they \"continue to dominate almost all key sectors of the economy, much as they did before independence. French nationals control 55% of the modern sector of the Cameroonian economy and their control over the banking system is total<ref name=modo />\n\nOn 30 June 1975 [[Paul Biya]] was appointed vice president. Ahidjo resigned as president in 1982 and was constitutionally succeeded by his [[Prime Minister]], [[Paul Biya]], a career official. Ahidjo later regretted his choice of successors, but his supporters failed to overthrow Biya in a [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|1984 coup]]. Biya won single-candidate elections in 1983 and 1984 when the country was again named the '''Republic of Cameroon'''.  Biya has remained in power, winning flawed multiparty elections in 1992, 1997, 2004 and 2011. His [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) party holds a sizeable majority in the legislature.\n\nBy April 6, 1984, the country witnessed its first coup d'\u00e9tat headed by col. Issa Adoum.\nAt about 3 am rebel forces mostly of the Republican guard under the orders of colonel Ibrahim Saleh, attempted to '''unseat Biya's government.''' The rebels took charge of the Yaounde airport, national radio station and announced the takeover of government. They attacked the presidency. The civilian northerner who was manager of FONADER '''Issa Adoum''' was expected to become the new interim president. Unfortunately, many reasons led to its failure.\nThe principal coup plotters had been arrested by April 10, 1984 and President Biya addressed the nation that calm had been restored.\n\nOn August 15, 1984, [[Lake Monoun]] exploded in a [[limnic eruption]] that released [[carbon dioxide]], [[Asphyxia|suffocating]] 37 people to death. On August 21, 1986, another limnic eruption at [[Lake Nyos]] killed as many as 1,800 people and 3,500 livestock.  The two disasters are the only recorded instances of limnic eruptions.\n\nIn May 2014, in the wake of the [[Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]], Presidents [[Paul Biya]] of Cameroon and [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] of [[Chad]] announced they were waging war on [[Boko Haram]], and deployed troops to the Nigerian border.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Cameroon, Chad Deploy Troops to Fight Boko Haram \u2013 Nigeria\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/cameroon-chad-deploy-troops-fight-boko-haram\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| last = Kaze\n| first = Rennier\n| title = Dans le Nord du Cameroun, la \"guerre\" contre Boko Haram a commenc\u00e9 \u2013 Cameroon\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| date = 2014-06-06\n| language = French\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/dans-le-nord-du-cameroun-la-guerre-contre-boko-haram-commenc\n}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006 a final resolution to the dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich [[Bakassi peninsula]] was expected. In October 2002, the International Court of Justice had ruled in favour of Cameroon. Nonetheless, a lasting solution would require agreement by both countries\u2019 presidents, parliaments, and by the [[United Nations]]. The peninsula was the site of fighting between the two countries in 1994 and again in June 2005, which led to the death of a Cameroonian soldier. In 2006, Nigerian troops left the peninsula.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Boko Haram insurgency]] spread into Cameroon from Nigeria. Cameroon announced in September 2018 that Boko Haram had been repelled, but the conflict persists in the northern border areas nonetheless.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cameroon-boko-haram-1.4844513 Boko Haram has been repelled, Cameroon's leader declares], CBC, Sep 30, 2018.

In September 2017, the protests and the government's response to them escalated into an [[Anglophone Crisis|armed conflict]], with separatists declaring the independence of [[Ambazonia]] and starting a guerilla war against the Cameroonian Army.\n\n==Football==\nCameroon has received some international attention following the relative success of its [[Cameroon national football team|football team]]. It has qualified for the FIFA World Cup on a number of occasions.

The [[Aro Confederacy]] of [[Nigeria]] had a presence in [[British Cameroon|Western (later called British) Cameroon]] due to trade and migration in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nDuring the late 1770s and the early 19th century, the [[Fula people|Fula]]ni, an [[Islam]]ic [[pastoralism|pastoral people]] of the western [[Sahel]], conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on Cameroon's doorstep in the 16th century, [[malaria]] prevented significant European settlement and conquest of the interior until the late 1870s, when large supplies of the malaria suppressant [[quinine]] became available. The early European presence in Cameroon was primarily devoted to coastal trade and the [[Slavery in Africa|acquisition of slaves]]. The northern part of the country was an important part of the Muslim slave trade network. The trade was largely suppressed by the mid-19th century. [[Christian missionaries]] established a presence in the late 19th century and continue to play a role in Cameroonian life.\n\n==Colonization==\n[[Image:German building at Ambam.jpg|thumb|left|German-built building at [[Ambam]], today used as a school]]\n[[Image:Cameroon boundary changes.PNG|thumb|right|'''Cameroon over time'''\n{{legend|darkorange|German [[Kamerun]]}}\n{{legend|red|British [[Cameroons]]}}\n{{legend|blue|French [[Cameroun]]}}\n{{legend|green|Republic of [[Cameroon]]}}\n]]\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 163-051, Kamerun, Weihnachten am Mungo.jpg|thumb|German Settlers celebrating [[Christmas]] in Kamerun]]\n:''Further information: [[German Kamerun]], [[French Cameroun]], [[British Cameroons]]''\n\nBeginning on July 5, 1884, all of present-day Cameroon and parts of several of its neighbours became [[German colonial empire|a German colony]], [[Kamerun]], with a capital first at [[Buea]] and later at [[Yaound\u00e9]].\n\nGermany was particularly interested in Cameroon's [[Agriculture|agricultural]] potential and entrusted large firms with the task of exploiting and exporting it. [[Otto von Bismarck|Chancellor Bismarck]] defined the order of priorities as follows: \"first the merchant, then the soldier\". It was under the influence of a businessman [[Adolph Woermann]], whose company set up a trading house in [[Douala]], that Bismarck, initially skeptical about the interest of the colonial project, was convinced. Large German trading companies ([[Woermann-Linie|Woermann]], [[Jantzen & Thorm\u00e4hlen]]) and concession companies ([[:de: S\u00fcdkamerun Gesellschaft|S\u00fcdkamerun Gesellschaft]], [[:de: Nord-West Kamerun Gesellschaft|Nord-West Kamerun Gesellschaft]]) established themselves massively in the colony. Letting the big companies impose their order, the administration simply supported them, protected them and tried to eliminate indigenous rebellions.<ref name=modo />\n\nThe imperial German government made substantial investments in the [[infrastructure]] of Cameroon, including the extensive [[railway]]s, such as the 160-metre [[Japoma Bridge|single-span railway bridge]] on the southern branch of [[Sanaga River]]. However, the indigenous peoples proved reluctant to work on these projects, so the Germans instigated a harsh and unpopular system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 125.</ref> In fact, [[Jesko von Puttkamer]] was relieved of duty as governor of the colony due to his untoward actions toward the native Cameroonians.<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 226.</ref> In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]] after the [[Agadir Crisis]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 portion of the territory of [[French Equatorial Africa]] to Kamerun which became [[Neukamerun]], while Germany ceded a smaller area in the north in present-day [[Chad]] to France.\n\nIn [[World War I]], the British invaded Cameroon from [[Nigeria]] in 1914 in the [[Kamerun campaign]], with the last German fort in the country [[Siege of Mora|surrendering]] in February 1916.  After the war, this colony was partitioned between the United Kingdom and France under June 28, 1919 [[League of Nations mandate#Class B mandates|League of Nations mandates (Class B)]]. France gained the larger geographical share, transferred Neukamerun back to neighboring French colonies, and ruled the rest from Yaound\u00e9 as [[French Cameroun|Cameroun]] (French Cameroons). Britain's territory, a strip bordering [[Nigeria]] from the sea to [[Lake Chad]], with an equal population was ruled from [[Lagos]] as [[Cameroons]] (British Cameroons). German administrators were allowed to once again run the plantations of the southwestern coastal area. A British parliamentary publication, ''Report on the British Sphere of the Cameroons'' (May 1922, p.&nbsp;62-8), reported that the German plantations there were \"as a whole . . . wonderful examples of industry, based on solid scientific knowledge. The natives have been taught discipline and have come to realize what can be achieved by industry. Large numbers who return to their villages take up cocoa or other cultivation on their own account, thus increasing the general prosperity of the country.\"\n\n==La Republic Du Cameroun==\nThe French administration, reluctant to return their pre-war possessions to German companies, reassigned some of them to French companies. This was particularly the case for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re des caoutchoucs, which obtained plantations put into operation during the German period and became the largest company in Cameroon under French mandate. Roads were being built to link the main cities together, as well as various infrastructure such as bridges and airports. The Douala-Yaound\u00e9 railway line, begun under the German regime, had been completed. Thousands of workers were forcibly deported to this site to work fifty-four hours a week. Workers also suffered from lack of food and the massive presence of mosquitoes. In 1925, the mortality rate on the site was 61.7%. However, the other sites were not as deadly, although working conditions were generally very harsh.<ref name=modo />\n\nFrench Cameroon joined the [[Free France]] in August 1940. The system established by Free France was similar to a military dictatorship. [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]] established a state of siege throughout the country and abolished almost all public freedom. The objective was to neutralize any potential feelings of independence or sympathy for the former German colonizer. Indigenous people known for their Germanophilia were executed in public places. In 1945, the country was placed under the supervision of the United Nations. Despite this, in 1946 it became an \"associated territory\" of the [[French Union]].\n\n==Towards independence of La Republic Du Cameroun (1955\u20131960)==\nIn 1948, the [[Union des populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), a nationalist movement, was founded and Ruben Um Nyobe took over as its leader. In May 1955, the arrests of independence activists were followed by riots in several cities across the country. The repression caused several dozen (the French administration officially lists twenty-two, although secret reports acknowledge many more) or hundreds of deaths. The UPC was banned and nearly 800 of its activists were arrested, many of whom would be beaten in prison. Wanted by the police, UPC activists take refuge in the forests, where they formed maquis, or in neighbouring British Cameroon. The French authorities repressed these events, and made arbitrary arrests. The party received the support of personalities such as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Kwame Nkrumah and France's action was denounced at the UN by representatives of countries such as India, Syria and the Soviet Union.<ref name=modo>Thomas Deltombe, Manuel Domergue, Jacob Tatsita, Kamerun !, La D\u00e9couverte, 2019</ref>\n\nAn insurrection broke out among the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa people]] on the night of 18 to 19 December 1956: several dozen anti-UPC figures were murdered or kidnapped, bridges, telephone lines and other infrastructure were sabotaged. Units of the Cameroonian guard violently repressed these events, which led to the rallying of the peasants to the maquis. Several UPC maquis were formed with their \"generals\" and \"captains\" leading \"regiments\" (150\u2013200 guerrillas) and \"battalions\" (50 guerrillas). The weapons were very basic: a few stolen guns and pistols, but mainly machetes, clubs, bows and arrows. To isolate the rebellion from the Bassa civilian population, who were suspected of being particularly independentist, they were deported to camps along the main roads. General Lamberton, in charge of the French forces, ordered: \"Any huts or installations remaining outside the assembly areas must be completely razed and their surrounding crops destroyed. \"Villagers were subjected to forced labour on behalf of Razel, particularly in road construction. The Bassa living in the city were expelled to their region of origin to prevent the \"virus of protest\" from spreading. This rebellion continued, with diminishing intensity, even after independence until 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/britishfrench-cameroon-1948-1961/|title=8.

On 5 December 1958, the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly took note of the French government\u2019s declaration according to which French Cameroon, which was under French administration, would gain independence on 1 January 1960, thus marking an end to the trusteeship period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroon50.cm/en/history-and-presentation/167-tutelle-a-independance.html |title=From trusteeship to independence (1946\u20131960) |accessdate=2011-12-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027131756/http://www.cameroon50.cm/en/history-and-presentation/167-tutelle-a-independance.html |archivedate=27 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Question of the future of the Trust Territories of the Cameroons under French administration and the Cameroons under United Kingdom administration|id=A/RES/1282(XIII) |url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1282(XIII)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> On 13 March 1959, the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly resolved that the UN Trusteeship Agreement with France for French Cameroon would end when French Cameroon became independent on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=The future of the Trust Territories of the Cameroons under French administration|id=A/RES/1349(XIII) |url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1349(XIII)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==British Cameroon==\n[[File:Cameroon boundary changes.PNG|300px|thumb|left|Cameroon 1901\u20131972 {{legend|#ff8040|German [[Kamerun]]}} {{legend|red|British Cameroons}} {{legend|blue|[[French Cameroun]]}} {{legend|green|Republic of [[Cameroon]]}}]]\nThe area of present-day Cameroon was claimed by [[Germany]] as a [[protectorate]] during the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\" at the end of the 19th century. The [[German Empire]] named the territory [[Kamerun]].\n\n===League of Nations Mandate===\nDuring the [[First World War]], it was occupied by British, [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops, and a later [[League of Nations Mandate]] to Great Britain and France by the [[League of Nations]] in 1922. The French mandate was known as [[Cameroun]] and the British territory was administered as two areas, '''[[Northern Cameroons]]''' and '''[[Southern Cameroons]]'''. Northern Cameroons consisted of two non-contiguous sections, divided by a point where the Nigerian and Cameroun borders met.  In the 1930s, most of the white population consisted of [[Germans]], which were interned in British camps starting in June 1940. The native population of 400,000 showed little interest in volunteering for the British forces; only 3,500 men did so.<ref>I.C.B Dear, ed, ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) p 163</ref>\n\n===Trust territory===\nWhen the [[League of Nations]] ceased to exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were reclassified as [[UN trust territory|UN trust territories]], henceforth administered through the [[UN Trusteeship Council]]. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence. The United Nations approved the Trusteeship Agreements for British Cameroons to be governed by Britain on 6 December 1946.\n\n===Independence===\nFrench Cameroun became independent, as Cameroun or Cameroon, in January 1960, and Nigeria was scheduled for independence later that same year, which raised question of what to do with the British territory. After some discussion (which had been going on since 1959), a [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|plebiscite]] was agreed to and held on 11 February 1961. The Muslim-majority Northern area opted for union with Nigeria, and the Southern area voted to join Cameroon.<ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p177 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>\n\nNorthern Cameroons became the [[Sardauna, Nigeria|Sardauna Province]] of [[Northern Nigeria]]<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HCoSuJMof9EC&lpg=PA155&dq=%22northern%20cameroons%22%20%22sardauna%20province%22&pg=PA155#v=onepage&q=%22northern%20cameroons%22%20%22sardauna%20province%22&f=false ''Parties and Politics in Northern Nigeria''], Routledge, 1968, page 155</ref> on 31 May 1961, while Southern Cameroons became West Cameroon, a constituent state of the [[Federal Republic of Cameroon]], later that year on 1 October 1961.\n\n==Cameroon after independence==\n[[File:Flag of Cameroon (1961-1975).svg|thumbnail|1961\u20131975]]\n[[File:Monument Reunification.jpg|thumb|[[Reunification Monument (Cameroon)|Reunification Monument]] in [[Yaound\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrench Cameroon achieved independence on January 1, 1960 as '''La Republique du Cameroun'''. After [[Guinea]], it was the second of France's colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa to become independent. On 21 February 1960, the new nation held a constitutional referendum. On 5 May 1960, [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] became president. On 11 February 1961, a [[plebiscite]] organised by the United Nations was held in the British controlled part of Cameroon (British Northern and British Southern Cameroons). The pleibiscite was to choose between free association with an independent Nigerian state or re-unification with the independent Republic of Cameroun. On 12 February 1961,the results of the plebiscite were released and British Northern Cameroons attached itself to Nigeria, while the southern part voted for reunification with the Republic Of Cameroon. To negotiate the terms of this union, the [[Foumban Conference]] was held on 16\u201321 July 1961. [[John Ngu Foncha]], the leader of the [[Kamerun National Democratic Party]] . The British Southern Cameroons was to be referred to as West Cameroon and the French part as East Cameroon. Buea became the capital of the now West Cameroon while Yaounde doubled as the federal capital and East Cameroon. Ahidjo accepted the federation, thinking it was a step towards a unitary state. On 14 August 1961, the federal constitution was adopted, with Ahidjo as president. Foncha became the prime minister of west Cameroon and vice president of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. On 1 September 1966 the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU) was created by the union of political parties of East and West Cameroon. Most decisions about West Cameroon were taken without consultation, which led to widespread feelings  amongst the West Cameroonian public that although they voted for reunification, what they were getting is absorption or domination\".<ref>The Untold Story of Reunification: (1955\u20131961)</ref>\n\nDuring the first years of the regime, the French ambassador Jean-Pierre B\u00e9nard is sometimes considered as the true \"president\" of Cameroon. This independence is indeed largely theoretical since French \"advisers\" are responsible for assisting each minister and have the reality of power. The [[Gaullist]] government preserves its influence over the country through the signing of \"cooperation agreements\" covering all sectors of Cameroon's sovereignty. Thus, in the monetary field, Cameroon retains the [[CFA franc]] and entrusts its monetary policy to its former guardian power. All strategic resources are exploited by France, French troops are maintained in the country, and a large proportion of Cameroonian army officers are French, including the Chief of Staff.<ref name=modo />\n\nOn October 1, 1961, the largely Muslim northern two-thirds of [[British Cameroons]] voted to join Nigeria; the largely Christian southern third, [[Southern Cameroons]], voted, in a referendum, to join with the Republic of Cameroon to form the '''Federal Republic of Cameroon'''. The formerly French and British regions each maintained substantial [[Self-governance|autonomy]]. Ahidjo was chosen president of the federation in 1961. In 1962, the Francs CFA became the official currency in Cameroon.\n\nThe authorities are multiplying the legal provisions enabling them to free themselves from the rule of law: arbitrary extension of police custody, prohibition of meetings and rallies, submission of publications to prior censorship, restriction of freedom of movement through the establishment of passes or curfews, prohibition for trade unions to issue subscriptions, etc. Anyone accused of \"compromising public safety\" is deprived of a lawyer and cannot appeal the judgment. Sentences of life imprisonment at hard labour or death penalty \u2013 executions can be public \u2013 are thus numerous. A one-party system was introduced in 1966.<ref name=modo />\n\nAhidjo successfully suppressed the continuing UPC rebellion, capturing the last important rebel leader in 1970. On 28 March 1970 Ahidjo renewed his mandate as the supreme magistracy; [[Solomon Tandeng Muna]]  became Vice President. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state called the '''United Republic of Cameroon'''. \nAlthough Ahidjo's rule was characterised as authoritarian, he was seen as noticeably lacking in charisma in comparison to many post-colonial African leaders. He didn't follow the anti-western policies pursued by many of these leaders, which helped Cameroon achieve a degree of comparative political stability and economic growth.\n\nCameroon became an oil-producing country in 1977. Claiming to want to make reserves for difficult times, the authorities manage \"off-budget\" oil revenues in total opacity (the funds are placed in [[Paris]], [[Switzerland]] and [[New York City|New York]] accounts). Several billion dollars are thus diverted to the benefit of oil companies and regime officials. The influence of France and its 9,000 nationals in Cameroon remains considerable. African Affairs magazine noted in the early 1980s that they \"continue to dominate almost all key sectors of the economy, much as they did before independence. French nationals control 55% of the modern sector of the Cameroonian economy and their control over the banking system is total<ref name=modo />\n\nOn 30 June 1975 [[Paul Biya]] was appointed vice president. Ahidjo resigned as president in 1982 and was constitutionally succeeded by his [[Prime Minister]], [[Paul Biya]], a career official. Ahidjo later regretted his choice of successors, but his supporters failed to overthrow Biya in a [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|1984 coup]]. Biya won single-candidate elections in 1983 and 1984 when the country was again named the '''Republic of Cameroon'''.  Biya has remained in power, winning flawed multiparty elections in 1992, 1997, 2004 and 2011. His [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) party holds a sizeable majority in the legislature.\n\nBy April 6, 1984, the country witnessed its first coup d'\u00e9tat headed by col. Issa Adoum.\nAt about 3 am rebel forces mostly of the Republican guard under the orders of colonel Ibrahim Saleh, attempted to '''unseat Biya's government.''' The rebels took charge of the Yaounde airport, national radio station and announced the takeover of government. They attacked the presidency. The civilian northerner who was manager of FONADER '''Issa Adoum''' was expected to become the new interim president. Unfortunately, many reasons led to its failure.\nThe principal coup plotters had been arrested by April 10, 1984 and President Biya addressed the nation that calm had been restored.\n\nOn August 15, 1984, [[Lake Monoun]] exploded in a [[limnic eruption]] that released [[carbon dioxide]], [[Asphyxia|suffocating]] 37 people to death. On August 21, 1986, another limnic eruption at [[Lake Nyos]] killed as many as 1,800 people and 3,500 livestock.  The two disasters are the only recorded instances of limnic eruptions.\n\nIn May 2014, in the wake of the [[Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]], Presidents [[Paul Biya]] of Cameroon and [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] of [[Chad]] announced they were waging war on [[Boko Haram]], and deployed troops to the Nigerian border.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Cameroon, Chad Deploy Troops to Fight Boko Haram \u2013 Nigeria\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/cameroon-chad-deploy-troops-fight-boko-haram\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| last = Kaze\n| first = Rennier\n| title = Dans le Nord du Cameroun, la \"guerre\" contre Boko Haram a commenc\u00e9 \u2013 Cameroon\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| date = 2014-06-06\n| language = French\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/dans-le-nord-du-cameroun-la-guerre-contre-boko-haram-commenc\n}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006 a final resolution to the dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich [[Bakassi peninsula]] was expected. In October 2002, the International Court of Justice had ruled in favour of Cameroon. Nonetheless, a lasting solution would require agreement by both countries\u2019 presidents, parliaments, and by the [[United Nations]]. The peninsula was the site of fighting between the two countries in 1994 and again in June 2005, which led to the death of a Cameroonian soldier. In 2006, Nigerian troops left the peninsula.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Boko Haram insurgency]] spread into Cameroon from Nigeria. Cameroon announced in September 2018 that Boko Haram had been repelled, but the conflict persists in the northern border areas nonetheless.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cameroon-boko-haram-1.4844513 Boko Haram has been repelled, Cameroon's leader declares], CBC, Sep 30, 2018.

In September 2017, the protests and the government's response to them escalated into an [[Anglophone Crisis|armed conflict]], with separatists declaring the independence of [[Ambazonia]] and starting a guerilla war against the Cameroonian Army.\n\n==Football==\nCameroon has received some international attention following the relative success of its [[Cameroon national football team|football team]]. It has qualified for the FIFA World Cup on a number of occasions. Its most notable performance was at [[Italia 90]], when the team beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], the then reigning Champions in the opening game; Cameroon eventually lost in extra time in the Quarterfinals to [[England national football team|England]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ambazonia]]\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[Politics of Cameroon]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Cameroon]]\n*[[List of heads of state of Cameroon]]\n* Douala [[Douala#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Douala|timeline]]\n* Yaound\u00e9 [[Yaounde#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Yaounde|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n* [https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm  Background Note: Cameroon] from the U.S. Department of State.\n* Bullock, A.

The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry & aware of other emotions. He terms this second nature as knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}\nHe finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relations with the outer material world. As a result, when we seek to know about the external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truths about things via what our senses convey to us.  However,  knowledge by identity, which we currently only give the awareness of human beings' existence, can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}\n\nHe finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. He finds that this process, which seems to be decent, is actually a circle of progress, as a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one's self and the outer (other) -self, results in luminous self-manifesting identity; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}<ref name=\"Integral yoga\">{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799\u2013800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}</ref>{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}\n\n[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity.

Jung defined intuition as \"perception via the unconscious\": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.<ref name=ptypes />\n\nJung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an \"intuitive type\", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, \"the natural champion of all minorities with a future\", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining\u2014even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others\u2014a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.<ref name=ptypes>C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Modern psychology===\nIn more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.<ref>Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.</ref>\n\n[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.<ref>Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.</ref>\n\nIntuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.<ref>AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication. Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24, 1978.</ref> In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non-intuitive subjects.<ref>AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing.

The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry & aware of other emotions. He terms this second nature as knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}\nHe finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relations with the outer material world. As a result, when we seek to know about the external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truths about things via what our senses convey to us.  However,  knowledge by identity, which we currently only give the awareness of human beings' existence, can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}\n\nHe finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. He finds that this process, which seems to be decent, is actually a circle of progress, as a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one's self and the outer (other) -self, results in luminous self-manifesting identity; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}<ref name=\"Integral yoga\">{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799\u2013800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}</ref>{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}\n\n[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity.

He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity.

Jung defined intuition as \"perception via the unconscious\": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.<ref name=ptypes />\n\nJung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an \"intuitive type\", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, \"the natural champion of all minorities with a future\", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining\u2014even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others\u2014a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.<ref name=ptypes>C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Modern psychology===\nIn more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.<ref>Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.</ref>\n\n[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.<ref>Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.</ref>\n\nIntuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.<ref>AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication. Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24, 1978.</ref> In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non-intuitive subjects.<ref>AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing.
