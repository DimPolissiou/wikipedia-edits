{"title_page": "Causes of the French Revolution", "text_new": "\n\nThere is significant disagreement among historians of the [[French Revolution]] as to its causes. Usually, they acknowledge the presence of several interlinked factors, but vary in the weight they attribute to each one. These factors include: cultural change, normally associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; social change, often emphasised by [[Marxism|Marxist]] historians; financial and economic difficulties; and the political actions of the involved parties.\n\n==Social background==\n|journal=European Review of Economic History |date=2000 |issue=4 |page=59-83 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}</ref> Under the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] they were part of the Third Estate, as they were  clergymen (the First Estate) or nobles (the Second Estate). Given their powerful economic position, and their aspirations on a class-wide level, the bourgeois wanted to ascend through the social hierarchy which was formalised, as aforementioned, into the Estate system. This is reflected by [[Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances|cahiers]] submitted by members of the Third Estate in March to April 1789: those of Carcassonne demanded that Louis \"''assure to the third estate the influence to which it is entitled in view of...its contribution to the public treasury''\".<ref>{{cite journal |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=James |title=Readings in European History |date=1906 |volume=2 |page=399 |publisher=Ginn |location=Boston}}</ref> This desire for higher social position resulted in high levels of bourgeois entryism into the Second Estate throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. This entryism was enabled by several factors, for example the poverty of many noble families meant that they married bourgeois families; the nobles gained bourgeois wealth, the bourgeois gained noble status. Moreover, corruption was rife, with many bourgeois simply attaching the noble particle 'de' to their name, or assuming nonexistent titles. Investigations into this behaviour were stopped in 1727. Furthermore, many governmental offices and positions were sold to raise cash - the bourgeois bought these positions and hence were ennobled; by 1765, 6,000 families had gained nobility through this method.<ref name=Kates>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kates |editor1-first=Gary |title=The French Revolution: Recent Debates & New Controversies |date=1998 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=44-70}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blacker |first1=J.

Furthermore, significant resentment was felt by the poorer members of the Third Estate (industrial and rural labourers), largely due to vast increases in the cost of living. From 1741 to 1785, there was a 62% increase in real cost of living. Due to a variety of factors, including poor harvests, in 1789 itself there was a 25% fall in real wages and an 88% increase in the price of bread. This resulted in anger at the establishment, that is the aristocracy and the King, who were perceived as being to blame for the economic crisis. Combined with this more immediate issue was an underlying problem of the inequality of land distribution; peasants made up approximately 80% of the French population, but only owned 35% of the land.<ref>Kates, pp. 23-43</ref> They were often tenant farmers who had to pay various dues to their noble landlords, taxes which were often disproportionately high in comparison to the peasant-farmers' income.  \n\nBeyond these relatively established facts regarding the social conditions surrounding the French Revolution, there is significant dissent among historians. Marxist historians, such as [[Henri Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] and [[Albert Soboul|Soboul]], see the social tensions described here as the main cause of the Revolution, as the Estates-General allowed them to manifest into tangible political action; the bourgeois and the lower classes were grouped into the Third Estate, allowing them to jointly oppose the establishment. Others see the social issues as important, but less so than the Enlightenment or the financial crisis; [[Fran\u00e7ois Furet]] is a prominent proponent of the former, [[Simon Schama]] of the latter.\n\n==Cultural change== \n{{see|Age of Enlightenment}}\nThere are two main points of view with regard to cultural change as a cause of the French Revolution; the direct influence of Enlightenment ideas on French citizens, meaning that they valued the ideas of liberty and equality discussed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] ''et al'', or the indirect influence of the Enlightenment insofar as it created a \"''philosophical society''\". The Enlightenment ideas were particularly popularised by the influence of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] on the soldiers who returned, and of [[Benjamin Franklin]] himself, who was a highly dynamic and engaging figure in the French court when he visited.<ref name=Schama>{{cite book |last1=Schama |first1=Simon |title=Citizens |date=1989 |publisher=Penguin Group |location=London |page=47}}</ref><ref>R.R. Palmer, ''The age of the Democratic Revolution: a political history of Europe and America, 1760\u20131800'' (2nd ed. 2014) pp. 177\u2013213</ref> The French publication of [[John Locke| Locke's]] [[Two Treatises of Government|''Treatises'']] in 1724 also played an important role in influencing both pre-Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary ideology.<ref>Kates, pp. 23-43</ref>\n\nProponents of the Enlightenment being a major cause, or indeed ''the'' major cause, of the French Revolution usually assert that the Estates-General was an opportunity for these ideas to be expressed. When the First and Second Estates, as well as the King, failed to respond to the Third Estates demands, they eschewed the authority of the King, resulting in the [[Tennis Court Oath]] and the subsequent development of the Revolution. Furet, the foremost proponent of the 'philosophical society' nuance to this view, says that the ideas of the Enlightenment were discussed in clubs and meetings \"''where rank and birth were second to...abstract argument''\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldstone |first1=Jack |title=Reinterpreting the French Revolution |journal=Theory and Society |date=1984 |volume=13 |issue=5 |page=697-713}}</ref> This resulted in a breakdown of the stratification that still divided the bourgeois and the nobles, fundamentally changing France's social organisation. As such, when the Estates-General was called, its rigid organisation into Third Estate and Second Estate conflicted with the new, informal organisation, and caused dissent; the Third Estate had attained equal status to the nobility, in their view, and when they demanded that the Estates meet as equals, the King's refusal triggered their secession from royal authority. Furet and others argue that the direct influence of Enlightenment ideas only played a part ''after'' the Revolution had begun, insofar as it was used to justify revolutionary action and fill the lack of central, guiding ideology that disillusionment with the monarchy had created.\n[[File:Rouget - Assembl\u00e9e des notables \u00e0 Rouen (4 novembre 1596).jpg|thumb|1822 depiction of the 1596 Assembly of Notables in Rouen]]\n\n==Financial crisis==\nThe financial crisis of the French crown played a role in both creating the social background to the Revolution, generating widespread anger at the Court, and (arguably most importantly) forcing Louis to call the Estates-General. The Court was deeply in debt, which in conjunction with a poor financial system, created a crisis.<ref>Eugene Nelson White, \"The French Revolution and the politics of government finance, 1770\u20131815.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 55#2 (1995): 227\u201355.</ref> In order to service the debt, given the Crown could find no more willing lenders, Louis attempted to call upon the nobility via an [[Assembly of Notables]]. However, the nobility refused to help - their power and influence had been steadily reduced since the reign of [[Louis XIV]] - and hence Louis was forced to rely upon the Estates-General. This meant that the discontented Third Estate (damaged by poor policy and low standards of living) were given the opportunity to air their grievances, and when they did not receive the desired response, the Revolution proper began; they denied the authority of the King and set up their own government.\n\n===Causes of debt===\nThe French Crown's debt was caused by both individual decisions, such as intervention in the War of Independence and the [[Seven Years' War]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter McPhee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLCnBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|title=The French Revolution|publisher=Melbourne U.|year=2015|isbn=978-0522866971|page=34}}</ref> and underlying issues such as an inadequate taxation system.

The Seven Years' War was even more costly, at 1.8 billion livres,<ref>Schama, pp. 65.</ref> and the war preceding that, the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] cost another billion livres.<ref>Schama, pp. 65.</ref> France faced an impossible dilemma: how to both maintain its international position and status by engaging in these conflicts, and how to fund them with an archaic and grossly inefficient system. \n[[Image:Trait\u00e9 de la Police par Nicolas de La Mare.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Le ''Trait\u00e9 de la Police''<br>by Nicolas de La Mare (1707): under the Ancien R\u00e9gime, the police regulated price, quality and supply of bread.]]\nThe financial system was ineffective in multiple ways. First, despite the [[House of Capet|Capet's]] attempts to limit their power, the nobility still wielded significant influence at Court; when Silhouette, a Controller-General, suggested taxing luxury items, he was removed from office due to noble opposition. Second, there was a system of tax immunities and feudal privileges that allowed many of France's wealthy citizens to avoid many taxes, notwithstanding the fact that few direct taxes were levied in the first place. The ''vingtieme'', a tax of 5% successively imposed on the nobility, was indeed paid, but this additional revenue was nowhere near enough to allow the Crown to maintain the levels of spending it needed, or wanted, to. The ''capitation'' was also imposed, a tax that varied with social status and the number of people in the family, but this too was insufficient. The tax that was collected, a significant sum, was fixed at certain levels at the government through a system of tax farming; private individuals and groups were asked to collect a fixed amount of tax on behalf of the government, and could keep any excess. When the government failed to accurately forecast the levels of tax that they ''could'' collect, they did not benefit from any increase in national output. Furthermore, due to the obvious financial difficulties of the French Crown and the lack of a central bank, lenders demanded higher interest rates to compensate them for the higher risk; France faced interest rates twice as high as Britain did, which further increased the cost of servicing the debt and hence worsened the Crown's problems.\n\n===Impact of financial ministers===\nOne of the ministers that Louis turned to in order to resolve the financial crisis was [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot| Turgot]], financial minister from 1774-1776. Turgot abolished the regulations surrounding the food supply, which to this point had been strictly controlled by the royal police: they monitored the purity of bread flour, prevented [[market manipulation|price manipulation]] via hoarding, and controlled the inflows and outflows of grain to regions facing good and bad harvests.<ref>[Andress, David.

Turgot was forced to restore regulation and repress the riots. Though resolved, the failed experiment led to deep distrust of the monarchy, with rumours of their intention to starve the war both prevalent and widely believed.\n\nIn 1783, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] was appointed as financial minister; Calonne, ahead of his time, advocated increasing public spending to drive up consumption and hence increase the country's GDP and tax revenues. However, this policy also failed, and only resulted in higher debt and France facing a primary deficit for the first time. The total fiscal deficit reached 140 million in 1787.<ref>Gilbert Faccarello,  \"Galiani, Necker and Turgot.

Lucas, for example, asserts that the bourgeois and nobility were not in fact that distinct, evidencing his argument with the bourgeois entryism and the ''a priori'' suggestion that it makes little sense for the bourgeois to attack a system that they are trying to become part of. Lucas places the break between bourgeois and nobles at the moment of the Estates-General, rather than earlier, asserting that it was only when the bourgeois were relegated to the Third Estate that they took issue with the nobility, seeing themselves as equated to \"''vulgar commoners''\".<ref>Kates, pp. 44-70</ref> Along the same lines, Behrens contests the traditional view of the failure of the tax system, arguing that the nobles in reality paid more tax than their English counterparts and that only one of the privileges enumerated by the [[Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique]] relates to taxation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Behrens |first1=Betty |title=Nobles, Privileges and Taxes in France at the End of the Ancien Regime |journal=The Economic History Review |date=1963 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=451-475}}</ref> Moreover, Lucas argues that many fiefs were owned by non-nobles - for example, in 1781 22% of the lay seigneurs in Le Mans weren't noble - and that commercial families, the bourgeois, also invested in land. Revisionist historians such as these also contest the view that the nobility were fundamentally opposed to change, noting that 160 signatories of the Tennis Court Oath had the particle 'de'.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Colin |title=Nobles, Bourgeois and the Origins of the French Revolution |journal=Past and Present |date=1973 |volume=60 |pages=84-126}}</ref> This is also a view advocated by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], who notes in his memoirs that \"''The severest blows struck against the ancient constitution of the State were delivered by noblemen.

Turgot abolished the regulations surrounding the food supply, which to this point had been strictly controlled by the royal police: they monitored the purity of bread flour, prevented [[market manipulation|price manipulation]] via hoarding, and controlled the inflows and outflows of grain to regions facing good and bad harvests.<ref>[Andress, David. French Society in Revolution, 1789\u20131799. France: Manchester University Press, 1999, pp. 16\u201318]</ref><ref>Steven Kaplan,Jean-Philippe de Tonnac, \"La France et son pain: Histoire d'une passion\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=UHA7fvHVBFkC&pg=PT94&dq=police+des+farines+ancien+r%C3%A9gime&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=l7kCVc-kLsrpUvuxgKAF&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=police%20des%20farines%20ancien%20r%C3%A9gime&f=false]</ref> This caused rampant [[speculation]] and a breakdown of interregional import-export dynamics; famine and dissent (the [[Flour War]]) ensued. Turgot was forced to restore regulation and repress the riots. Though resolved, the failed experiment led to deep distrust of the monarchy, with rumours of their intention to starve the war both prevalent and widely believed.\n\nIn 1783, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] was appointed as financial minister; Calonne, ahead of his time, advocated increasing public spending to drive up consumption and hence increase the country's GDP and tax revenues. However, this policy also failed, and only resulted in higher debt and France facing a primary deficit for the first time. The total fiscal deficit reached 140 million in 1787.<ref>Gilbert Faccarello,  \"Galiani, Necker and Turgot.

Lucas, for example, asserts that the bourgeois and nobility were not in fact that distinct, evidencing his argument with the bourgeois entryism and the ''a priori'' suggestion that it makes little sense for the bourgeois to attack a system that they are trying to become part of. Lucas places the break between bourgeois and nobles at the moment of the Estates-General, rather than earlier, asserting that it was only when the bourgeois were relegated to the Third Estate that they took issue with the nobility, seeing themselves as equated to \"''vulgar commoners''\".<ref>Kates, pp. 44-70</ref> Along the same lines, Behrens contests the traditional view of the failure of the tax system, arguing that the nobles in reality paid more tax than their English counterparts and that only one of the privileges enumerated by the [[Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique]] relates to taxation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Behrens |first1=Betty |title=Nobles, Privileges and Taxes in France at the End of the Ancien Regime |journal=The Economic History Review |date=1963 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=451-475}}</ref> Moreover, Lucas argues that many fiefs were owned by non-nobles - for example, in 1781 22% of the lay seigneurs in Le Mans weren't noble - and that commercial families, the bourgeois, also invested in land. Revisionist historians such as these also contest the view that the nobility were fundamentally opposed to change, noting that 160 signatories of the Tennis Court Oath had the particle 'de'.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Colin |title=Nobles, Bourgeois and the Origins of the French Revolution |journal=Past and Present |date=1973 |volume=60 |pages=84-126}}</ref> This is also a view advocated by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], who notes in his memoirs that \"''The severest blows struck against the ancient constitution of the State were delivered by noblemen.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)]]''\n| N/A\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], [[Ken Topolsky]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)]]''\n| N/A\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], [[Ken Topolsky]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by.

The series is a television reboot set in the 2010s and chronicle [[Norman Bates]]' early childhood with his mother and how she drove him to become a killer. In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]]. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie. The original interior sets have also been recreated.\n\n==Cast==\n===Principal cast===\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n*A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"14%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\"  | Original series\n!

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

{"title_page": "African-American literature", "text_new": "[[File:ToniMorrison WestPointLecture 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Toni Morrison]] lecture at [[West Point Military Academy]] in March 2013.]]\n\n'''African-American <!-- \"African American\" is a noun, \"African-American\" is an adjective --> literature''' is the body of [[literature]] produced in the United States by writers of African descent. It begins with the works of such late 18th-century writers as [[Phillis Wheatley]]. Before the high point of slave narratives, African-American literature was dominated by autobiographical spiritual narratives. The genre known as [[slave narratives]] in the 19th century were accounts by people who had generally escaped from slavery, about their journeys to freedom and ways they claimed their lives. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] of the 1920s was a great  period of flowering in literature and the arts, influenced both by writers who came North in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and those who were immigrants from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.  African-American writers have been recognized by the highest awards, including the [[Nobel Prize]] given to [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993. Among the themes and issues explored in this literature are the role of African Americans within the larger American society, African-American culture, [[racism]], [[slavery]], and [[social equality]]. African-American writing has tended to incorporate oral forms, such as [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[sermon]]s, [[gospel music]], [[blues]], or [[rapping|rap]].<ref>Jerry W. Ward, Jr., \"To Shatter Innocence: Teaching African American Poetry\", in ''Teaching African American Literature'', ed. M. Graham, Routledge, 1998, p. 146, {{ISBN|041591695X}}.</ref>\n\nAs African Americans' place in American society has changed over the centuries, so has the focus of African-American literature. Before the [[American Civil War]], the literature primarily consisted of memoirs by people who had escaped from slavery; the genre of [[slave narrative]]s included accounts of life under slavery and the path of justice and redemption to freedom. There was an early distinction between the literature of [[Freedman|freed slaves]] and the literature of [[Free negro|free blacks]] born in the North. Free blacks expressed their oppression in a different narrative form. Free blacks in the North often spoke out against slavery and racial injustices by using the spiritual narrative. The spiritual addressed many of the same themes of slave narratives, but has been largely ignored in current scholarly conversation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830\u20131880)|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8135-2514-3|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, non-fiction works by authors such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Booker T. Washington]] debated how to confront racism in the United States. During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], authors such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] wrote about issues of [[racial segregation]] and [[black nationalism]]. Today, African-American literature has become accepted as an integral part of [[American literature]], with books such as ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]], ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982) by [[Alice Walker]], which won the [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by Toni Morrison achieving both best-selling and award-winning status.\n\nIn broad terms, African-American literature can be defined as writings by people of African descent living in the United States. It is highly varied.<ref>Darryl Dickson-Carr, ''The Columbia Guide to Contemporary African American Fiction'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 10-11, {{ISBN|0-231-12472-4}}.</ref> African-American literature has generally focused on the role of African Americans within the larger American society and what it means to be an American.<ref name = \"Coon_p32\">Katherine Driscoll Coon, \"A Rip in the Tent: Teaching African American Literature\", in ''Teaching African American Literature'', ed. M. Graham, Routledge, 1998, p. 32, {{ISBN|041591695X}}.</ref> As [[Princeton University]] professor [[Albert J. Raboteau]] has said, all African-American study \"speaks to the deeper meaning of the African-American presence in this nation.  This presence has always been a test case of the nation's claims to freedom, democracy, equality, the inclusiveness of all.\"<ref name = \"Coon_p32\"/> African-American literature explores the issues of freedom and equality long denied to Blacks in the United States, along with further themes such as [[African-American culture]], racism, [[religion]], slavery, a sense of home,<ref>Valerie Sweeney Prince, ''Burnin' Down the House: Home in African American Literature'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-13440-1}}.</ref> segregation, migration, [[Black feminism|feminism]], and more. African-American literature presents experience from an African-American point of view.  In the early Republic, African-American literature represented a way for free blacks to negotiate their identity in an individualized republic. They often tried to exercise their political and social autonomy in the face of resistance from the white public.<ref>{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=Michael|title=Beyond Douglass: New Perspectives on Early African-American Literature|year=2008|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg|isbn=9780838757116|page=69}}</ref> Thus, an early theme of African-American literature was, like other American writings, what it meant to be a citizen in post-Revolutionary America.\n\n== Characteristics and themes ==\n\nAfrican-American literature has both been influenced by the great [[African diaspora|African diasporic]] heritage<ref>Dickson-Carr,''The Columbia Guide'', p. 73.</ref> and shaped it in many countries. It has been created within the larger realm of [[post-colonial literature]], although scholars distinguish between the two, saying that \"African American literature differs from most post-colonial literature in that it is written by members of a minority community who reside within a nation of vast wealth and economic power.\"<ref>Radhika Mohanram and Gita Rajan, ''English Postcoloniality: Literatures from Around the World'', Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1996, p. 135, {{ISBN|0313288542}}.</ref>\n\nAfrican-American oral culture is rich in poetry, including [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[gospel music]], [[blues]], and [[rapping|rap]]. This oral poetry also appears in the African-American tradition of Christian [[sermon]]s, which make use of deliberate repetition, cadence, and alliteration. African-American literature\u2014especially written poetry, but also prose\u2014has a strong tradition of incorporating all of these forms of oral poetry.<ref>Ward, Jr., \"To Shatter Innocence\", p. 146.</ref>  These characteristics do not occur in all works by African-American writers.\n\nSome scholars resist using Western literary theory to analyze African-American literature. As the [[Harvard]] literary scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] said, \"My desire has been to allow the black tradition to speak for itself about its nature and various functions, rather than to read it, or analyze it, in terms of literary theories borrowed whole from other traditions, appropriated from without.\"<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African American Literary Criticism'', New York: Oxford, 1988, p. xix, {{ISBN|0195034635}}.</ref> One trope common to African-American literature is \"[[Signifyin'|signifying]]\". Gates claims that signifying \u201cis a trope in which are subsumed several other rhetorical tropes, including [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]], and [[irony]], and also [[hyperbole]] and [[litotes]], and [[metalepsis]].\u201d<ref>Henry Louis Gates Jr. \"The Blackness of Blackness: A Critique of the Sign and the Signifying Monkey\", in Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan (eds), ''Literary Theory: An Anthology'', 2nd edn, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, p. 988.</ref> Signifying also refers to the way in which African-American \"authors read and critique other African American texts in an act of rhetorical self-definition\".<ref>Gates, \"The Blackness of Blackness\", in ''Literary Theory'' (2004), p. 992.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early African-American literature ===\n[[African-American history]] predates the emergence of the United States as an independent country, and African-American literature has similarly deep roots.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[Image:Phillis Wheatley frontispiece.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Phillis Wheatley (c.1753\u201384)]]\n\n[[Lucy Terry]] is the author of the oldest known piece of African-American literature, \"Bars Fight\". Terry wrote the ballad in 1746 after an Indian attack on [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. She was enslaved in Deerfield at the time of the attack, when many residents were killed and more than 100, mostly women and children, were taken on a forced march overland to Montreal. Some were later ransomed and redeemed by their families or community; others were adopted by Mohawk families, and some girls joined a French religious order. The ballad was first published in 1854, with an additional couplet, in ''The Springfield Republican''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adams|last2= Pleck|first1=Catherine|first2=Elizabeth|title=Love of Freedom: Black Women in Colonial and Revolutionary New England|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-538909-8|page=Kindle Location 1289}}</ref> and in 1855 in Josiah Holland\u2019s ''History of Western Massachusetts''.\n\nThe poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] (c.1753\u201384) published her book ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]]'' in 1773, three years before [[American independence]]. Wheatley was not only the first African American to publish a book, but the first to achieve an international reputation as a writer. Born in [[Senegal]], Wheatley was captured and sold into slavery at the age of seven. Brought to Massachusetts, she was owned by a [[Boston]] merchant. By the time she was 16, she had mastered her new language of English. Her poetry was praised by many of the leading figures of the [[American Revolution]], including [[George Washington]], who thanked her for a poem written in his honor. Some whites found it hard to believe that a Black woman could write such refined poetry. Wheatley had to defend herself in court to prove that she had written her own work. Some critics cite Wheatley's successful defense as the first recognition of African-American literature.{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}<ref name=\"Cashmore_Anthology\">{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}Ellis Cashmore, review of [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_n4331_v126/ai_19997743 ''The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517072635/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_n4331_v126/ai_19997743 |date=May 17, 2008 }}'', Nellie Y.

In 1778 he wrote an [[ode]] to Phillis Wheatley, in which he discussed their shared humanity and common bonds.\n\nIn 1786, Hammon gave his \"[[Address to the Negroes of the State of New York]]\". Writing at the age of 76 after a lifetime of slavery, Hammon said: \"If we should ever get to Heaven, we shall find nobody to reproach us for being black, or for being slaves.\" He also promoted the idea of gradual [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] as a way to end slavery.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/readex/20400.html An address to the Negroes in the state of New-York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128185140/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/readex/20400.html |date=November 28, 2009 }}, by Jupiter Hammon, servant of John Lloyd, Jun, Esq; of the manor of Queen's Village, Long-Island. 1778.</ref> Hammon is thought to have been a slave on [[Long Island]] until his death.

There he published his [[short story]] \"''[[Le Mul\u00e2tre]]''\" (\"The Mulatto\") in 1837. It is the first known fiction by an African American, but as it was written in French and published in a French journal, it had apparently no influence on later American literature.

Born into slavery in Kentucky, Brown was working on riverboats based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], when he escaped to Ohio. He began to work for abolitionist causes, making his way to [[Buffalo, New York]] and later [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He was a prolific writer, beginning with an account of his escape to freedom and experience under slavery. Brown wrote ''[[Clotel|Clotel; or, The President's Daughter]]'' (1853), considered to be the first novel written by an African American. It was based on the persistent rumor that president [[Thomas Jefferson]] had fathered a mixed-race daughter with his slave [[Sally Hemings]]. (In the late 20th century, DNA testing affirmed for most historians that Jefferson was the father of six children with Hemings; four survived to adulthood and he gave all their freedom.) The novel was first published in England, where Brown was living for several years.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/brown/summary.html \"William Wells Brown, 1814?-1884: Clotel; or, The President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave Life in the United States.

Crafts was a fugitive slave from [[Murfreesboro, North Carolina]]. If her work was written in 1853, it would be the first African-American novel written in the United States. The novel was published in 2002 with an introduction by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The work was never published during Crafts' lifetime.

They wanted to describe the cruelties of life under slavery, as well as the persistent humanity of the slaves as persons. At the time, the controversy over [[slavery]] led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue, with novels such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe's representing the abolitionist view of the evils of slavery. Southern white writers produced the \"[[Anti-Tom]]\" novels in response, purporting to truly describe life under slavery, as well as the more severe cruelties suffered by free labor in the North. Examples include ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Mary Henderson Eastman]] and ''The Sword and the Distaff'' (1853) by [[William Gilmore Simms]].\n\nThe slave narratives were integral to African-American literature. Some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the [[Caribbean]] wrote accounts of their lives, with about 150 of these published as separate books or pamphlets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Slave narratives can be broadly categorized into three distinct forms: tales of religious redemption, tales to inspire the abolitionist struggle, and tales of progress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The tales written to inspire the abolitionist struggle are the most famous because they tend to have a strong autobiographical motif. Many of them are now recognized as the most literary of all 19th-century writings by African Americans, with two of the best-known being [[Frederick Douglass]]'s autobiography and ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' by [[Harriet Jacobs]] (1861).\n\nJacobs (1813\u20131897) was born a slave in Edenton, North Carolina and was the first woman to author a slave narrative in the United States. Although her narrative ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was written under the pseudonym \"Linda Brent\", the autobiography can be traced through a series of letters from Jacobs to various friends and advisors, most importantly to [[Lydia Maria Child]], the eventual editor of incidents. The narrative details Jacobs' struggle for freedom, not only for herself but for her two children. Jacobs' narrative occupies an important place in the history of African-American literature as it discloses through her firsthand example the specific injustices that black women suffered under slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe was asked to write a foreword for Jacob's book, but refused.\n\n=== Frederick Douglass ===\n{{Main|Frederick Douglass}}\n[[File:Frederick Douglass (circa 1879).jpg|thumb|160px|Frederick Douglass]]\nFrederick Douglass (c. 1818\u20131895) first came to public attention in the North as an orator for abolition and as the author of a moving slave narrative. He eventually became the most prominent African American of his time and one of the most influential lecturers and authors in American history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/slave-route/resistances-and-abolitions/frederick-douglass/|title=The Slave Route: Who was Frederick Douglass?|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBorn into slavery in Maryland, Douglass eventually escaped and worked for numerous abolitionist causes. He also edited a number of newspapers. Douglass' best-known work is his autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which was published in 1845. At the time some critics attacked the book, not believing that a black man could have written such an eloquent work. Despite this, the book was an immediate bestseller.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/22/narrative-life-frederick-douglass-american-slave-review|title=The 100 best nonfiction books: No 68 \u2013 Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave by Frederick Douglass (1845)|last=McCrum|first=Robert|date=May 22, 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref> Douglass later revised and expanded his autobiography, which was republished as ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). In addition to serving in a number of political posts during his life, he also wrote numerous influential articles and essays.\n\n===Spiritual narratives===\n\nEarly African-American spiritual autobiographies were published in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Authors of such narratives include [[Ukawsaw Gronniosaw|James Gronniosaw]], [[John Marrant]], and George White. William L. Andrews argues that these early narratives \"gave the twin themes of the Afro-American 'pregeneric myth'\u2014knowledge and freedom\u2014their earliest narrative form\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=William|title=Sisters of the Spirit: Three Black Women's Autobiographies of the Nineteenth Century|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253352606|page=[https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/1 1]|url=https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/1}}</ref> These spiritual narratives were important predecessors of the slave narratives which proliferated the literary scene of the 19th century. These spiritual narratives have often been left out of the study of African-American literature because some scholars have deemed them historical or sociological documents, despite their importance to understanding African-American literature as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=5}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American women who wrote spiritual narratives had to negotiate the precarious positions of being black and women in early America. Women claimed their authority to preach and write spiritual narratives by citing the [[Epistle of James]], often calling themselves \"doers of the word\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=3}}</ref> The study of these women and their spiritual narratives are significant to the understanding of African-American life in the Antebellum North because they offer both historical context and literary tropes. Women who wrote these narratives had a clear knowledge of literary genres and biblical narratives. This contributed to advancing their message about African-American women\u2019s agency and countered the dominant racist and sexist discourse of early American society.\n\n[[Zilpha Elaw]] was born in 1790 in America to free parents. She was a preacher for five years in England without the support of a denomination.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=William|title=Sisters of the Spirit: Three Black Women's Autobiographies of the Nineteenth Century|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253352606|page=[https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/2 2]|url=https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/2}}</ref> She published her ''Memoirs of the Life, Religious Experience, Ministerial Travel and Labours of Mrs. Zilpha Elaw, an American Female of Colour'' in 1846, while still living in England. Her narrative was meant to be an account of her spiritual experience. Yet some critics argue that her work was also meant to be a literary contribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Frances Smith|title=Written By Herself: Literary Production by African American Women, 1746-1892|year=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253324092|page=[https://archive.org/details/writtenbyherself0000fost/page/84 84]|url=https://archive.org/details/writtenbyherself0000fost/page/84}}</ref> Elaw aligns herself in a literary tradition of respectable women of her time who were trying to combat the immoral literature of the time.<ref name=Foster85>{{cite book|last=Foster|title=Written By Herself|year=1993|location=|isbn=|page=85}}</ref>\n\n[[Maria W. Stewart]] published a collection of her religious writings with an autobiographical experience attached in 1879. The publication was called ''Meditations from the Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart''. She also had two works published in 1831 and 1832 titled ''Religion and the Pure Principles of Morality'' and ''Meditations''. Maria Stewart was known for her public speeches in which she talked about the role of black women and race relations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=57}}</ref> Her works were praised by [[Alexander Crummell]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. Stewart's works have been argued to be a refashioning of the [[jeremiad]] tradition and focus on the specific plight of African Americans in America during the period.<ref>Peterson, Carla. pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\u2013\n\n[[Jarena Lee]] published two religious autobiographical narratives: ''The Life and Religious Experience of Jarena Lee'' and ''Religious Experience and Journal of Mrs. Jarena Lee''. These two narratives were published in 1836 and 1849 respectively. Both works spoke about Lee's life as a preacher for the African Methodist Church. But her narratives were not endorsed by the Methodists because a woman preaching was contrary to their church doctrine.<ref>Ferguson, Moira, ''Nine Black Women'', p. 148.</ref> Some critics argue that Lee's contribution to African-American literature lies in her disobedience to the patriarchal church system and her assertion of women's rights within the Methodist Church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=74}}</ref>\n\n[[Nancy Prince]] was born in 1799, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], and was of African and Native American descent. She turned to religion at the age of 16 in an attempt to find comfort from the trials of her life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Moira|title=Nine Black Women|page=172}}</ref> She married Nero Prince and traveled extensively in the West Indies and Russia. She became a missionary and in 1841 she tried to raise funds for missionary work in the West Indies, publishing a pamphlet entitled ''The West Indies: Being a Description of the Islands, Progress of Christianity, Education, and Liberty Among the Colored Population Generally''. Later, in 1850, she published ''A Narrative of the Life and Travels of Mrs. Nancy Prince''. These publications were both spiritual narratives and travel narratives.<ref name=Foster85 /> Similar to Jarena Lee, Prince adhered to the standards of Christian religion by framing her unique travel narrative in a Christian perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|year=1993|title=Written by Herself|page=86}}</ref> Yet, her narrative poses a counter narrative to the 19th century's ideal of a demure woman who had no voice in society and little knowledge of the world.\n\n[[Sojourner Truth]] (1797\u20131883) was a leading advocate in both the abolitionist and feminist movements in the 19th century. Born Isabella to a wealthy Dutch master in [[Ulster County, New York]], she adopted the name Sojourner Truth after 40 years of struggle, first to attain her freedom and then to work on the mission she felt God intended for her. This new name was to \"signify the new person she had become in the spirit, a traveler dedicated to speaking the Truth as God revealed it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=245}}</ref> Truth played a significant role during the Civil War. She worked tirelessly on several civil rights fronts; she recruited black troops in Michigan, helped with relief efforts for freedmen and women escaping from the South, led a successful effort to desegregate the streetcars in Washington, D.C., and she counseled President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Truth never learned to read or write but in 1850, she worked with Olive Gilbert, a sympathetic white woman, to write the ''Narrative of Sojourner Truth''. This narrative was a contribution to both the slave narrative and female spiritual narratives.\n\n=== Post-slavery era ===\n\nAfter the end of slavery and the American Civil War, a number of African-American authors wrote nonfiction works about the condition of African Americans in the United States. Many African-American women wrote about the principles of behavior of life during the period.<ref>{{cite book | title=Her Prologue: The Novels of Black American Women | publisher=Greenwood | author=Watson, Carole M. | year=1985| author-link=Carole M. Watson }}</ref> [[African-American newspapers]] were a popular venue for essays, poetry and fiction as well as journalism, with newspaper writers like [[Jennie Carter]](1830\u20131881) developing a large following.<ref>Eric Gardner, ''Jennie Carter: A Black Journalist of the Early West'',  University Press of Mississippi, January 1, 2007.</ref>\n\nAmong the most prominent of post-slavery writers is [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] (1868\u20131963), who had a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard University, and was one of the original founders of the [[NAACP]] in 1910. At the turn of the century, Du Bois published a highly influential collection of essays entitled ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]''. The essays on race were groundbreaking and drew from Du Bois's personal experiences to describe how African Americans lived in rural Georgia and in the larger American society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Du Bois wrote: \"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line\",<ref>Du Bois, W.E.B. ''The Souls of Black Folk,'' Penguin Books, 1996, p. 10, {{ISBN|014018998X}}.</ref> a statement since considered prescient. Du Bois believed that African Americans should, because of their common interests, work together to battle prejudice and inequity. He was a professor at [[Atlanta University]] and later at [[Howard University]].\n\nAnother prominent author of this period is [[Booker T. Washington]] (1856\u20131915), who in many ways represented opposite views from Du Bois. Washington was an educator and the founder of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], a [[historically black college]] in Alabama. Among his published works are ''[[Up From Slavery]]'' (1901), ''The Future of the American Negro'' (1899), ''Tuskegee and Its People'' (1905), and ''My Larger Education'' (1911). In contrast to Du Bois, who adopted a more confrontational attitude toward ending racial strife in America, Washington believed that Blacks should first lift themselves up and prove themselves the equal of whites before asking for an end to racism. While this viewpoint was popular among some Blacks (and many whites) at the time, Washington's political views would later fall out of fashion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n[[Elizabeth Keckley]] (1818\u20131907) was a former slave who managed to establish a successful career as a dressmaker who catered to the Washington political elite after obtaining her freedom. However, soon after publishing ''Behind the Scenes; or, Thirty Years as a Slave and Four Years in the White House'', she lost her job and found herself reduced to doing odd jobs. Although she acknowledged the cruelties of her enslavement and her resentment towards it, Keckley chose to focus her narrative on the incidents that \"moulded her character\", and on how she proved herself \"worth her salt\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=365}}</ref> ''Behind the Scenes'' details Keckley's life in slavery, her work for [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] and her efforts to obtain her freedom. Keckley was also deeply committed to programs of racial improvement and protection and helped found the Home for Destitute Women and Children in Washington, D.C., as a result. In addition to this, Keckley taught at Wilberforce University in Ohio.\n\n[[Josephine Brown]] (born 1839), the youngest child of abolitionist and author [[William Wells Brown]], wrote a biography of her father, ''Biography of an American Bondman, By His Daughter''. Brown wrote the first ten chapters of the narrative while studying in France, as a means of satisfying her classmates' curiosity about her father. After returning to America, she discovered that the narrative of her father\u2019s life, written by him, and published a few years before, was out of print and thus produced the rest of the chapters that constitute ''Biography of an American Bondman''. Brown was a qualified teacher but she was also extremely active as an advocate against slavery.\n\nAlthough not a US citizen, the [[Jamaica]]n [[Marcus Garvey]] (1887\u20131940), was a newspaper publisher, journalist, and activist for [[Pan Africanism]] who became well known in the United States. He founded the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] (UNIA). He encouraged black nationalism and for people of African ancestry to look favorably upon their ancestral homeland. He wrote a number of essays published as editorials in the UNIA house organ, the ''[[Negro World]]'' newspaper. Some of his lecture material and other writings were compiled and published as nonfiction books by his second wife [[Amy Jacques Garvey]] as the ''Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey Or, Africa for the Africans'' (1924) and ''More Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey'' (1977).\n\n[[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], who often wrote in the rural, [[African American Vernacular English|black dialect]] of the day, was the first African-American poet to gain national prominence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/paul-laurence-dunbar|title=Paul Laurence Dunbar|last=Dunbar|first=Paul Laurence|date=2000-07-14|website=Paul Laurence Dunbar|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref> His first book of poetry, ''Oak and Ivy'', was published in 1893. Much of Dunbar's work, such as ''When Malindy Sings'' (1906), which includes photographs taken by the [[Hampton Institute]] Camera Club, and ''Joggin' Erlong'' (1906) provide revealing glimpses into the lives of rural African Americans of the day. Though Dunbar died young, he was a prolific poet, essayist, novelist (among them ''The Uncalled'', 1898 and ''The Fanatics'', 1901) and short story writer.\n\nOther African-American writers also rose to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among these is [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], a well-known short story writer and essayist. [[Mary Weston Fordham]] published ''Magnolia Leaves'' in 1897, a book of poetry on religious, spiritual, and occasionally feminist themes with an introduction by [[Booker T. Washington]].\n\n[[Frances E. W. Harper]] (1825\u20131911) wrote four novels, several volumes of poetry, and numerous stories, poems, essays and letters. Born to free parents in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper received an uncommonly thorough education at her uncle, William Watkins' school. In 1853, publication of Harper\u2019s ''Eliza Harris'', which was one of many responses to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin]]'', brought her national attention. Harper was hired by the Maine Anti-Slavery Society and in the first six weeks, she managed to travel to twenty cities, giving at least thirty-one lectures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=491}}</ref>  Her book ''Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects'', a collection of poems and essays prefaced by [[William Lloyd Garrison]], was published in 1854 and sold more than 10,000 copies within three years. Harper was often characterized as \"a noble Christian woman\" and \"one of the most scholarly and well-read women of her day\", but she was also known as a strong advocate against slavery and the post-Civil War repressive measures against blacks.\n\n=== Harlem Renaissance ===\n{{Main|Harlem Renaissance}}\nThe [[Harlem Renaissance]] from 1920 to 1940 was a flowering of African-American literature and art. Based in the African-American community of [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] in [[New York City]], it was part of a larger flowering of social thought and culture. Numerous Black artists, musicians and others produced classic works in fields from jazz to theater; the renaissance is perhaps best known for the literature that came out of it.\n\n[[Image:LangstonHughes.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Langston Hughes, photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1936]]\n\nAmong the most renowned writers of the renaissance is poet [[Langston Hughes]], whose first work was published in ''[[The Brownies' Book]]'' in 1921.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://childlit.unl.edu/topics/edi.brownies.html|encyclopedia=The Tar Baby and the Tomahawk:Race and Ethnic Images in American Children's Literature, 1880-1939|title=The Brownies' Book|others=Center for Digital Research in the Humanities ([[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]]) and Center for the Humanities ([[Washington University in St. Louis]])|publisher=Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln}}</ref> He first received attention in the 1922 publication ''The Book of American Negro Poetry''. Edited by [[James Weldon Johnson]], this anthology featured the work of the period's most talented poets, including [[Claude McKay]], who also published three novels, ''Home to Harlem'', ''Banjo'' and ''Banana Bottom,'' a nonfiction book, \"Harlem: Negro Metropolis\" and a collection of short stories. In 1926, Hughes published a collection of poetry, ''The Weary Blues'', and in 1930 a novel, ''Not Without Laughter''. Perhaps his most famous poem is \"[[The Negro Speaks of Rivers]]\", which he wrote as a young teen. His single, most recognized character is Jesse B. Simple, a plainspoken, pragmatic [[Harlem]]ite whose comedic observations appeared in Hughes's columns for the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]''. ''Simple Speaks His Mind'' (1950) is perhaps the best-known collection of Simple stories published in book form. Until his death in 1967, Hughes published nine volumes of poetry, eight books of short stories, two novels and a number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[children's books]] and translations.\n\nAnother notable writer of the renaissance is novelist [[Zora Neale Hurston]], author of the classic novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (1937). Although Hurston wrote 14 books that ranged from [[anthropology]] to [[short stories]] to novel-length fiction, her writings fell into obscurity for decades. Her work was rediscovered in the 1970s through a 1975 article by [[Alice Walker]], \"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\", published in ''Ms. magazine''. Walker found in Hurston a role model for all female African-American writers.\n\nWhile Hurston and Hughes are the two most influential writers to come out of the Harlem Renaissance, a number of other writers also became well known during this period. They include [[Jean Toomer]], author of ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'', a famous collection of stories, poems, and sketches about rural and urban Black life, and [[Dorothy West]], whose novel ''The Living is Easy'' examined the life of an [[upper-class]] Black family. Another popular renaissance writer is [[Countee Cullen]], who in his poems described everyday black life (such as a trip he made to Baltimore that was ruined by a racial insult). Cullen's books include the poetry collections ''Color'' (1925), ''Copper Sun'' (1927), and ''The Ballad of the Brown Girl'' (1927). [[Frank Marshall Davis]]'s poetry collections ''Black Man's Verse'' (1935) and ''I am the American Negro'' (1937), published by [[Black Cat Press]], earned him critical acclaim. Author [[Wallace Thurman]] also made an impact with his novel ''[[The Blacker the Berry (novel)|The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life]]'' (1929), which focused on intraracial prejudice between lighter-skinned and darker-skinned African Americans.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance marked a turning point for African-American literature. Prior to this time, books by African Americans were primarily read by other Black people. With the renaissance, though, African-American literature\u2014as well as black fine art and performance art\u2014began to be absorbed into mainstream American culture.\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement era ===\n\nA large migration of African Americans began during [[World War I]], hitting its high point during [[World War II]]. During this [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], Black people left the racism and lack of opportunities in the American South and settled in northern cities such as [[Chicago]], where they found work in factories and other sectors of the economy.<ref>David M.

The migration also empowered the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]], which made a powerful impression on Black writers during the 1940s, '50s and '60s. Just as Black activists were pushing to end segregation and racism and create a new sense of Black nationalism, so too were Black authors attempting to address these issues with their writings.\n\nOne of the first writers to do so was [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], whose work addressed issues of race and [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Baldwin, who is best known for his novel ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)|Go Tell It on the Mountain]]'', wrote deeply personal stories and essays while examining what it was like to be both Black and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] at a time when neither of these identities was accepted by American culture. In all, Baldwin wrote nearly 20 books, including such classics as ''[[Another Country (novel)|Another Country]]'' and ''[[The Fire Next Time]]''.\n\nBaldwin's idol and friend was author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], whom Baldwin called \"the greatest Black writer in the world for me\". Wright is best known for his novel ''[[Native Son]]'' (1940), which tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a Black man struggling for acceptance in Chicago. Baldwin was so impressed by the novel that he titled a collection of his own essays ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'', in reference to Wright's novel. However, their friendship fell apart due to one of the book's essays, \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" which criticized ''Native Son'' for lacking credible characters and psychological complexity. Among Wright's other books are the autobiographical novel ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945), ''[[The Outsider (Wright novel)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), and ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957).\n\nThe other great novelist of this period is [[Ralph Ellison]], best known for his novel ''[[Invisible Man (novel)|Invisible Man]]'' (1952), which won the [[National Book Award]] in 1953. Even though he did not complete another novel during his lifetime, ''Invisible Man'' was so influential that it secured his place in literary history. After Ellison's death in 1994, a second novel, ''[[Juneteenth (novel)|Juneteenth]]'' (1999), was pieced together from the 2,000-plus pages he had written over 40 years. A fuller version of the manuscript was published as ''[[Three Days Before the Shooting]]'' (2010).\n<!-- Jones, Edward, ''The Known World'', 2003\nCarter Stephen, ''New England White'' 2007\nWright W.D. ''Crisis of the Black Intellectual'', 2007-->\n\n[[Image:Ralph Ellison photo portrait seated.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Ralph Ellison circa 1961]]\n\nThe Civil Rights time period also saw the rise of female Black poets, most notably [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], who became the first African American to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] when it was awarded for her 1949 book of poetry, ''[[Annie Allen]]''. Along with Brooks, other female poets who became well known during the 1950s and '60s are [[Nikki Giovanni]] and [[Sonia Sanchez]].\n\nDuring this time, a number of playwrights also came to national attention, notably [[Lorraine Hansberry]], whose play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' focuses on a poor Black family living in Chicago. The play won the 1959 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. Another playwright who gained attention was [[Amiri Baraka]], who wrote controversial off-Broadway plays. In more recent years, Baraka became known for his poetry and music criticism.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of important essays and books about human rights were written by the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. One of the leading examples of these is [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]'s \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\".\n\n===Recent history===\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, African-American literature reached the mainstream as books by Black writers continually achieved best-selling and award-winning status. This was also the time when the work of African-American writers began to be accepted by academia as a legitimate genre of American literature.<ref>Ronald Roach, \"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_n15_v14/ai_20318388 Powerful pages\u2014unprecedented public impact of W.W.

A number of scholars and writers are generally credited with helping to promote and define African-American literature as a genre during this time period, including fiction writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and poet [[James Emanuel]].\n\nJames Emanuel took a major step toward defining African-American literature when he edited (with Theodore Gross) ''Dark Symphony: Negro Literature in America'' (1968), a collection of black writings released by a major publisher.<ref name=\"James\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003041.pdf James A. Emanuel: A Register of His Papers in the Library of Congress], prepared by T. Michael Womack, Manuscript Division, [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C., 2000. Accessed May 6, 2006.</ref> This anthology, and Emanuel's work as an educator at the [[City College of New York]] (where he is credited with introducing the study of [[African-American]] poetry), heavily influenced the birth of the genre.<ref name=\"James\" /> Other influential African-American anthologies of this time included ''Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing'', edited by [[LeRoi Jones]] (now known as Amiri Baraka) and Larry Neal in 1968; ''The Negro Caravan'', co-edited by [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]], [[Arthur P. Davis]] and [[Ulysses Lee]] in 1969; and ''We Speak As Liberators: Young Black Poets \u2014 An Anthology'', edited by [[Orde Coombs]] and published in 1970.\n\n[[Toni Morrison]], meanwhile, helped promote Black literature and authors  in the 1960s and '70s when she worked as an editor for [[Random House]], where she edited books by such authors as [[Toni Cade Bambara]] and [[Gayl Jones]]. Morrison herself would later emerge as one of the most important African-American writers of the 20th century. Her first novel, ''The Bluest Eye'', was published in 1970. Among her most famous novels is ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1988. This story describes a slave who found freedom but killed her infant daughter to save her from a life of slavery. Another important Morrison novel is ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', a tale about [[materialism]], [[unrequited love]], and brotherhood. Morrison is the first African American to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nIn the 1970s novelist and poet [[Alice Walker]] wrote a famous essay that brought [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and her classic novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' back to the attention of the literary world. In 1982, Walker won both the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the [[American Book Award]] for her novel ''[[The Color Purple]]''. An [[epistolary novel]] (a book written in the form of letters), ''The Color Purple'' tells the story of Celie, a young woman who is sexually abused by her stepfather and then is forced to marry a man who physically [[spousal abuse|abuses]] her.  The novel was later made into a film by [[Steven Spielberg]].\n\nThe 1970s also saw African-American books topping the bestseller lists. Among the first to do so was ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]]. A fictionalized account of Haley's family history\u2014beginning with the kidnapping of his ancestor [[Kunta Kinte]] in [[The Gambia|Gambia]] through his life as a slave in the United States\u2014''Roots'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and became a popular television [[miniseries]]. Haley also wrote ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'' in 1965.\n\nOther important writers in recent years include [[literary fiction]] writers Gayl Jones, [[Rasheed Clark]], [[Ishmael Reed]], [[Jamaica Kincaid]], [[Randall Kenan]], and [[John Edgar Wideman]]. African-American poets have also garnered attention. [[Maya Angelou]] read a poem at [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration, [[Rita Dove]] won a Pulitzer Prize and served as [[Poet Laureate]] of the United States from 1993 to 1995, and [[Cyrus Cassells]]'s ''Soul Make a Path through Shouting'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1994. Cassells is a recipient of the [[William Carlos Williams Award]]. [[Natasha Trethewey]] won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry with her book ''Native Guard''. Lesser-known poets such as [[Thylias Moss]] also have been praised for their innovative work. Notable black playwrights include [[Ntozake Shange]], who wrote ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]'' (1976), [[Ed Bullins]], [[Suzan-Lori Parks]], and the prolific [[August Wilson]], who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his plays. More recently, [[Edward P. Jones]] won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for ''[[The Known World]]'' (2003), his novel about a black slaveholder in the [[Antebellum Era in the United States|antebellum]] South.\n\nYounger African-American novelists include [[David Anthony Durham]], [[Karen E. Quinones Miller]], [[Tayari Jones]], [[Kalisha Buckhanon]], [[Mat Johnson]], [[ZZ Packer]] and [[Colson Whitehead]], to name a few. African-American literature has also crossed over to [[genre fiction]]. A pioneer in this area is [[Chester Himes]], who in the 1950s and '60s wrote a series of [[mass market paperback|pulp fiction]] detective novels featuring \"Coffin\" Ed Johnson and \"Gravedigger\" Jones, two New York City police detectives. Himes paved the way for the later crime novels of [[Walter Mosley]] and [[Hugh Holton]]. African Americans are also represented in the genres of science fiction, fantasy and horror, with [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Octavia E. Butler]], [[Steven Barnes]], [[Tananarive Due]], [[Robert Fleming (author)|Robert Fleming]], [[Brandon Massey]], [[Charles R. Saunders]], [[John Ridley]], [[John M. Faucette]], [[Sheree Thomas]] and [[Nalo Hopkinson]] being just a few of the well-known authors.\n\nFinally, African-American literature has gained added attention through the work of talk-show host [[Oprah Winfrey]], who repeatedly has leveraged her fame to promote literature through the medium of her [[Oprah's Book Club]]. At times, she has brought African-American writers a far broader audience than they otherwise might have received.\n\n[[Hip-hop]] literature has become popular recently popular in the African-American community.<ref>Beauty Bragg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40587216?seq=1 Review of ''Writing the Future of Black America: Literature of the Hip-Hop Generation'' by Daniel Grassian], in ''[[MELUS]]'', Vol. 35, No. 1, Transgressing the Borders of \"America\" (Spring 2010), pp. 184\u2013186.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, the [[Internet]] has facilitated publication of African-American literature. Founded in 1996 by Memphis Vaughn, TimBookTu has been a pioneer offering an online audience poetry, fiction, essays and other forms of the written word.[http://www.timbooktu.com/index.html]\n\n== Critiques ==\n\nWhile African-American literature is well accepted in the United States, there are numerous views on its significance, traditions, and theories. To the genre's supporters, African-American literature arose out of the experience of Blacks in the United States, especially with regards to historic racism and discrimination, and is an attempt to refute the dominant culture's literature and power. In addition, supporters see the literature existing both within and outside [[American literature]] and as helping to revitalize the country's writing. To critics {{Who|date=August 2011}}, African-American literature is part of a [[Balkanization]] of American literature. In addition, there are some within the African-American community who do not like how their own literature sometimes showcases Black people.\n\n=== Refuting the dominant literary culture ===\n\nThroughout American history, African Americans have been discriminated against and subject to racist attitudes.  This experience inspired some Black writers, at least during the early years of African-American literature, to prove they were the equals of European-American authors.  As Henry Louis Gates, Jr, has said, \"it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture.\"<ref name = \"Stryz_p140\">\"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter\" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.</ref>\n\nBy refuting the claims of the dominant culture, African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States.  Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as \"something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity.\"<ref name = \"Stryz_p140\"/>  This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination.  By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke \"the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power.\"<ref>Quote from Marjorie Pryse in \"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter\" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.</ref> In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, perhaps most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name = \"jhu_theory\">Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html \"African-American Theory and Criticism\"] (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref>\n\n===Existing both inside and outside American literature===\n\nAccording to Joanne Gabbin, a professor, African-American literature exists both inside and outside American literature. \"Somehow African American literature has been relegated to a different level, outside American literature, yet it is an integral part,\" she says.<ref>\"[http://www.jmu.edu/monty/FuriousFlower.shtml Coup of the Century]\", James Madison University (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref>  She bases her theory in the experience of Black people in the United States.  Even though African Americans have long claimed an American identity, during most of United States history they were not accepted as full citizens and were actively discriminated against. As a result, they were part of America while also outside it.\n\nSimilarly, African-American literature is within the framework of a larger American literature, but it also is independent. As a result, new styles of storytelling and unique voices have been created in relative isolation. The benefit of this is that these new styles and voices can leave their isolation and help revitalize the larger literary world (McKay, 2004). This artistic pattern has held true with many aspects of [[African-American culture]] over the last century, with [[jazz]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] being just two artistic examples that developed in isolation within the Black community before reaching a larger audience and eventually revitalizing American culture.\n\nSince African-American literature is already popular with mainstream audiences, its ability to develop new styles and voices\u2014or to remain \"authentic,\" in the words of some critics\u2014may be a thing of the past.{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}<ref name = \"Cashmore_Anthology\"/>\n\n===Balkanization of American literature===\n\nSome [[Conservatism|conservative]] academics and intellectuals argue that African-American literature exists as a separate topic only because of the [[balkanization]] of literature over the last few decades, or as an extension of the [[culture wars]] into the field of literature.<ref name=\"Brodhead\">Richard H.

These critics reject bringing identity politics into literature because this would mean that \"only women could write about women for women, and only Blacks about Blacks for Blacks.\"<ref name=\"Brodhead\"/>\n\nPeople opposed to this group-based approach to writing say that it limits the ability of literature to explore the overall human condition. Critics also disagree with classifying writers on the basis of their race, as they believe this is limiting and artists can tackle any subject.\n\nProponents counter that the exploration of group and ethnic dynamics through writing deepens human understanding and previously, entire groups of people were ignored or neglected by American literature.<ref>Theodore O.

Instead, American literature is simply reflecting the increasing diversity of the United States and showing more signs of diversity than before in its history (Andrews, 1997; McKay, 2004).\n\n===African-American criticism===\nSome of the criticism of African-American literature over the years has come from within the community; some argue that black literature sometimes does not portray black people in a positive light and that it should.\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois wrote in the [[NAACP]]'s magazine ''[[The Crisis]]'' on this topic, saying in 1921: \"We want everything that is said about us to tell of the best and highest and noblest in us. We insist that our Art and Propaganda be one.\" He added in 1926, \"All Art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists.\"<ref name = \"jhu_theory\"/> Du Bois and the editors of ''The Crisis'' consistently stated that literature was a tool in the struggle for African-American political liberation.\n\nDu Bois's belief in the propaganda value of art showed when he clashed in 1928 with the author [[Claude McKay]] over his best-selling novel ''Home to Harlem''. Du Bois thought the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem appealed only to the \"prurient demand[s]\" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of Black \"licentiousness.\" Du Bois said, \"'Home to Harlem' ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.\"<ref>John Lowney, \"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397 Haiti and Black Transnationalism: Remapping the Migrant Geography of Home to Harlem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716122158/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397/ |date=July 16, 2012 }},\" ''African American Review'', Fall 2000 (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref> Others made similar criticism of [[Wallace Thurman]]'s novel ''The Blacker the Berry'' in 1929.

In order to substantiate this claim, he cites both the societal pressures to create a distinctly black American literature for uplift and the lack of a well formulated essential notion of literary blackness. For this scholar, the late 19th and early 20th centuries [[de jure]] [[racism]] crystallized the canon of African-American literature as black writers conscripted literature as a means to counter notions of inferiority.  During this period, \u201cwhether African American writers acquiesced in or kicked against the label, they knew what was at stake in accepting or contesting their identification as Negro writers.\u201d<ref>Warren (2011), [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066298 ''What Was African American Literature?''], p. 8.</ref> He writes that \u201c[a]bsent white suspicion of, or commitment to imposing, black inferiority, African American literature would not have existed as a literature\u201d<ref>Warren (2011), [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066298 ''What Was African American Literature?''], p. 15.</ref> Warren bases part of his argument on the distinction between \"the mere existence of literary texts\" and the formation of texts into a coherent body of literature.<ref name=\"WarrenWhat\" /> For Warren, it is the coherence of responding to racist narratives in the struggle for civil rights that establishes the body of African-American literature, and the scholar suggests that continuing to refer to the texts produced after the civil rights era as such is a symptom of nostalgia or a belief that the struggle for civil rights has not yet ended.<ref name=\"WarrenWhat\" />\n\nIn an alternative reading, [[Karla F.

''Legal Fictions'' argues that the social imagination of race is expressly constituted in law and is expressively represented through the imaginative composition of literary fictions. As long as US law specifies a black body as \"[[discrete and insular]],\" it confers a cognizable legal status onto that body. US fictions use that legal identity to construct narratives \u2014 from neo-slave narratives to contemporary novels such as [[Walter Mosley]]'s ''The Man in My Basement'' \u2013 that take constitutional fictions of race and their frames (contracts, property, and evidence) to compose the narratives that cohere the tradition.\n\n== African-American female literature ==\n<!-- This section needs more editing for style-->\n'''African-American female''' [[literature]] is an educational tool used in America by women of African descent.

It begins with the works of such late 18th-century writers as [[Phillis Wheatley]]. Before the high point of slave narratives, African-American literature was dominated by autobiographical spiritual narratives. The genre known as [[slave narratives]] in the 19th century were accounts by people who had generally escaped from slavery, about their journeys to freedom and ways they claimed their lives. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] of the 1920s was a great  period of flowering in literature and the arts, influenced both by writers who came North in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and those who were immigrants from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.  African-American writers have been recognized by the highest awards, including the [[Nobel Prize]] given to [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993. Among the themes and issues explored in this literature are the role of African Americans within the larger American society, African-American culture, [[racism]], [[slavery]], and [[social equality]]. African-American writing has tended to incorporate oral forms, such as [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[sermon]]s, [[gospel music]], [[blues]], or [[rapping|rap]].<ref>Jerry W. Ward, Jr., \"To Shatter Innocence: Teaching African American Poetry\", in ''Teaching African American Literature'', ed. M. Graham, Routledge, 1998, p. 146, {{ISBN|041591695X}}.</ref>\n\nAs African Americans' place in American society has changed over the centuries, so has the focus of African-American literature. Before the [[American Civil War]], the literature primarily consisted of memoirs by people who had escaped from slavery; the genre of [[slave narrative]]s included accounts of life under slavery and the path of justice and redemption to freedom. There was an early distinction between the literature of [[Freedman|freed slaves]] and the literature of [[Free negro|free blacks]] born in the North. Free blacks expressed their oppression in a different narrative form. Free blacks in the North often spoke out against slavery and racial injustices by using the spiritual narrative. The spiritual addressed many of the same themes of slave narratives, but has been largely ignored in current scholarly conversation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830\u20131880)|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8135-2514-3|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, non-fiction works by authors such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Booker T. Washington]] debated how to confront racism in the United States. During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], authors such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] wrote about issues of [[racial segregation]] and [[black nationalism]]. Today, African-American literature has become accepted as an integral part of [[American literature]], with books such as ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]], ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982) by [[Alice Walker]], which won the [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by Toni Morrison achieving both best-selling and award-winning status.\n\nIn broad terms, African-American literature can be defined as writings by people of African descent living in the United States. It is highly varied.<ref>Darryl Dickson-Carr, ''The Columbia Guide to Contemporary African American Fiction'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 10-11, {{ISBN|0-231-12472-4}}.</ref> African-American literature has generally focused on the role of African Americans within the larger American society and what it means to be an American.<ref name = \"Coon_p32\">Katherine Driscoll Coon, \"A Rip in the Tent: Teaching African American Literature\", in ''Teaching African American Literature'', ed.

African-American literature presents experience from an African-American point of view.  In the early Republic, African-American literature represented a way for free blacks to negotiate their identity in an individualized republic. They often tried to exercise their political and social autonomy in the face of resistance from the white public.<ref>{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=Michael|title=Beyond Douglass: New Perspectives on Early African-American Literature|year=2008|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg|isbn=9780838757116|page=69}}</ref> Thus, an early theme of African-American literature was, like other American writings, what it meant to be a citizen in post-Revolutionary America.\n\n== Characteristics and themes ==\n\nAfrican-American literature has both been influenced by the great [[African diaspora|African diasporic]] heritage<ref>Dickson-Carr,''The Columbia Guide'', p. 73.</ref> and shaped it in many countries. It has been created within the larger realm of [[post-colonial literature]], although scholars distinguish between the two, saying that \"African American literature differs from most post-colonial literature in that it is written by members of a minority community who reside within a nation of vast wealth and economic power.\"<ref>Radhika Mohanram and Gita Rajan, ''English Postcoloniality: Literatures from Around the World'', Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1996, p. 135, {{ISBN|0313288542}}.</ref>\n\nAfrican-American oral culture is rich in poetry, including [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[gospel music]], [[blues]], and [[rapping|rap]]. This oral poetry also appears in the African-American tradition of Christian [[sermon]]s, which make use of deliberate repetition, cadence, and alliteration. African-American literature\u2014especially written poetry, but also prose\u2014has a strong tradition of incorporating all of these forms of oral poetry.<ref>Ward, Jr., \"To Shatter Innocence\", p. 146.</ref>  These characteristics do not occur in all works by African-American writers.\n\nSome scholars resist using Western literary theory to analyze African-American literature. As the [[Harvard]] literary scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] said, \"My desire has been to allow the black tradition to speak for itself about its nature and various functions, rather than to read it, or analyze it, in terms of literary theories borrowed whole from other traditions, appropriated from without.\"<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African American Literary Criticism'', New York: Oxford, 1988, p. xix, {{ISBN|0195034635}}.</ref> One trope common to African-American literature is \"[[Signifyin'|signifying]]\".

Terry wrote the ballad in 1746 after an Indian attack on [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. She was enslaved in Deerfield at the time of the attack, when many residents were killed and more than 100, mostly women and children, were taken on a forced march overland to Montreal. Some were later ransomed and redeemed by their families or community; others were adopted by Mohawk families, and some girls joined a French religious order. The ballad was first published in 1854, with an additional couplet, in ''The Springfield Republican''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adams|last2= Pleck|first1=Catherine|first2=Elizabeth|title=Love of Freedom: Black Women in Colonial and Revolutionary New England|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-538909-8|page=Kindle Location 1289}}</ref> and in 1855 in Josiah Holland\u2019s ''History of Western Massachusetts''.\n\nThe poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] (c.1753\u201384) published her book ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]]'' in 1773, three years before [[American independence]]. Wheatley was not only the first African American to publish a book, but the first to achieve an international reputation as a writer. Born in [[Senegal]], Wheatley was captured and sold into slavery at the age of seven. Brought to Massachusetts, she was owned by a [[Boston]] merchant. By the time she was 16, she had mastered her new language of English. Her poetry was praised by many of the leading figures of the [[American Revolution]], including [[George Washington]], who thanked her for a poem written in his honor. Some whites found it hard to believe that a Black woman could write such refined poetry. Wheatley had to defend herself in court to prove that she had written her own work. Some critics cite Wheatley's successful defense as the first recognition of African-American literature.{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}<ref name=\"Cashmore_Anthology\">{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}Ellis Cashmore, review of [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_n4331_v126/ai_19997743 ''The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517072635/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_n4331_v126/ai_19997743 |date=May 17, 2008 }}'', Nellie Y.

In 1778 he wrote an [[ode]] to Phillis Wheatley, in which he discussed their shared humanity and common bonds.\n\nIn 1786, Hammon gave his \"[[Address to the Negroes of the State of New York]]\". Writing at the age of 76 after a lifetime of slavery, Hammon said: \"If we should ever get to Heaven, we shall find nobody to reproach us for being black, or for being slaves.\" He also promoted the idea of gradual [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] as a way to end slavery.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/readex/20400.html An address to the Negroes in the state of New-York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128185140/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/readex/20400.html |date=November 28, 2009 }}, by Jupiter Hammon, servant of John Lloyd, Jun, Esq; of the manor of Queen's Village, Long-Island. 1778.</ref> Hammon is thought to have been a slave on [[Long Island]] until his death.

S\u00e9jour was born free in [[New Orleans]] (he was a [[free person of color]]) and moved to France at the age of 19. There he published his [[short story]] \"''[[Le Mul\u00e2tre]]''\" (\"The Mulatto\") in 1837. It is the first known fiction by an African American, but as it was written in French and published in a French journal, it had apparently no influence on later American literature.

Born into slavery in Kentucky, Brown was working on riverboats based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], when he escaped to Ohio. He began to work for abolitionist causes, making his way to [[Buffalo, New York]] and later [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He was a prolific writer, beginning with an account of his escape to freedom and experience under slavery. Brown wrote ''[[Clotel|Clotel; or, The President's Daughter]]'' (1853), considered to be the first novel written by an African American. It was based on the persistent rumor that president [[Thomas Jefferson]] had fathered a mixed-race daughter with his slave [[Sally Hemings]]. (In the late 20th century, DNA testing affirmed for most historians that Jefferson was the father of six children with Hemings; four survived to adulthood and he gave all their freedom.) The novel was first published in England, where Brown was living for several years.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/brown/summary.html \"William Wells Brown, 1814?-1884: Clotel; or, The President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave Life in the United States.

They wanted to describe the cruelties of life under slavery, as well as the persistent humanity of the slaves as persons. At the time, the controversy over [[slavery]] led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue, with novels such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe's representing the abolitionist view of the evils of slavery. Southern white writers produced the \"[[Anti-Tom]]\" novels in response, purporting to truly describe life under slavery, as well as the more severe cruelties suffered by free labor in the North. Examples include ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Mary Henderson Eastman]] and ''The Sword and the Distaff'' (1853) by [[William Gilmore Simms]].\n\nThe slave narratives were integral to African-American literature. Some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the [[Caribbean]] wrote accounts of their lives, with about 150 of these published as separate books or pamphlets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Slave narratives can be broadly categorized into three distinct forms: tales of religious redemption, tales to inspire the abolitionist struggle, and tales of progress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The tales written to inspire the abolitionist struggle are the most famous because they tend to have a strong autobiographical motif. Many of them are now recognized as the most literary of all 19th-century writings by African Americans, with two of the best-known being [[Frederick Douglass]]'s autobiography and ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' by [[Harriet Jacobs]] (1861).\n\nJacobs (1813\u20131897) was born a slave in Edenton, North Carolina and was the first woman to author a slave narrative in the United States. Although her narrative ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was written under the pseudonym \"Linda Brent\", the autobiography can be traced through a series of letters from Jacobs to various friends and advisors, most importantly to [[Lydia Maria Child]], the eventual editor of incidents. The narrative details Jacobs' struggle for freedom, not only for herself but for her two children. Jacobs' narrative occupies an important place in the history of African-American literature as it discloses through her firsthand example the specific injustices that black women suffered under slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe was asked to write a foreword for Jacob's book, but refused.\n\n=== Frederick Douglass ===\n{{Main|Frederick Douglass}}\n[[File:Frederick Douglass (circa 1879).jpg|thumb|160px|Frederick Douglass]]\nFrederick Douglass (c. 1818\u20131895) first came to public attention in the North as an orator for abolition and as the author of a moving slave narrative. He eventually became the most prominent African American of his time and one of the most influential lecturers and authors in American history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/slave-route/resistances-and-abolitions/frederick-douglass/|title=The Slave Route: Who was Frederick Douglass?|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBorn into slavery in Maryland, Douglass eventually escaped and worked for numerous abolitionist causes. He also edited a number of newspapers. Douglass' best-known work is his autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which was published in 1845. At the time some critics attacked the book, not believing that a black man could have written such an eloquent work. Despite this, the book was an immediate bestseller.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/22/narrative-life-frederick-douglass-american-slave-review|title=The 100 best nonfiction books: No 68 \u2013 Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave by Frederick Douglass (1845)|last=McCrum|first=Robert|date=May 22, 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref> Douglass later revised and expanded his autobiography, which was republished as ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). In addition to serving in a number of political posts during his life, he also wrote numerous influential articles and essays.\n\n===Spiritual narratives===\n\nEarly African-American spiritual autobiographies were published in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Authors of such narratives include [[Ukawsaw Gronniosaw|James Gronniosaw]], [[John Marrant]], and George White. William L. Andrews argues that these early narratives \"gave the twin themes of the Afro-American 'pregeneric myth'\u2014knowledge and freedom\u2014their earliest narrative form\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=William|title=Sisters of the Spirit: Three Black Women's Autobiographies of the Nineteenth Century|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253352606|page=[https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/1 1]|url=https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/1}}</ref> These spiritual narratives were important predecessors of the slave narratives which proliferated the literary scene of the 19th century. These spiritual narratives have often been left out of the study of African-American literature because some scholars have deemed them historical or sociological documents, despite their importance to understanding African-American literature as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=5}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American women who wrote spiritual narratives had to negotiate the precarious positions of being black and women in early America. Women claimed their authority to preach and write spiritual narratives by citing the [[Epistle of James]], often calling themselves \"doers of the word\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=3}}</ref> The study of these women and their spiritual narratives are significant to the understanding of African-American life in the Antebellum North because they offer both historical context and literary tropes. Women who wrote these narratives had a clear knowledge of literary genres and biblical narratives. This contributed to advancing their message about African-American women\u2019s agency and countered the dominant racist and sexist discourse of early American society.\n\n[[Zilpha Elaw]] was born in 1790 in America to free parents. She was a preacher for five years in England without the support of a denomination.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=William|title=Sisters of the Spirit: Three Black Women's Autobiographies of the Nineteenth Century|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253352606|page=[https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/2 2]|url=https://archive.org/details/sistersofspiritt0000unse/page/2}}</ref> She published her ''Memoirs of the Life, Religious Experience, Ministerial Travel and Labours of Mrs. Zilpha Elaw, an American Female of Colour'' in 1846, while still living in England. Her narrative was meant to be an account of her spiritual experience. Yet some critics argue that her work was also meant to be a literary contribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Frances Smith|title=Written By Herself: Literary Production by African American Women, 1746-1892|year=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253324092|page=[https://archive.org/details/writtenbyherself0000fost/page/84 84]|url=https://archive.org/details/writtenbyherself0000fost/page/84}}</ref> Elaw aligns herself in a literary tradition of respectable women of her time who were trying to combat the immoral literature of the time.<ref name=Foster85>{{cite book|last=Foster|title=Written By Herself|year=1993|location=|isbn=|page=85}}</ref>\n\n[[Maria W. Stewart]] published a collection of her religious writings with an autobiographical experience attached in 1879. The publication was called ''Meditations from the Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart''. She also had two works published in 1831 and 1832 titled ''Religion and the Pure Principles of Morality'' and ''Meditations''. Maria Stewart was known for her public speeches in which she talked about the role of black women and race relations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=57}}</ref> Her works were praised by [[Alexander Crummell]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. Stewart's works have been argued to be a refashioning of the [[jeremiad]] tradition and focus on the specific plight of African Americans in America during the period.<ref>Peterson, Carla. pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\u2013\n\n[[Jarena Lee]] published two religious autobiographical narratives: ''The Life and Religious Experience of Jarena Lee'' and ''Religious Experience and Journal of Mrs. Jarena Lee''. These two narratives were published in 1836 and 1849 respectively. Both works spoke about Lee's life as a preacher for the African Methodist Church. But her narratives were not endorsed by the Methodists because a woman preaching was contrary to their church doctrine.<ref>Ferguson, Moira, ''Nine Black Women'', p. 148.</ref> Some critics argue that Lee's contribution to African-American literature lies in her disobedience to the patriarchal church system and her assertion of women's rights within the Methodist Church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Carla|title=Doers of the Word|page=74}}</ref>\n\n[[Nancy Prince]] was born in 1799, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], and was of African and Native American descent. She turned to religion at the age of 16 in an attempt to find comfort from the trials of her life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Moira|title=Nine Black Women|page=172}}</ref> She married Nero Prince and traveled extensively in the West Indies and Russia. She became a missionary and in 1841 she tried to raise funds for missionary work in the West Indies, publishing a pamphlet entitled ''The West Indies: Being a Description of the Islands, Progress of Christianity, Education, and Liberty Among the Colored Population Generally''. Later, in 1850, she published ''A Narrative of the Life and Travels of Mrs. Nancy Prince''. These publications were both spiritual narratives and travel narratives.<ref name=Foster85 /> Similar to Jarena Lee, Prince adhered to the standards of Christian religion by framing her unique travel narrative in a Christian perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|year=1993|title=Written by Herself|page=86}}</ref> Yet, her narrative poses a counter narrative to the 19th century's ideal of a demure woman who had no voice in society and little knowledge of the world.\n\n[[Sojourner Truth]] (1797\u20131883) was a leading advocate in both the abolitionist and feminist movements in the 19th century. Born Isabella to a wealthy Dutch master in [[Ulster County, New York]], she adopted the name Sojourner Truth after 40 years of struggle, first to attain her freedom and then to work on the mission she felt God intended for her. This new name was to \"signify the new person she had become in the spirit, a traveler dedicated to speaking the Truth as God revealed it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=245}}</ref> Truth played a significant role during the Civil War. She worked tirelessly on several civil rights fronts; she recruited black troops in Michigan, helped with relief efforts for freedmen and women escaping from the South, led a successful effort to desegregate the streetcars in Washington, D.C., and she counseled President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Truth never learned to read or write but in 1850, she worked with Olive Gilbert, a sympathetic white woman, to write the ''Narrative of Sojourner Truth''. This narrative was a contribution to both the slave narrative and female spiritual narratives.\n\n=== Post-slavery era ===\n\nAfter the end of slavery and the American Civil War, a number of African-American authors wrote nonfiction works about the condition of African Americans in the United States. Many African-American women wrote about the principles of behavior of life during the period.<ref>{{cite book | title=Her Prologue: The Novels of Black American Women | publisher=Greenwood | author=Watson, Carole M. | year=1985| author-link=Carole M. Watson }}</ref> [[African-American newspapers]] were a popular venue for essays, poetry and fiction as well as journalism, with newspaper writers like [[Jennie Carter]](1830\u20131881) developing a large following.<ref>Eric Gardner, ''Jennie Carter: A Black Journalist of the Early West'',  University Press of Mississippi, January 1, 2007.</ref>\n\nAmong the most prominent of post-slavery writers is [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] (1868\u20131963), who had a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard University, and was one of the original founders of the [[NAACP]] in 1910. At the turn of the century, Du Bois published a highly influential collection of essays entitled ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]''. The essays on race were groundbreaking and drew from Du Bois's personal experiences to describe how African Americans lived in rural Georgia and in the larger American society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Du Bois wrote: \"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line\",<ref>Du Bois, W.E.B. ''The Souls of Black Folk,'' Penguin Books, 1996, p. 10, {{ISBN|014018998X}}.</ref> a statement since considered prescient. Du Bois believed that African Americans should, because of their common interests, work together to battle prejudice and inequity. He was a professor at [[Atlanta University]] and later at [[Howard University]].\n\nAnother prominent author of this period is [[Booker T. Washington]] (1856\u20131915), who in many ways represented opposite views from Du Bois. Washington was an educator and the founder of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], a [[historically black college]] in Alabama. Among his published works are ''[[Up From Slavery]]'' (1901), ''The Future of the American Negro'' (1899), ''Tuskegee and Its People'' (1905), and ''My Larger Education'' (1911). In contrast to Du Bois, who adopted a more confrontational attitude toward ending racial strife in America, Washington believed that Blacks should first lift themselves up and prove themselves the equal of whites before asking for an end to racism. While this viewpoint was popular among some Blacks (and many whites) at the time, Washington's political views would later fall out of fashion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n[[Elizabeth Keckley]] (1818\u20131907) was a former slave who managed to establish a successful career as a dressmaker who catered to the Washington political elite after obtaining her freedom. However, soon after publishing ''Behind the Scenes; or, Thirty Years as a Slave and Four Years in the White House'', she lost her job and found herself reduced to doing odd jobs. Although she acknowledged the cruelties of her enslavement and her resentment towards it, Keckley chose to focus her narrative on the incidents that \"moulded her character\", and on how she proved herself \"worth her salt\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=365}}</ref> ''Behind the Scenes'' details Keckley's life in slavery, her work for [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] and her efforts to obtain her freedom. Keckley was also deeply committed to programs of racial improvement and protection and helped found the Home for Destitute Women and Children in Washington, D.C., as a result. In addition to this, Keckley taught at Wilberforce University in Ohio.\n\n[[Josephine Brown]] (born 1839), the youngest child of abolitionist and author [[William Wells Brown]], wrote a biography of her father, ''Biography of an American Bondman, By His Daughter''. Brown wrote the first ten chapters of the narrative while studying in France, as a means of satisfying her classmates' curiosity about her father. After returning to America, she discovered that the narrative of her father\u2019s life, written by him, and published a few years before, was out of print and thus produced the rest of the chapters that constitute ''Biography of an American Bondman''. Brown was a qualified teacher but she was also extremely active as an advocate against slavery.\n\nAlthough not a US citizen, the [[Jamaica]]n [[Marcus Garvey]] (1887\u20131940), was a newspaper publisher, journalist, and activist for [[Pan Africanism]] who became well known in the United States. He founded the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] (UNIA). He encouraged black nationalism and for people of African ancestry to look favorably upon their ancestral homeland. He wrote a number of essays published as editorials in the UNIA house organ, the ''[[Negro World]]'' newspaper. Some of his lecture material and other writings were compiled and published as nonfiction books by his second wife [[Amy Jacques Garvey]] as the ''Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey Or, Africa for the Africans'' (1924) and ''More Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey'' (1977).\n\n[[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], who often wrote in the rural, [[African American Vernacular English|black dialect]] of the day, was the first African-American poet to gain national prominence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/paul-laurence-dunbar|title=Paul Laurence Dunbar|last=Dunbar|first=Paul Laurence|date=2000-07-14|website=Paul Laurence Dunbar|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref> His first book of poetry, ''Oak and Ivy'', was published in 1893. Much of Dunbar's work, such as ''When Malindy Sings'' (1906), which includes photographs taken by the [[Hampton Institute]] Camera Club, and ''Joggin' Erlong'' (1906) provide revealing glimpses into the lives of rural African Americans of the day. Though Dunbar died young, he was a prolific poet, essayist, novelist (among them ''The Uncalled'', 1898 and ''The Fanatics'', 1901) and short story writer.\n\nOther African-American writers also rose to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among these is [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], a well-known short story writer and essayist. [[Mary Weston Fordham]] published ''Magnolia Leaves'' in 1897, a book of poetry on religious, spiritual, and occasionally feminist themes with an introduction by [[Booker T. Washington]].\n\n[[Frances E. W. Harper]] (1825\u20131911) wrote four novels, several volumes of poetry, and numerous stories, poems, essays and letters. Born to free parents in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper received an uncommonly thorough education at her uncle, William Watkins' school. In 1853, publication of Harper\u2019s ''Eliza Harris'', which was one of many responses to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin]]'', brought her national attention. Harper was hired by the Maine Anti-Slavery Society and in the first six weeks, she managed to travel to twenty cities, giving at least thirty-one lectures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|year=1997|location=|isbn=|page=491}}</ref>  Her book ''Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects'', a collection of poems and essays prefaced by [[William Lloyd Garrison]], was published in 1854 and sold more than 10,000 copies within three years. Harper was often characterized as \"a noble Christian woman\" and \"one of the most scholarly and well-read women of her day\", but she was also known as a strong advocate against slavery and the post-Civil War repressive measures against blacks.\n\n=== Harlem Renaissance ===\n{{Main|Harlem Renaissance}}\nThe [[Harlem Renaissance]] from 1920 to 1940 was a flowering of African-American literature and art. Based in the African-American community of [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] in [[New York City]], it was part of a larger flowering of social thought and culture. Numerous Black artists, musicians and others produced classic works in fields from jazz to theater; the renaissance is perhaps best known for the literature that came out of it.\n\n[[Image:LangstonHughes.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Langston Hughes, photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1936]]\n\nAmong the most renowned writers of the renaissance is poet [[Langston Hughes]], whose first work was published in ''[[The Brownies' Book]]'' in 1921.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://childlit.unl.edu/topics/edi.brownies.html|encyclopedia=The Tar Baby and the Tomahawk:Race and Ethnic Images in American Children's Literature, 1880-1939|title=The Brownies' Book|others=Center for Digital Research in the Humanities ([[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]]) and Center for the Humanities ([[Washington University in St. Louis]])|publisher=Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln}}</ref> He first received attention in the 1922 publication ''The Book of American Negro Poetry''. Edited by [[James Weldon Johnson]], this anthology featured the work of the period's most talented poets, including [[Claude McKay]], who also published three novels, ''Home to Harlem'', ''Banjo'' and ''Banana Bottom,'' a nonfiction book, \"Harlem: Negro Metropolis\" and a collection of short stories. In 1926, Hughes published a collection of poetry, ''The Weary Blues'', and in 1930 a novel, ''Not Without Laughter''. Perhaps his most famous poem is \"[[The Negro Speaks of Rivers]]\", which he wrote as a young teen. His single, most recognized character is Jesse B. Simple, a plainspoken, pragmatic [[Harlem]]ite whose comedic observations appeared in Hughes's columns for the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]''. ''Simple Speaks His Mind'' (1950) is perhaps the best-known collection of Simple stories published in book form. Until his death in 1967, Hughes published nine volumes of poetry, eight books of short stories, two novels and a number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[children's books]] and translations.\n\nAnother notable writer of the renaissance is novelist [[Zora Neale Hurston]], author of the classic novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (1937). Although Hurston wrote 14 books that ranged from [[anthropology]] to [[short stories]] to novel-length fiction, her writings fell into obscurity for decades. Her work was rediscovered in the 1970s through a 1975 article by [[Alice Walker]], \"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\", published in ''Ms. magazine''. Walker found in Hurston a role model for all female African-American writers.\n\nWhile Hurston and Hughes are the two most influential writers to come out of the Harlem Renaissance, a number of other writers also became well known during this period. They include [[Jean Toomer]], author of ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'', a famous collection of stories, poems, and sketches about rural and urban Black life, and [[Dorothy West]], whose novel ''The Living is Easy'' examined the life of an [[upper-class]] Black family. Another popular renaissance writer is [[Countee Cullen]], who in his poems described everyday black life (such as a trip he made to Baltimore that was ruined by a racial insult). Cullen's books include the poetry collections ''Color'' (1925), ''Copper Sun'' (1927), and ''The Ballad of the Brown Girl'' (1927). [[Frank Marshall Davis]]'s poetry collections ''Black Man's Verse'' (1935) and ''I am the American Negro'' (1937), published by [[Black Cat Press]], earned him critical acclaim. Author [[Wallace Thurman]] also made an impact with his novel ''[[The Blacker the Berry (novel)|The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life]]'' (1929), which focused on intraracial prejudice between lighter-skinned and darker-skinned African Americans.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance marked a turning point for African-American literature. Prior to this time, books by African Americans were primarily read by other Black people. With the renaissance, though, African-American literature\u2014as well as black fine art and performance art\u2014began to be absorbed into mainstream American culture.\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement era ===\n\nA large migration of African Americans began during [[World War I]], hitting its high point during [[World War II]]. During this [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], Black people left the racism and lack of opportunities in the American South and settled in northern cities such as [[Chicago]], where they found work in factories and other sectors of the economy.<ref>David M.

The migration also empowered the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]], which made a powerful impression on Black writers during the 1940s, '50s and '60s. Just as Black activists were pushing to end segregation and racism and create a new sense of Black nationalism, so too were Black authors attempting to address these issues with their writings.\n\nOne of the first writers to do so was [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], whose work addressed issues of race and [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Baldwin, who is best known for his novel ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)|Go Tell It on the Mountain]]'', wrote deeply personal stories and essays while examining what it was like to be both Black and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] at a time when neither of these identities was accepted by American culture. In all, Baldwin wrote nearly 20 books, including such classics as ''[[Another Country (novel)|Another Country]]'' and ''[[The Fire Next Time]]''.\n\nBaldwin's idol and friend was author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], whom Baldwin called \"the greatest Black writer in the world for me\". Wright is best known for his novel ''[[Native Son]]'' (1940), which tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a Black man struggling for acceptance in Chicago. Baldwin was so impressed by the novel that he titled a collection of his own essays ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'', in reference to Wright's novel. However, their friendship fell apart due to one of the book's essays, \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" which criticized ''Native Son'' for lacking credible characters and psychological complexity. Among Wright's other books are the autobiographical novel ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945), ''[[The Outsider (Wright novel)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), and ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957).\n\nThe other great novelist of this period is [[Ralph Ellison]], best known for his novel ''[[Invisible Man (novel)|Invisible Man]]'' (1952), which won the [[National Book Award]] in 1953. Even though he did not complete another novel during his lifetime, ''Invisible Man'' was so influential that it secured his place in literary history. After Ellison's death in 1994, a second novel, ''[[Juneteenth (novel)|Juneteenth]]'' (1999), was pieced together from the 2,000-plus pages he had written over 40 years. A fuller version of the manuscript was published as ''[[Three Days Before the Shooting]]'' (2010).\n<!-- Jones, Edward, ''The Known World'', 2003\nCarter Stephen, ''New England White'' 2007\nWright W.D. ''Crisis of the Black Intellectual'', 2007-->\n\n[[Image:Ralph Ellison photo portrait seated.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Ralph Ellison circa 1961]]\n\nThe Civil Rights time period also saw the rise of female Black poets, most notably [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], who became the first African American to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] when it was awarded for her 1949 book of poetry, ''[[Annie Allen]]''. Along with Brooks, other female poets who became well known during the 1950s and '60s are [[Nikki Giovanni]] and [[Sonia Sanchez]].\n\nDuring this time, a number of playwrights also came to national attention, notably [[Lorraine Hansberry]], whose play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' focuses on a poor Black family living in Chicago. The play won the 1959 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. Another playwright who gained attention was [[Amiri Baraka]], who wrote controversial off-Broadway plays. In more recent years, Baraka became known for his poetry and music criticism.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of important essays and books about human rights were written by the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. One of the leading examples of these is [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]'s \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\".\n\n===Recent history===\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, African-American literature reached the mainstream as books by Black writers continually achieved best-selling and award-winning status. This was also the time when the work of African-American writers began to be accepted by academia as a legitimate genre of American literature.<ref>Ronald Roach, \"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_n15_v14/ai_20318388 Powerful pages\u2014unprecedented public impact of W.W.

A number of scholars and writers are generally credited with helping to promote and define African-American literature as a genre during this time period, including fiction writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and poet [[James Emanuel]].\n\nJames Emanuel took a major step toward defining African-American literature when he edited (with Theodore Gross) ''Dark Symphony: Negro Literature in America'' (1968), a collection of black writings released by a major publisher.<ref name=\"James\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003041.pdf James A.

Davis]] and [[Ulysses Lee]] in 1969; and ''We Speak As Liberators: Young Black Poets \u2014 An Anthology'', edited by [[Orde Coombs]] and published in 1970.\n\n[[Toni Morrison]], meanwhile, helped promote Black literature and authors  in the 1960s and '70s when she worked as an editor for [[Random House]], where she edited books by such authors as [[Toni Cade Bambara]] and [[Gayl Jones]]. Morrison herself would later emerge as one of the most important African-American writers of the 20th century. Her first novel, ''The Bluest Eye'', was published in 1970. Among her most famous novels is ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1988. This story describes a slave who found freedom but killed her infant daughter to save her from a life of slavery. Another important Morrison novel is ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', a tale about [[materialism]], [[unrequited love]], and brotherhood. Morrison is the first African American to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nIn the 1970s novelist and poet [[Alice Walker]] wrote a famous essay that brought [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and her classic novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' back to the attention of the literary world. In 1982, Walker won both the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the [[American Book Award]] for her novel ''[[The Color Purple]]''. An [[epistolary novel]] (a book written in the form of letters), ''The Color Purple'' tells the story of Celie, a young woman who is sexually abused by her stepfather and then is forced to marry a man who physically [[spousal abuse|abuses]] her.  The novel was later made into a film by [[Steven Spielberg]].\n\nThe 1970s also saw African-American books topping the bestseller lists. Among the first to do so was ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]]. A fictionalized account of Haley's family history\u2014beginning with the kidnapping of his ancestor [[Kunta Kinte]] in [[The Gambia|Gambia]] through his life as a slave in the United States\u2014''Roots'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and became a popular television [[miniseries]]. Haley also wrote ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'' in 1965.\n\nOther important writers in recent years include [[literary fiction]] writers Gayl Jones, [[Rasheed Clark]], [[Ishmael Reed]], [[Jamaica Kincaid]], [[Randall Kenan]], and [[John Edgar Wideman]]. African-American poets have also garnered attention. [[Maya Angelou]] read a poem at [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration, [[Rita Dove]] won a Pulitzer Prize and served as [[Poet Laureate]] of the United States from 1993 to 1995, and [[Cyrus Cassells]]'s ''Soul Make a Path through Shouting'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1994. Cassells is a recipient of the [[William Carlos Williams Award]]. [[Natasha Trethewey]] won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry with her book ''Native Guard''. Lesser-known poets such as [[Thylias Moss]] also have been praised for their innovative work. Notable black playwrights include [[Ntozake Shange]], who wrote ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]'' (1976), [[Ed Bullins]], [[Suzan-Lori Parks]], and the prolific [[August Wilson]], who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his plays. More recently, [[Edward P. Jones]] won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for ''[[The Known World]]'' (2003), his novel about a black slaveholder in the [[Antebellum Era in the United States|antebellum]] South.\n\nYounger African-American novelists include [[David Anthony Durham]], [[Karen E. Quinones Miller]], [[Tayari Jones]], [[Kalisha Buckhanon]], [[Mat Johnson]], [[ZZ Packer]] and [[Colson Whitehead]], to name a few. African-American literature has also crossed over to [[genre fiction]]. A pioneer in this area is [[Chester Himes]], who in the 1950s and '60s wrote a series of [[mass market paperback|pulp fiction]] detective novels featuring \"Coffin\" Ed Johnson and \"Gravedigger\" Jones, two New York City police detectives. Himes paved the way for the later crime novels of [[Walter Mosley]] and [[Hugh Holton]]. African Americans are also represented in the genres of science fiction, fantasy and horror, with [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Octavia E. Butler]], [[Steven Barnes]], [[Tananarive Due]], [[Robert Fleming (author)|Robert Fleming]], [[Brandon Massey]], [[Charles R. Saunders]], [[John Ridley]], [[John M. Faucette]], [[Sheree Thomas]] and [[Nalo Hopkinson]] being just a few of the well-known authors.\n\nFinally, African-American literature has gained added attention through the work of talk-show host [[Oprah Winfrey]], who repeatedly has leveraged her fame to promote literature through the medium of her [[Oprah's Book Club]]. At times, she has brought African-American writers a far broader audience than they otherwise might have received.\n\n[[Hip-hop]] literature has become popular recently popular in the African-American community.<ref>Beauty Bragg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40587216?seq=1 Review of ''Writing the Future of Black America: Literature of the Hip-Hop Generation'' by Daniel Grassian], in ''[[MELUS]]'', Vol. 35, No. 1, Transgressing the Borders of \"America\" (Spring 2010), pp. 184\u2013186.</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\n\nWhile African-American literature is well accepted in the United States, there are numerous views on its significance, traditions, and theories. To the genre's supporters, African-American literature arose out of the experience of Blacks in the United States, especially with regards to historic racism and discrimination, and is an attempt to refute the dominant culture's literature and power. In addition, supporters see the literature existing both within and outside [[American literature]] and as helping to revitalize the country's writing. To critics {{Who|date=August 2011}}, African-American literature is part of a [[Balkanization]] of American literature. In addition, there are some within the African-American community who do not like how their own literature sometimes showcases Black people.\n\n=== Refuting the dominant literary culture ===\n\nThroughout American history, African Americans have been discriminated against and subject to racist attitudes.  This experience inspired some Black writers, at least during the early years of African-American literature, to prove they were the equals of European-American authors.  As Henry Louis Gates, Jr, has said, \"it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture.\"<ref name = \"Stryz_p140\">\"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter\" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.</ref>\n\nBy refuting the claims of the dominant culture, African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States.  Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as \"something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity.\"<ref name = \"Stryz_p140\"/>  This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination.  By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke \"the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power.\"<ref>Quote from Marjorie Pryse in \"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter\" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.</ref> In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, perhaps most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name = \"jhu_theory\">Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html \"African-American Theory and Criticism\"] (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref>\n\n===Existing both inside and outside American literature===\n\nAccording to Joanne Gabbin, a professor, African-American literature exists both inside and outside American literature. \"Somehow African American literature has been relegated to a different level, outside American literature, yet it is an integral part,\" she says.<ref>\"[http://www.jmu.edu/monty/FuriousFlower.shtml Coup of the Century]\", James Madison University (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref>  She bases her theory in the experience of Black people in the United States.  Even though African Americans have long claimed an American identity, during most of United States history they were not accepted as full citizens and were actively discriminated against. As a result, they were part of America while also outside it.\n\nSimilarly, African-American literature is within the framework of a larger American literature, but it also is independent. As a result, new styles of storytelling and unique voices have been created in relative isolation. The benefit of this is that these new styles and voices can leave their isolation and help revitalize the larger literary world (McKay, 2004). This artistic pattern has held true with many aspects of [[African-American culture]] over the last century, with [[jazz]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] being just two artistic examples that developed in isolation within the Black community before reaching a larger audience and eventually revitalizing American culture.\n\nSince African-American literature is already popular with mainstream audiences, its ability to develop new styles and voices\u2014or to remain \"authentic,\" in the words of some critics\u2014may be a thing of the past.{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}<ref name = \"Cashmore_Anthology\"/>\n\n===Balkanization of American literature===\n\nSome [[Conservatism|conservative]] academics and intellectuals argue that African-American literature exists as a separate topic only because of the [[balkanization]] of literature over the last few decades, or as an extension of the [[culture wars]] into the field of literature.<ref name=\"Brodhead\">Richard H. Brodhead, [http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/pubs/A20/brodhead2.html \"On the Debate Over Multiculturalism\"], ''On Common Ground '', no. 7 (Fall 1996), (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} According to these critics, literature is splitting into distinct and separate groupings because of the rise of [[identity politics]] in the United States and other parts of the world. These critics reject bringing identity politics into literature because this would mean that \"only women could write about women for women, and only Blacks about Blacks for Blacks.\"<ref name=\"Brodhead\"/>\n\nPeople opposed to this group-based approach to writing say that it limits the ability of literature to explore the overall human condition. Critics also disagree with classifying writers on the basis of their race, as they believe this is limiting and artists can tackle any subject.\n\nProponents counter that the exploration of group and ethnic dynamics through writing deepens human understanding and previously, entire groups of people were ignored or neglected by American literature.<ref>Theodore O.

Instead, American literature is simply reflecting the increasing diversity of the United States and showing more signs of diversity than before in its history (Andrews, 1997; McKay, 2004).\n\n===African-American criticism===\nSome of the criticism of African-American literature over the years has come from within the community; some argue that black literature sometimes does not portray black people in a positive light and that it should.\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois wrote in the [[NAACP]]'s magazine ''[[The Crisis]]'' on this topic, saying in 1921: \"We want everything that is said about us to tell of the best and highest and noblest in us. We insist that our Art and Propaganda be one.\" He added in 1926, \"All Art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists.\"<ref name = \"jhu_theory\"/> Du Bois and the editors of ''The Crisis'' consistently stated that literature was a tool in the struggle for African-American political liberation.\n\nDu Bois's belief in the propaganda value of art showed when he clashed in 1928 with the author [[Claude McKay]] over his best-selling novel ''Home to Harlem''. Du Bois thought the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem appealed only to the \"prurient demand[s]\" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of Black \"licentiousness.\" Du Bois said, \"'Home to Harlem' ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.\"<ref>John Lowney, \"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397 Haiti and Black Transnationalism: Remapping the Migrant Geography of Home to Harlem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716122158/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397/ |date=July 16, 2012 }},\" ''African American Review'', Fall 2000 (accessed July 6, 2005).</ref> Others made similar criticism of [[Wallace Thurman]]'s novel ''The Blacker the Berry'' in 1929.

[[Langston Hughes]] articulated this view in his essay \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\" (1926).  He wrote that Black artists intended to express themselves freely no matter what the Black public or white public thought.\n\nMore recently, some critics accused [[Alice Walker]] of unfairly attacking black men in her novel ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982).<ref>Michael E.

[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066298 ''What Was African American Literature?''] Harvard University Press, 2011.</ref> argues that black American writing, as a literature, began with the institution of [[Jim Crow]] legislation and ended with [[desegregation]]. In order to substantiate this claim, he cites both the societal pressures to create a distinctly black American literature for uplift and the lack of a well formulated essential notion of literary blackness. For this scholar, the late 19th and early 20th centuries [[de jure]] [[racism]] crystallized the canon of African-American literature as black writers conscripted literature as a means to counter notions of inferiority.  During this period, \u201cwhether African American writers acquiesced in or kicked against the label, they knew what was at stake in accepting or contesting their identification as Negro writers.\u201d<ref>Warren (2011), [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066298 ''What Was African American Literature?''], p. 8.</ref> He writes that \u201c[a]bsent white suspicion of, or commitment to imposing, black inferiority, African American literature would not have existed as a literature\u201d<ref>Warren (2011), [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066298 ''What Was African American Literature?''], p. 15.</ref> Warren bases part of his argument on the distinction between \"the mere existence of literary texts\" and the formation of texts into a coherent body of literature.<ref name=\"WarrenWhat\" /> For Warren, it is the coherence of responding to racist narratives in the struggle for civil rights that establishes the body of African-American literature, and the scholar suggests that continuing to refer to the texts produced after the civil rights era as such is a symptom of nostalgia or a belief that the struggle for civil rights has not yet ended.<ref name=\"WarrenWhat\" />\n\nIn an alternative reading, [[Karla F.

''Legal Fictions'' argues that the social imagination of race is expressly constituted in law and is expressively represented through the imaginative composition of literary fictions. As long as US law specifies a black body as \"[[discrete and insular]],\" it confers a cognizable legal status onto that body. US fictions use that legal identity to construct narratives \u2014 from neo-slave narratives to contemporary novels such as [[Walter Mosley]]'s ''The Man in My Basement'' \u2013 that take constitutional fictions of race and their frames (contracts, property, and evidence) to compose the narratives that cohere the tradition.\n\n== African-American female literature ==\n<!-- This section needs more editing for style-->\n'''African-American female''' [[literature]] is an educational tool used in America by women of African descent.

He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Liutbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much larger host of West Francia with a significantly smaller army. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of dead spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and partitioned named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria. Louis received it a year later when Carloman expired.\n\nIn November 878 after the death of Charles the Bald, his heir, [[Louis the Stammerer]], and the latter's cousin Louis the Younger promised each other to respect the succession of their respective sons and to issue no claims contrary to that, at [[Voeren]] (''Fourons'' in [[French language|French]]). This Treaty of Fouron was soon put to the test, when Louis the Stammerer died in April 879. A party of western nobles led by [[Abbot Joscelin]] invited Louis the Younger to succeed to the rule of the western kingdom. Since his wife Luitgard also advocated heeding this call, Louis invaded West Francia. He marched as far as [[Verdun]], but after the new kings [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] and [[Carloman of France|Carloman]] ceded their part of [[Lotharingia]] to the invader, Louis retreated. In February 880, this gain was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], signed near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint Quentin]]. This treaty determined the border of the two kingdoms that were to remain unchanged until the fourteenth century.\n\n===Relationship with the nobility===\nIn contrast to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests with those of the nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the [[Ottonian|Luidovingian]] relatives of his wife, that later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the [[Rhineland]], avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], [[Duke of Carinthia]].<ref>As \"prefect of the marches.\" Bowlus, 569.</ref>\n\n===Viking incursions===\nSince the summer of 879, [[Vikings]] had been increasing their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into the interior of the land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a [[Norsemen|Norse]] host at the [[Battle of Thimeon]] (near modern [[Charleroi]]).{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle.{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} The next year, Louis defeated the [[Norsemen|Norse]] again at the [[Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu|battle of Saucourt]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=235}} Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of [[Nijmegen]], which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by [[Brun, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bruno]], the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near [[Hamburg]] and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell.\n\n==Death and succession==\nLouis fell sick in 881 and died in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 January 882. He was buried beside his father in the abbey of Lorsch. By his wife Luitgard of Saxony, he had had a son called Louis (877&ndash;879), who died in a fall from a palace window, and a daughter called Hildegard (878&ndash;895). Louis had also fathered an illegitimate son, Hugh (855/60 \u2013 February 880), either with the daughter of Adalard or with an earlier concubine. Since he left no heir, all his territories fell to his brother Charles, who thus could reunite the entire East Frankish kingdom. Hildegard later joined with the Bavarian magnate [[Engeldeo]] in conspiring against [[Arnulf of Carinthia|King Arnulf]] and was deprived of her \"public honours\" in 895, according to the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.\n\n== Family ==\nLouis the Younger married Liutgard, a daughter of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf of Saxony]], Liudolf of Saxony was grandfather of King [[Henry I of Germany]].\n\n* [[Louis of Saxony|Louis]] (876 - November 879)\n* Hildegard (875/878 or 881 - after ca.900)\n* Bernhart\n\nHis illegitimate children were:\n* [[Hugo (Son of Louis the Younger)|Hugo]] (ca. 855/860 - February 880), illegitimate son{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}}\n* Adalhard, illegitimate son\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Germany family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Charles Oman|Oman, Charles]].
