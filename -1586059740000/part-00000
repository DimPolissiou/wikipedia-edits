O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

{"title_page": "State Basketball League All-Star Five", "text_new": "{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nThe '''State Basketball League All-Star Five''' is an annual [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) honour bestowed on the best players in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL following every season. Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| [[Shelly Boston]] || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.

"{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nThe '''State Basketball League All-Star Five''' is an annual [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) honour bestowed on the best players in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL following every season. Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| [[Shelly Boston]] || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.

The name refers to [[Nemours]] in the [[\u00cele-de-France]] region of north-central [[France]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, the '''Lordship of Nemours''', in the [[Gatinais]], [[France]], was a possession of the house of [[Villeb\u00e9on]], a member of which, [[Gautier III of Nemours|Gautier]], was [[marshal of France]] in the middle of the 13th century. The lordship was sold to King [[Philip III of France]] in 1274 and 1276 by [[Jean de Nemours|Jean]] and [[Philippe de Nemours]]. It was then made a [[county]] and given in 1364 to [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch]]. \n\nIn 1404, [[Charles VI of France]] gave it to [[Charles II of Navarre|Charles III of Navarre]] and elevated it into a [[duchy]] in the peerage of France, in exchange to his ancestral [[county of \u00c9vreux]] in Normandy.\n\nAfter being confiscated and restored several times, the duchy reverted to the French crown in 1504, after the extinction of the house of Armagnac-Pardiac. In 1507, it was given by [[Louis XII of France]] to his nephew, [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston de Foix]], who was killed at the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]] in 1512.\n\nThe duchy then returned to the [[Crown lands of France|royal domain]] and was detached from it successively for [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]] and his wife [[Philiberta of Savoy]] in 1515, for [[Louise of Savoy]] in 1524, and for [[Philippe, Duke of Nemours|Philip of Savoy, Count of Genevois]], in 1528. The descendants of Philip of Savoy held the duchy until its sale to [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\nIn 1672, Louis XIV gave it to his brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe de France, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose descendants held it until the [[French Revolution]]. It was one of the many subsidiary titles held by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The title of Duke of Nemours was afterwards given to [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Louis Charles d'Orl\u00e9ans]], the second son of King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe of the French]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Nemours, Lords and Dukes of|volume=19 |pages=369-370}}</ref>\n\n==List of lords==\n;House of Ch\u00e2teau-Landon\n*Orson (1120\u20131148)\n*Aveline (1148\u20131174), died 1196\n\nAveline married Walter of Villeb\u00e9on, lord of [[Beaumont-du-G\u00e2tinais]], in 1150 and shared the lordship with him.

The name refers to [[Nemours]] in the [[\u00cele-de-France]] region of north-central [[France]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, the '''Lordship of Nemours''', in the [[Gatinais]], [[France]], was a possession of the house of [[Villeb\u00e9on]], a member of which, [[Gautier III of Nemours|Gautier]], was [[marshal of France]] in the middle of the 13th century. The lordship was sold to King [[Philip III of France]] in 1274 and 1276 by [[Jean de Nemours|Jean]] and [[Philippe de Nemours]]. It was then made a [[county]] and given in 1364 to [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch]]. \n\nIn 1404, [[Charles VI of France]] gave it to [[Charles II of Navarre|Charles III of Navarre]] and erected it into a [[duchy]] in the peerage of France, in exchange to his ancestral [[county of \u00c9vreux]] in Normandy.\n\nAfter being confiscated and restored several times, the duchy reverted to the French crown in 1504, after the extinction of the house of Armagnac-Pardiac. In 1507, it was given by [[Louis XII of France]] to his nephew, [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston de Foix]], who was killed at the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]] in 1512.\n\nThe duchy then returned to the [[Crown lands of France|royal domain]] and was detached from it successively for [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]] and his wife [[Philiberta of Savoy]] in 1515, for [[Louise of Savoy]] in 1524, and for [[Philippe, Duke of Nemours|Philip of Savoy, Count of Genevois]], in 1528. The descendants of Philip of Savoy held the duchy until its sale to [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\nIn 1672, Louis XIV gave it to his brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe de France, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose descendants held it until the [[French Revolution]]. It was one of the many subsidiary titles held by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The title of Duke of Nemours was afterwards given to [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Louis Charles d'Orl\u00e9ans]], the second son of King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe of the French]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Nemours, Lords and Dukes of|volume=19 |pages=369-370}}</ref> \n\n==List of lords==\n;House of Ch\u00e2teau-Landon\n*Orson (1120\u20131148)\n*Aveline (1148\u20131174), died 1196\n\nAveline married Walter of Villeb\u00e9on, lord of [[Beaumont-du-G\u00e2tinais]], in 1150 and shared the lordship with him.
