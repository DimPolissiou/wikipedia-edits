Clockwise from top: Ainz, Demiurge, Sebas, Albedo and Cocytus, Shalltear, Mare, and Aura.}}\nThis is a list of characters appearing in the novel series ''[[Overlord (novel series)|Overlord]]'', written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin, and its [[anime]] and [[manga]] adaptations.\n\n==Great Tomb of Nazarick==\nThe {{Nihongo|Great Tomb of Nazarick|\u30ca\u30b6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af \u5730\u4e0b\u5927\u58b3\u5893|Nazarikku Chika Dai Funbo}}, usually referred to as Nazarick, is the guild headquarters of the guild {{Nihongo|Ainz Ooal Gown|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} in YGGDRASIL. Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's an automaton who fights using guns and war knives. While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured. Being a Slime, she preys on humans and generally despises and looks down on them.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Entoma Vasilissa Zeta|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fb\u30bc\u30fc\u30bf|Entoma Vuashirissa Z\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kei Shindo]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Tia Ballard]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is an Insectoid who disguises herself as a human by wearing a mask and changing her voice. She is an entomancer, being able to summon fellow Insectoids. Being an Insectoid, she preys on humans when hungry, but otherwise doesn't consider them worth her attention. She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Rose, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick. She has the body of a human but the head of a Shetland Sheepdog with a vertical scar on her face running down the center of her face. She harbors no dislike towards human and is even willing to rescue them from her fellow NPCs' cruelty.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Eclair Ecleir Eicler|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30a4\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fc|\nEkurea Ekur\u0113ru Eikure\u0101}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Kyle Phillips}}\n:The assistant butler of Nazarick. He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him. Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared. She was then revealed that be the older sister of Ninya Berion, who Ainz felt indebted to, causing him to take her under his protection. As of now, she remains unaware of her younger sister's passing.\n\n====Carne Village====\n{{Nihongo|Carne Village|\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u6751|Karune Mura}} is a small village located at the border of the Re-Estize Kingdom, close to the Great {{Nihongo|Forest of Tob|\u30c8\u30d6\u306e\u5927\u68ee\u6797|Tobu No Dai Shinrin}} where various demi-humans, including Nazarick, reside.\n\nAfter Ainz saved the village from the Slane Theocracy, the villagers become loyal to him, even siding with Nazarick when it went to war with the Re-Estize Kingdom. The village has since started to take in other races including: Goblins summoned by an item Ainz gave them, Ogres from the Great Forest of Tob, and Dwarfs from the Dwarf Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enri Emmot|\u30a8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Enri Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mao Ichimichi|M\u00b7A\u00b7O]] (anime)|Skyler McIntosh}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture. Ainz gives her 2 Goblin-Summoning Horns that she would eventually use to protect her village. Enri shares a close bond with her childhood friend, and lover after the events of the 8th light novel, Nfirea.

In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He regains his will, when he sees Climb, withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she personally faced him. Unfortunately, she was taken captive and used as a blunt weapon to, very literally, beat her own soldiers before later dying while in captivity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Caspond Bessarez|\u30ab\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30b5\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9|Kasupondo Bes\u0101resu}}\n:The current Holy King and the older brother of the Holy Queen Calca. Despite being the elder brother, he gave up his claim to the throne. After Jaldabaoth laid siege to the Northern Holy Kingdom, he was taken prisoner by Demi-Humans until he was rescued by the \"Holy Kingdom Liberation Army\". Afterwards, he took command of the Liberation Army and led it to victory. Unbeknownst to the public, however, the 'real' Caspond is long dead, replaced by a D\u00f6ppelganger serving Demiurge and is currently working to destabilize the Holy Kingdom.\n\n====Temple of the Four Great Gods====\nThe Temple of the Four Great Gods is the primary religious institution of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kelart Custodio|\u30b1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Keraruto Kasutodio}}\n:The High Priestess of Holy Kingdom and younger sister of Remedios. She is similar to her sister, but calmer. She is also a powerful magic caster by New World standards. When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she was by Holy Queen Calca's side as she faced him, but they were defeated and she was killed. Her head was later taken by a demon and used for magic, before the demon was defeated by Neia and CZ.\n\n====Nine Colors====\nThe {{Nihongo|Nine Colors|\u4e5d\u8272|Ky\u016b-shoku}} is a group of individuals who's skills were recognized by the Holy Kingdom. Each member is titled after a color.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pavel Baraja|\u30d1\u30d9\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30e9\u30cf|Paberu Baraha}}\n:One of the Nine Colors and Neia Baraja's father. He was an expert archer.

He possessed a unique technique that was so powerful that it would result in his weapon breaking. Because of this, he carried up to eight swords with him into battle. He was killed when Jaldabaoth (Demiurge in disguise) attacked the Holy Kingdom. His Color is unknown.\n\n===Others===\nCharacters and organizations not allied with any nation or larger group.\n\n====Thirteen Heroes====\nThe {{Nihongo|Thirteen Heroes|\u5341\u4e09\u82f1\u96c4|J\u016bsan Eiy\u016b}} is a group of legendary figures in the New World. 200 years ago, they defeated the monsters known as the \"Evil Deities\" (who were strongly hinted to be NPCs from YGGDRASIL). At least two of members, including the leader, were Players from YGGDRASIL. Also, despite the name, there were actually more than thirteen members. However, the others were non-humans and thus weren't honored.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rigrit Bers Caurau|\u30ea\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30fb\u30ab\u30a6\u30e9\u30a6|Riguritto Berus\u016b Kaurau}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Wendy Powell]]}}\n:A member of the Thirteen Heroes 200 years ago. She is a Necromancer who used her abilities to extend her life beyond natural limits. Despite her age, she maintains a cheerful and mischievous personality. She was also a member of Blue Rose for a while, being the one who transformed it into a top-ranked Adventurer group, but retired and forced Evileye to take her place on the team. She sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Dragon Lords====\n{{Nihongo|Dragon Lord|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9|Doragonr\u014ddo}} is a title for the most powerful dragons in the New World. As dragons are the strongest species, Dragon Lords are the strongest beings in the New World. However, around 500 years ago, they went to war with the YGGDRASIL players known as the {{Nihongo|Eight Greed Kings|\u516b\u6b32\u738b|Hachiyoku-o}} and lost, resulting in their kind being reduced to a handful.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsaindorcus Vaision|\u30c4\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\uff1d\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Tsuaindorukusu vuaishion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jin Yamanoi]]|[[R. Bruce Elliot]]}}\n:Also known as the 'Platinum Dragon Lord'; he is a Dragon Lord and presumably the 'most powerful being in the New World'. He resides at the castle of the former Eight Greed Kings, guarding their magic items to prevent them from ever falling into the wrong hands. He sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Zurrernorn====\n{{Nihongo|Zurrernorn|\u30ba\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30f3|Z\u016br\u0101n\u014dn}} is a criminal cult infamous for its uses of necromancy and the Undead.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Clementine|\u30af\u30ec\u30de\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30cc|Kuremant\u012bnu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (drama CD, anime)|Mikaela Krantz}}\n:A rogue warrior and a former member of the Slane Theocracy\u00b4s Black Scripture. She was psychopath who wears armor made from medals from Adventurers she has slain. She was not an actual member of Zurrernorn, but merely associated with them for protection.

However, her body mysteriously disappeared in the aftermath.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Khajiit Dale Badantel|\u30ab\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb|Kajitto Deiru Badant\u0113ru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Minoru Inaba]] (drama CD, anime)|Brad Venable}}\n:One of the twelve core members of Zuranon.

Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades.

While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured.

He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance.

She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens.

Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision.

Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared. She was then revealed that be the older sister of Ninya Berion, who Ainz felt indebted to, causing him to take her under his protection. As of now, she remains unaware of her younger sister's passing.\n\n====Carne Village====\n{{Nihongo|Carne Village|\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u6751|Karune Mura}} is a small village located at the border of the Re-Estize Kingdom, close to the Great {{Nihongo|Forest of Tob|\u30c8\u30d6\u306e\u5927\u68ee\u6797|Tobu No Dai Shinrin}} where various demi-humans, including Nazarick, reside.\n\nAfter Ainz saved the village from the Slane Theocracy, the villagers become loyal to him, even siding with Nazarick when it went to war with the Re-Estize Kingdom.

He manages to create a Purple potion, out of materials from Nazarick and the new world, which works better than the blue potion but still less than Yggdrasil's Red Potion. Ainz is pleased with this step forward but hopes that he can at least make this kind of potion out of materials from the New World. It is revealed in the 11th light novel, that he and Enri have gotten married and are living in their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brita|\u30d6\u30ea\u30bf|Burita}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]] (anime)|Katherine Bourne}}\n:The brash and often short-tempered leader of the vigilante committee of Carne Village and a former iron ranked adventurer.

This potion ends up saving her life during Shalltear's rampage, since it made the vampire interrogate her instead of just killing her. She quits being an adventurer after encountering Shalltear and moves to Carne Village, where she ends up assisting the people. She also joins the Villagers in fighting against the Kingdom and for Ainz in the 9th Novel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lizzie Bareare|\u30ea\u30a3\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Ryij\u012b Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ikuko Tani]] (anime)|[[Juli Erickson]]}}\n:Nfirea's grandmother, considered the best pharmacist in E-Rantel.

In response, the tribes formed an alliance, but were defeated.

They eventually become closer and marry and even have a son, who is an albino. She becomes a representative for the Lizard people, after the fight against Cocytus. She meets Ainz, talking to him in fear and respect, and he offers to bring back Zaryusu in return for her acting as an informant to him, for any sign of rebellion.

After Ainz killed his father, he convinces him to spare the remainder of his family.\n\n====Quagoa====\nThe {{Nihongo|Quagoa|\u30af\u30a2\u30b4\u30a2|Kuagoa}} are a race of mole-like demi-humans that inhabit the Azerlisia Mountains.

To this end, he waged war against the Dwarfs and forged an alliance with the Frost Dragons. However, this 'alliance' was little more than the Quagoa being the Frost Dragons' servants, causing the king to conspire against them. When Aura and Shalltear appeared before him and told him to surrender, the king was too stunted by the seemingly ridiculous demand to answer. As a result, he had to watch as the pair massacred his brethren. With his spirit broken, he swore servitude to Ainz to guarantee his race's survival.\n\n====Abelion Hills====\nThe {{Nihongo|Abelion Hills|\u30a2\u30d9\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3\u4e18\u9675|Aberion Ky\u016bry\u014d}} is a vast wilderness inhabited by all kinds of Demi-Human tribes who are constantly attempting to invade the neighboring Roble Holy Kingdom.\n\nJaldabaoth (Demiurge in disguise) conquered the Abelion Hills and had its inhabitants attack the Roble Holy Kingdom.

In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He regains his will, when he sees Climb, withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

However, he remains unaware of Renner's true nature. He is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent at fighting, making up for it with sheer effort.

Afterwards, he was ambushed and tortured to death by Lupsregina.\n\n===Slane Theocracy===\nThe {{Nihongo|Slane Theocracy|\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u6cd5\u56fd|Surein-h\u014d-Koku}}, usually referred to as the Theocracy, is a human nation neighboring Nazarick. It was founded over 600 years ago by the {{Nihongo|Six Great Gods|\u516d\u5927\u795e|Rokudaijin}}, who were heavily implied to have been Players from YGGDRASIL. It is the strongest human nation, promoting human supremacy and the persecution of other races. The {{Nihongo|Six Scriptures|\u516d\u8272\u8056\u5178|Rikushiki Seiten}} are secret divisions in the Slane Theocracy's military. They each correspond to one of the Six Great Gods and have their own beliefs, principles and doctrines.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Zesshi Zetsumei|\u7d76\u6b7b\u7d76\u547d|Zetsumei Zesshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yukari Tamura]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}\n:The present holder of the Extra Seat in the Black Scripture. She is a woman suffering from heterochromia, with one side of her hair and eyes being silver and the other half being black. She is heavily implied to be the illegitimate child of the Elf King of the Elf Country and a human woman who was known as the \"Ace\" of the Black Scripture, making her a half-elf.\n\n=====Sunlight Scripture=====\nThe {{Nihongo|Sunlight Scripture|\u3088\u3046\u3053\u3046\u305b\u3044\u3066\u3093|Y\u014dk\u014d Seiten}} was one the Six Scriptures of the Slane Theocracy, specializing in Demi-Human extermination.

He is highly arrogant and self-righteous, having led many secret genocides against innocent non-humans. He and his Scripture were hired by some corrupt nobles from the Re-Estize to assassinate Gazef Stronoff and would have succeeded if not for Ainz, who effortlessly defeated him. He was then taken captive and is tortured to death by Demiurge.\n\n=====Black Scripture=====\nThe {{Nihongo|Black Scripture|\u3057\u3063\u3053\u304f\u305b\u3044\u3066\u3093|Shikkoku Seiten}} is one of the Six Scriptures of the Slane Theocracy.

They are thus considered the Theocracy's trump card.\n\n;Black Scripture Captain\n:{{voiced by|Kentaro Tone|[[Mike McFarland]]}}\n:The current leader and 1st Seat holder of the Black Scripture. He appears to be a young man with long black hair and sharp red eyes. He also wears an ornate armor and wields a spear.\n\n===Roble Holy Kingdom===\nThe {{Nihongo|Roble Holy Kingdom|\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u8056\u738b\u56fd|R\u014dburu Sei \u014ckoku}}, usually referred to as the Holy Kingdom, is a human nation neighboring the Re-Estize Kingdom. It is neighbored by the Abelion Hills, which are inhabited by various demi-humans who are constantly trying to invade them. In order to keep them out, a huge wall, known as the \"Great Wall\", was built along the border. Jaldabaoth (Demiurge in disguise) laid siege to its northern regions using an army of Demi-Humans. Fortunately, a rebel force known as the \"Holy Kingdom Liberation Army\" was able to retake the North with aid from The Sorcerous Kingdom, not knowing they were behind the entire invasion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neia Baraja|\u30cd\u30a4\u30a2\u30fb\u30d0\u30e9\u30cf|Neia Baraha}}\n:A squire and the daughter of Pavel Baraja. She greatly admired her mother, who was a Paladin, and thus aspires to be one herself. However, she lacked her mother's talent and was ironically gifted with her father's archery skills instead. She also inherited her father's dark, glaring eyes that often give others a wrong impression of her. Upon meeting Ainz, she became infatuated by his belief that strength is required to protect others and she later becomes his guard after he agrees to aid the Holy Kingdom. During her service to him, Ainz lent her high-level equipment, causing her to be central in liberating the Northern Holy Kingdom. After the liberation, she became the leader of a cult that worships Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Remedios Custodio|\u30ec\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b9\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Remediosu Kasutodio}}\n:The former bodyguard of the late Holy Queen Calca as well as the elder sister of High-Priestess Kelart and the grandmaster of the Paladin Order.

After the fall of the Northern Holy Kingdom, she became a captain in the 'Holy Kingdom Liberation Army'. She holds prejudice towards demi-humans and distrusts Ainz, due to his undead nature, which only grows worse as he earns the citizens' trust. After the liberation, the new Holy King, Caspond, has her demoted.\n\n====Paladin Order====\nThe Paladin Order is the highest knight order in the Holy Kingdom, which its members specializing in both swordsmanship and magic.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gustav Montagn\u00e9s|\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fb\u30e2\u30f3\u30bf\u30cb\u30a7\u30b9|Gusut\u0101bo Montanyesu}}\n:An adjudant of the Paladin Order. Unlike his superior, Remedios, he is a realist who is willing to compromise on his ideals if necessary. Due to this, he often serves as an adviser as well as a voice of reason to her.

Unfortunately, she was taken captive and used as a blunt weapon to, very literally, beat her own soldiers before later dying while in captivity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Caspond Bessarez|\u30ab\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30b5\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9|Kasupondo Bes\u0101resu}}\n:The current Holy King and the older brother of the Holy Queen Calca. Despite being the elder brother, he gave up his claim to the throne. After Jaldabaoth laid siege to the Northern Holy Kingdom, he was taken prisoner by Demi-Humans until he was rescued by the \"Holy Kingdom Liberation Army\". Afterwards, he took command of the Liberation Army and led it to victory. Unbeknownst to the public, however, the 'real' Caspond is long dead, replaced by a D\u00f6ppelganger serving Demiurge and is currently working to destabilize the Holy Kingdom.\n\n====Temple of the Four Great Gods====\nThe Temple of the Four Great Gods is the primary religious institution of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kelart Custodio|\u30b1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Keraruto Kasutodio}}\n:The High Priestess of Holy Kingdom and younger sister of Remedios. She is similar to her sister, but calmer. She is also a powerful magic caster by New World standards.

By using the variant call format only the variations need to be stored along with a reference genome.\n\nThe standard is currently in version 4.3,<ref name=\"vcf-spec\">{{cite web|url=https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf|title=VCF Specification|accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs|title=Specifications of SAM/BAM and related high-throughput sequencing file formats|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> although the [[1000 Genomes Project]] has developed its own specification for structural variations such as duplications, which are not easily accommodated into the existing schema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/VCF%20(Variant%20Call%20Format)%20version%204.0/encoding-structural-variants|title=Encoding Structural Variants in VCF (Variant Call Format) version 4.0 &#124; 1000 Genomes|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>  There is also a '''Genomic VCF''' ('''gVCF''') extended format, which includes additional information about \"blocks\" that match the reference and their qualities.<ref>{{cite web |title=VCF/GVCF |url=https://wabi-wiki.scilifelab.se/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19988483 |website=Long-term support overview and knowledge base - WABI wiki |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> A set of tools is also available for editing and manipulating the files.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://vcftools.github.io/index.html|title=VCFtools from Github.io|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\n ##fileformat=VCFv4.3\n ##fileDate=20090805\n ##source=myImputationProgramV3.1\n ##reference=file:///seq/references/1000GenomesPilot-NCBI36.fasta\n ##contig=<ID=20,length=62435964,assembly=B36,md5=f126cdf8a6e0c7f379d618ff66beb2da,species=\"Homo sapiens\",taxonomy=x>\n ##phasing=partial\n ##INFO=<ID=NS,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\"Number of Samples With Data\">\n ##INFO=<ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\"Total Depth\">\n ##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description=\"Allele Frequency\">\n ##INFO=<ID=AA,Number=1,Type=String,Description=\"Ancestral Allele\">\n ##INFO=<ID=DB,Number=0,Type=Flag,Description=\"dbSNP membership, build 129\">\n ##INFO=<ID=H2,Number=0,Type=Flag,Description=\"HapMap2 membership\">\n ##FILTER=<ID=q10,Description=\"Quality below 10\">\n ##FILTER=<ID=s50,Description=\"Less than 50% of samples have data\">\n ##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description=\"Genotype\">\n ##FORMAT=<ID=GQ,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\"Genotype Quality\">\n ##FORMAT=<ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\"Read Depth\">\n ##FORMAT=<ID=HQ,Number=2,Type=Integer,Description=\"Haplotype Quality\">\n #CHROM POS      ID         REF   ALT    QUAL  FILTER   INFO                             FORMAT       NA00001         NA00002          NA00003\n 20     14370    rs6054257  G     A      29    PASS    NS=3;DP=14;AF=0.5;DB;H2           GT:GQ:DP:HQ  0|0:48:1:51,51  1|0:48:8:51,51   1/1:43:5:.,.\n 20     17330    .

In such a way the [[energy]] is quickly converted into [[heat]], and conducted by the free electrons along the magnetic field lines closer to the place where the nanoflare switches on. In order to heat a region of very high [[X-ray]] emission, over an area 1\" x 1\", a nanoflare of 10<sup>17</sup> J should happen every 20 seconds, and 1000 nanoflares per second should occur in a large active region of\n10<sup>5</sup> x 10<sup>5</sup> km<sup>2</sup>.\nOn the basis of this theory, the emission coming from a big flare could be caused by a series of micro-nanoflares, not observable individually.\n\nThe nanoflare model has long suffered from a lack of observational evidence. Simulations predict that nanoflares produce a faint, hot (~10 MK) component of the emission measure.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Klimchuk|first = Jim|title = On Solving the Coronal Heating Problem|journal = Solar Physics|volume = 234|issue = 1|pages = 41\u201377|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11207-006-0055-z|arxiv = astro-ph/0511841|bibcode = 2006SoPh..234...41K}}</ref> Unfortunately, current instruments, such as the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on board [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]], are not adequately sensitive to the range in which this faint emission occurs, making a confident detection impossible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Winebarger|first=Amy|last2=Warren|first2=Harry|last3=Schmelz|first3=Joan|last4=Cirtain|first4=Jonathan|last5=Mulu-Moor|first5=Fana|last6=Golub|first6=Leon|last7=Kobayashi|first7=Ken|title=Defining the Blind-Spot of Hinode EIS and XRT Temperature Measurements|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=746|issue=2|pages=L17|date=2012|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/746/2/L17|bibcode=2012ApJ...746L..17W}}</ref> \nRecent evidence from the EUNIS sounding rocket has provided some spectral evidence for non-flaring plasma at temperatures near 9 MK in active region cores.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brosius|first=Jeffrey|last2=Adrian|first2=Daw|last3=Rabin|first3=D.M.|title=Pervasive Faint Fe XIX Emission from a Solar Active Region Observed with EUNIS-13: Evidence for Nanoflare Heating|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=790|issue=2|pages=112|date=2014|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/790/2/112|bibcode=2014ApJ...790..112B}}</ref>\n\n== Nanoflares and coronal activity ==\n[[File:Solar flare (TRACE).gif|thumb|left|Typical flaring [[coronal loops]] observed by [[TRACE]] in the EUV rays]]\n\nTelescopic observations suggest that the [[solar magnetic field]], which theoretically is \"frozen\" into the gas of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[photosphere]], expands into roughly semicircular structures in the corona. These [[coronal loops]], which can be seen in the EUV and X-ray images (see the figure on the left), often confine very hot plasmas, with emissions characteristic of temperature of a one to a few million degrees.\n\nMany flux tubes are relatively stable as seen in soft X-ray images, emitting at steady rate. However flickerings, brightenings, small explosions, bright points, flares and mass eruptions are observed very frequently, especially in [[sunspot|active regions]]. These macroscopic signs of solar activity are considered by astrophysicists as the phenomenology related to events of relaxation of stressed magnetic fields, during which part of the energy they have stored is released ultimately into particle kinetic energy (heating); this could be via current dissipation, [[Joule heating|Joule effect]], or any of several non-thermal plasma effects.\n\nTheoretical work often appeals to the concept of [[magnetic reconnection]] to explain these outbursts.\nRather than a single large-scale episode of such a process, though,  modern thinking suggests that a \nmultitude of small-scale versions reconnection, cascading together, might be a better description.\nThe theory of nanoflares then supposes that these events of magnetic reconnection, occurring at nearly the same time on small length-scales wherever in the corona, are very numerous, each providing an imperceptibly small fraction of the total energy required in a macroscopic event.\nThese nanoflares might themselves resemble very tiny flares, close one to each other, both in time and in space, effectively heating the corona and underlying many of the phenomena of solar magnetic activity.\n\nEpisodic heating often observed in [[sunspot|active regions]], including major events such as [[solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]] could be provoked by cascade effects, similar to those described by the mathematical theories of catastrophes. In the hypothesis that the solar corona is in a state of [[self-organized criticality]], the stressing of the magnetic field should be enhanced until a small perturbation switches on many small instabilities, happening together as it occurs in avalanches.\n\nOne of the experimental results often cited in supporting the nanoflare theory is the fact that the distribution of the number of flares observed in the hard X-rays is a function of their energy, following a power law with negative spectral index. A sufficiently large power-law index would allow the smallest events to dominate the total energy. In the energy range of normal flares, the index has a value of approximately -1.8<ref>{{cite journal| last = Datlowe | first = D.W.| last2 = Elcan| first2 = M. J.| last3 = Hudson| first3 = H.

The energy released in the corona which is not radiated externally is conducted back towards the [[chromosphere]] along the arcs.\nIn the [[solar transition region|transition region]] where the temperature is about 10<sup>4</sup> -10<sup>5</sup> K, radiative losses are too high to be balanced by any form of mechanical heating\n.<ref>{{cite book | last = Priest | first = Eric | title = Solar Magneto-hydrodynamics | publisher = D.Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland | page = 208 | date = 1982}}</ref>\nThe very high temperature gradient observed in this range of temperatures increases the conductive flux in order to supply for the irradiated power.\nIn other words, the transition region is so steep (the temperature increases from 10kK to 1MK in a distance of the order of 100&nbsp;km) because the thermal conduction from the superior hotter atmosphere must balance the high radiative losses, as indicated to the numerous [[emission lines]], which are formed from ionized atoms (oxygen, carbon, iron and so on).\n\nThe solar convection can supply the required heating, but in a way not yet known in detail. Actually, it is still unclear how this energy is transmitted from the chromosphere(where it could be absorbed or reflected), and then dissipated into the corona instead of dispersing into the solar wind.\nFurthermore, where does it occur exactly ? : in the low [[solar corona|corona]] or mainly in the higher corona, where the magnetic field lines open into the space [[heliosphere]], driving the [[solar wind]] into the [[solar system]].\n\nThe importance of the magnetic field is recognized by all the scientists:\nthere is a strict correspondence between the [[stellar active region|active regions]], where the irradiated flux is higher (especially in the X-rays), and the regions of intense magnetic field.<ref name=Poletto>{{ cite journal |author=Poletto G |display-authors=4 |author2=Vaiana GS |author3=Zombeck MV |author4=Krieger AS |author5=Timothy AF |title=A comparison of coronal X-ray structures of active regions with magnetic fields computed from photospheric observations |journal=Solar Physics |date=Sep 1975 |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=83\u201399 |doi=10.1007/BF00156848 |bibcode=1975SoPh...44...83P }}</ref>\n\nThe problem of coronal heating is complicated by the fact that different coronal features require very different amounts of energy.\nIt is difficult to believe that very dynamic and energetic phenomena such as flares and coronal mass ejections share the same source of energy with stable structures covering very large areas on the Sun: if nanoflares would have heated the whole corona, then they should be distributed so uniformly so as to look like a steady heating.\nFlares themselves&nbsp;\u2013 and microflares, which when studied in detail seem to have the same physics&nbsp;\u2013 are highly intermittent in space and time, and would not therefore be relevant to any requirement for continuous heating.\nOn the other hand, in order to explain very rapid and energetic phenomena such as solar flares, the magnetic field should be structured on distances of the order of the metre.\n\n[[File:Solar Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection 2010-02-12.jpg|thumb|left|Solar Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection ([[STEREO]])]]\nThe [[Alfv\u00e9n waves]] generated by convective motions in the [[photosphere]] can go through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], carrying an energy flux comparable to that required to sustain the [[solar corona|corona]].\nAnyway, wavetrain periods observed in the high chromosphere and in the lower transition region are of the order of 3-5 min. These times are longer than the time taken by Alfv\u00e9n waves to cross a typical coronal loop. This means that most of the dissipative mechanisms may provide enough energy only at distances further from the solar corona.\nMore probably, the Alfv\u00e9n waves are responsible for the acceleration of the [[solar wind]] in [[coronal holes]].\n\nThe theory initially developed by Parker of micro-nanoflares is one of those explaining the heating of the corona as the dissipation of electric currents generated by a spontaneous relaxation of the magnetic field towards a configuration of lower energy.\nThe magnetic energy is thus transformed into [[Joule heating]].\nThe braiding of the field lines of the coronal magnetic flux tubes provokes events of [[magnetic reconnection]] with a consequent change of the [[magnetic field]] at small length-scales without a simultaneous alteration of the magnetic field lines at large length-scales.\nIn this way it can be explained why [[coronal loops]] are stable and so hot at the same time.\n\nThe Ohmic dissipation by currents could be a valid alternative to explain the coronal activity. For many years the [[magnetic reconnection]] has been invoked as the main power source of [[solar flares]]. However this heating mechanism is not very efficient in large [[current sheets]], while more energy is released in turbulent regimes when nanoflares happen at much smaller scale-lengths, where non-linear effects are not negligible.<ref name=Rappazzo>{{cite journal |author= Rappazzo, A.

In such a way the [[energy]] is quickly converted into [[heat]], and conducted by the free electrons along the magnetic field lines closer to the place where the nanoflare switches on. In order to heat a region of very high [[X-ray]] emission, over an area 1\" x 1\", a nanoflare of 10<sup>17</sup> J should happen every 20 seconds, and 1000 nanoflares per second should occur in a large active region of\n10<sup>5</sup> x 10<sup>5</sup> km<sup>2</sup>.\nOn the basis of this theory, the emission coming from a big flare could be caused by a series of micro-nanoflares, not observable individually.\n\nThe nanoflare model has long suffered from a lack of observational evidence. Simulations predict that nanoflares produce a faint, hot (~10 MK) component of the emission measure.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Klimchuk|first = Jim|title = On Solving the Coronal Heating Problem|journal = Solar Physics|volume = 234|issue = 1|pages = 41\u201377|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11207-006-0055-z|arxiv = astro-ph/0511841|bibcode = 2006SoPh..234...41K}}</ref> Unfortunately, current instruments, such as the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on board [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]], are not adequately sensitive to the range in which this faint emission occurs, making a confident detection impossible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Winebarger|first=Amy|last2=Warren|first2=Harry|last3=Schmelz|first3=Joan|last4=Cirtain|first4=Jonathan|last5=Mulu-Moor|first5=Fana|last6=Golub|first6=Leon|last7=Kobayashi|first7=Ken|title=Defining the Blind-Spot of Hinode EIS and XRT Temperature Measurements|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=746|issue=2|pages=L17|date=2012|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/746/2/L17|bibcode=2012ApJ...746L..17W}}</ref> \nRecent evidence from the EUNIS sounding rocket has provided some spectral evidence for non-flaring plasma at temperatures near 9 MK in active region cores.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brosius|first=Jeffrey|last2=Adrian|first2=Daw|last3=Rabin|first3=D.M.|title=Pervasive Faint Fe XIX Emission from a Solar Active Region Observed with EUNIS-13: Evidence for Nanoflare Heating|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=790|issue=2|pages=112|date=2014|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/790/2/112|bibcode=2014ApJ...790..112B}}</ref>\n\n== Nanoflares and coronal activity ==\n[[File:Solar flare (TRACE).gif|thumb|left|Typical flaring [[coronal loops]] observed by [[TRACE]] in the EUV rays]]\n\nTelescopic observations suggest that the [[solar magnetic field]], which theoretically is \"frozen\" into the gas of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[photosphere]], expands into roughly semicircular structures in the corona. These [[coronal loops]], which can be seen in the EUV and X-ray images (see the figure on the left), often confine very hot plasmas, with emissions characteristic of temperature of a one to a few million degrees.\n\nMany flux tubes are relatively stable as seen in soft X-ray images, emitting at steady rate. However flickerings, brightenings, small explosions, bright points, flares and mass eruptions are observed very frequently, especially in [[sunspot|active regions]]. These macroscopic signs of solar activity are considered by astrophysicists as the phenomenology related to events of relaxation of stressed magnetic fields, during which part of the energy they have stored is released ultimately into particle kinetic energy (heating); this could be via current dissipation, [[Joule heating|Joule effect]], or any of several non-thermal plasma effects.\n\nTheoretical work often appeals to the concept of [[magnetic reconnection]] to explain these outbursts.\nRather than a single large-scale episode of such a process, though,  modern thinking suggests that a \nmultitude of small-scale versions reconnection, cascading together, might be a better description.\nThe theory of nanoflares then supposes that these events of magnetic reconnection, occurring at nearly the same time on small length-scales wherever in the corona, are very numerous, each providing an imperceptibly small fraction of the total energy required in a macroscopic event.\nThese nanoflares might themselves resemble very tiny flares, close one to each other, both in time and in space, effectively heating the corona and underlying many of the phenomena of solar magnetic activity.\n\nEpisodic heating often observed in [[sunspot|active regions]], including major events such as [[solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]] could be provoked by cascade effects, similar to those described by the mathematical theories of catastrophes. In the hypothesis that the solar corona is in a state of [[self-organized criticality]], the stressing of the magnetic field should be enhanced until a small perturbation switches on many small instabilities, happening together as it occurs in avalanches.\n\nOne of the experimental results often cited in supporting the nanoflare theory is the fact that the distribution of the number of flares observed in the hard X-rays is a function of their energy, following a power law with negative spectral index. A sufficiently large power-law index would allow the smallest events to dominate the total energy. In the energy range of normal flares, the index has a value of approximately -1.8<ref>{{cite journal| last = Datlowe | first = D.W.| last2 = Elcan| first2 = M. J.| last3 = Hudson| first3 = H.

The energy released in the corona which is not radiated externally is conducted back towards the [[chromosphere]] along the arcs.\nIn the [[solar transition region|transition region]] where the temperature is about 10<sup>4</sup> -10<sup>5</sup> K, radiative losses are too high to be balanced by any form of mechanical heating\n.<ref>{{cite book | last = Priest | first = Eric | title = Solar Magneto-hydrodynamics | publisher = D.Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland | page = 208 | date = 1982}}</ref>\nThe very high temperature gradient observed in this range of temperatures increases the conductive flux in order to supply for the irradiated power.\nIn other words, the transition region is so steep (the temperature increases from 10kK to 1MK in a distance of the order of 100&nbsp;km) because the thermal conduction from the superior hotter atmosphere must balance the high radiative losses, as indicated to the numerous [[emission lines]], which are formed from ionized atoms (oxygen, carbon, iron and so on).\n\nThe solar convection can supply the required heating, but in a way not yet known in detail. Actually, it is still unclear how this energy is transmitted from the chromosphere(where it could be absorbed or reflected), and then dissipated into the corona instead of dispersing into the solar wind.\nFurthermore, where does it occur exactly ? : in the low [[corona]] or mainly in the higher corona, where the magnetic field lines open into the space [[heliosphere]], driving the [[solar wind]] into the [[solar system]].\n\nThe importance of the magnetic field is recognized by all the scientists:\nthere is a strict correspondence between the [[stellar active region|active regions]], where the irradiated flux is higher (especially in the X-rays), and the regions of intense magnetic field.<ref name=Poletto>{{ cite journal |author=Poletto G |display-authors=4 |author2=Vaiana GS |author3=Zombeck MV |author4=Krieger AS |author5=Timothy AF |title=A comparison of coronal X-ray structures of active regions with magnetic fields computed from photospheric observations |journal=Solar Physics |date=Sep 1975 |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=83\u201399 |doi=10.1007/BF00156848 |bibcode=1975SoPh...44...83P }}</ref>\n\nThe problem of coronal heating is complicated by the fact that different coronal features require very different amounts of energy.\nIt is difficult to believe that very dynamic and energetic phenomena such as flares and coronal mass ejections share the same source of energy with stable structures covering very large areas on the Sun: if nanoflares would have heated the whole corona, then they should be distributed so uniformly so as to look like a steady heating.\nFlares themselves&nbsp;\u2013 and microflares, which when studied in detail seem to have the same physics&nbsp;\u2013 are highly intermittent in space and time, and would not therefore be relevant to any requirement for continuous heating.\nOn the other hand, in order to explain very rapid and energetic phenomena such as solar flares, the magnetic field should be structured on distances of the order of the metre.\n\n[[File:Solar Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection 2010-02-12.jpg|thumb|left|Solar Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection ([[STEREO]])]]\nThe [[Alfv\u00e9n waves]] generated by convective motions in the [[photosphere]] can go through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], carrying an energy flux comparable to that required to sustain the [[corona]].\nAnyway, wavetrain periods observed in the high chromosphere and in the lower transition region are of the order of 3-5 min. These times are longer than the time taken by Alfv\u00e9n waves to cross a typical coronal loop. This means that most of the dissipative mechanisms may provide enough energy only at distances further from the solar corona.\nMore probably, the Alfv\u00e9n waves are responsible for the acceleration of the [[solar wind]] in [[coronal holes]].\n\nThe theory initially developed by Parker of micro-nanoflares is one of those explaining the heating of the corona as the dissipation of electric currents generated by a spontaneous relaxation of the magnetic field towards a configuration of lower energy.\nThe magnetic energy is thus transformed into [[Joule heating]].\nThe braiding of the field lines of the coronal magnetic flux tubes provokes events of [[magnetic reconnection]] with a consequent change of the [[magnetic field]] at small length-scales without a simultaneous alteration of the magnetic field lines at large length-scales.\nIn this way it can be explained why [[coronal loops]] are stable and so hot at the same time.\n\nThe Ohmic dissipation by currents could be a valid alternative to explain the coronal activity. For many years the [[magnetic reconnection]] has been invoked as the main power source of [[solar flares]]. However this heating mechanism is not very efficient in large [[current sheets]], while more energy is released in turbulent regimes when nanoflares happen at much smaller scale-lengths, where non-linear effects are not negligible.<ref name=Rappazzo>{{cite journal |author= Rappazzo, A.

Commanded by Juco Rukavina, it was the first of twenty-six [[concentration camp]]s in the NDH during the war. Established in a secluded area about {{convert|20|km}} from the town of [[Gospi\u0107]], it held thousands of [[Serbs]] and [[Jews]] over a period of 122 days from May to August 1941. Inmates were usually killed by being pushed into deep ravines located near the camp. Estimates of the number of deaths at Jadovno range from 10,000 to 68,000, mostly Serbs. The camp was closed on 21 August 1941, and the area where it was located was later handed over to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and became part of Italian Zones II and III. Jadovno was replaced by the greater sized [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] and its extermination facilities.\n\nThe camp site remained unexplored after the war due to the depth of the gorges where bodies were disposed and the fact that some of them had been filled with [[concrete]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Communist]] authorities. Additional sites containing the skeletal remains of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s. Commemoration ceremonies honouring the victims of the camp have been organized by the [[Serb National Council]] (SNV), the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009, and [[24 June]] has since been designated as a \"Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp\" in Croatia. A monument commemorating those killed in the camp was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Poorly equipped and trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} After the invasion, the extreme [[Croats|Croat]] nationalist and fascist [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\") of an [[Usta\u0161e]]-led Croatian state&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (often called the NDH, from the {{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}).{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} The NDH combined most of modern [[Croatia]], all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of modern [[Serbia]] into an \"Italian-German quasi-protectorate\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} NDH authorities, led by the [[Usta\u0161e militia]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=397\u2013409}} then implemented genocidal policies against the [[Serb]], [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] populations living in the new state.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20\u201324}}\n\nAiming to exterminate the entire Serb population of the NDH,{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=224}} the Usta\u0161e sought to murder one-third of Serbs, convert one-third to [[Roman Catholicism]], and force the rest from the country.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=165}} A series of massacres were committed by the Usta\u0161e, and the degree of cruelty with which the Serb population was persecuted shocked even the Germans.{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=225}}\n\nThe [[Cyrillic script]] was banned, [[Orthodox Christian]] church schools were closed, and Serbs were ordered to wear identifying armbands.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=126}} Similar measures were enacted against Jews, who were required to wear a yellow armband with a black-on-yellow [[Star of David]] for identification. These armbands bore the word \"Jew\" in two languages: [[German language|German]] (\"''Jude''\") and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (\"''\u017didov''\").{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=174}}\n\n===Operation===\nLocated in a secluded area about {{convert|20|km}} from the town of [[Gospi\u0107]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} the Jadovno camp was formed during the early stages of the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution of Serbs]] in the NDH{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} and was placed under the command of the Usta\u0161a [[Juco Rukavina]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Intended as an [[extermination camp]], it was established between 11 and 15 April 1941{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} and was the first of twenty-six [[concentration camp]]s located in the NDH during the war.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=184}}\n\nMost inmates at Usta\u0161e camps&nbsp;\u2013 including Jadovno&nbsp;\u2013 were [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=747}} Other victims included Jews and anti-Usta\u0161e Croats.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Notable Jadovno inmates included the [[Jews in Croatia|Croatian Jewish]] mayor of [[Koprivnica]], [[Ivica Hir\u0161l]],{{sfn|Kraus|1998|p=382}} and the [[Jews in Croatia|Croatian Jewish]] [[Communist]] [[Aleksandar Savi\u0107]].{{sfn|Romano|1980|p=478}}\n\nImmediately, the Usta\u0161e trucked several hundred detainees to a site intended almost exclusively for extermination near [[Gospi\u0107]]. Located on Mount [[Velebit]], the town contained gorges&nbsp;\u2013 some up to {{convert|91.5|m}} deep&nbsp;\u2013 that were used as dumping grounds.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} The Jadovno camp itself was surrounded by such abysses ({{lang-sh|jame}}) which were difficult to gain access to and characteristic of the [[karst]]ic mountain range. The camp itself acted as a \"way station\" en route to these pits.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Here, prisoners had to work the entire day with almost no food until exhaustion.\n\nThe nearest pit to the camp was the \u0160aran pit, located {{convert|1|km}} away, while the pit where inmates were executed and dumped was {{convert|5|km}} from the camp.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}} Here, inmates were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects. Afterwards, an entire row of inmates were pushed into the ravine.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}} In some cases, inmates were also killed by gunfire, as well as with knives and blunt objects. Once inmates were thrown into the ravine, [[hand grenade]]s were hurtled inside in order to kill off the victims. Dogs would also be thrown in to feed on the wounded and the dead.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}} The pits in the vicinity of the camp were filled with the bodies of Jewish and later Serb inmates. However, killings were not confined to these two groups, and the bodies of some Croats and Roma were disposed of in this fashion as well.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}}\n\nBy the end of June, the Usta\u0161e transferred several hundred Jewish families from [[Zagreb]] to Jadovno.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=91}} Afterwards, the camp was visited by Usta\u0161e commander [[Vjekoslav Luburi\u0107]], who opened his visit by cutting the throat of a two-year-old Jewish child. Luburi\u0107 then forced a camp guard to murder and squash the skull of a second child with his foot.{{sfn|Balen|1952|pp=78\u201380}} The last group of inmates at Jadovno were killed with [[machine gun]]s.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}}\n\nThe camp was closed on 21 August 1941, and the remaining Croat inmates were transferred to other NDH-controlled camps, while the remaining Serbs and Jews were murdered.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} Work on the replacement [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] started in the same month. The area in which the Jadovno camp was located was later handed over to the Italians{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=91}} and became part of Italian Zones II and III.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=399}}\n\n=== Italian medical team report ===\nIn September 1941, two Italian army medical teams were sent to investigate reports of mass graves contaminating drinking water across the Velebit mountains and on the island of Pag, all part of the Jadovno system of Usta\u0161e camps and killing pits. This is the Italian medical officer\u2019s description of the Plana pit, located above the village of Bu\u0111ak, on Velebit:<blockquote>In the area around the pit I found pieces of chains, padlocks of various sizes and shapes, railway employee badges, ribbons from trousers of Yugoslav customs officers, toothbrushes, pocket mirrors, combs, and very interestingly, emptied and torn wallets. On one spot I found pieces of a skull for which I believe to belong to an adult person between age 30 and 50, killed approximately two months before. The opening of the pit is 8x5m in size, and it seems to have no bottom. A rock I threw in did not stop, but fell so deeply that I could not hear it hit the bottom. The rim of the pit and its sides were covered with lime that seemed to be used several days before. Despite that the whole area is full of terrible smell of decomposing corpses. It seems that around 500 victims were thrown into this pit.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://jadovno.com/original-documents-of-italian-military-medical-service/#.XoU1ZYhKjIU|title=Charon and Destinies, Original documents of Italian military medical service|last=Zemljar|first=Ante|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://jadovno.com/translation-of-original-italian-documents/#.XoUyeohKjIU|title=Charon and Destinies, Translation of original Italian documents|last=Zemljar|first=Ante|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>The Italian team discovered additional Velebit killing pits - Jamina pit, near Tribnje (\u201chundreds of victims\u201d, including women and children), Jama na Plo\u010dama, near Stupa\u010dinovo (2.000 Serb victims), Duliba jama (200 victims), etc. The team leader notes that due to very difficult terrain and animosity of many locals, they were unable to locate other suspected killing pits. Beyond that, the Italian medical teams investigated the [[Slana concentration camp|Slana]] and Metajna concentration camps on Pag island, part of the same system of Usta\u0161e camps, where they dug up 791 corpses in mass graves, with nearly half being women and children, and estimated 8 to 9 thousand were killed by the Usta\u0161e in the camps on Pag.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Death toll==\n [[File:Jadovno na Velebitu.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Monument to the victims of the camp.]]\nThe number of deaths at the camp is difficult to establish as many inmates often went unregistered as they were taken directly to the edge of ravines and murdered.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} The highest recorded estimate of Jadovno deaths was made in 1942 by a former inmate of the Gospi\u0107 prison, who claimed that 120,000 people were killed. In 1964, a survey of World War II victims by the War Victim Census Commission showed a figure of 1,794 individual victims in Jadovno. The results of this survey were not published until 1989.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=730}}\n\nThe 1960 edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia]]'' states at least 35,000 were killed in Jadovno, with a possible final death toll of 50,000\u201360,000.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}} The 1967 ''Military Encyclopedia'' of Yugoslavia estimates that 72,000 inmates perished in the camp.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} The 1971 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia'' also revised the number to 72,000, which became the most commonly cited estimate in the 1960s and the 1970s.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|pp=730\u201331}} Rev Atanasije Jevti\u0107 stated in 1983 that 80,000 inmates were killed. Historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] said this claim was \"exaggerated\" and not based on any documentation or detailed investigation.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Historian estimates in the late 1980s and the 1990s mostly ranged from 15,000 to 48,000 victims.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=733}}\n\nA 2007 research study by historian \u0110uro Zatezalo, using 17 archives,{{sfn|Mirkovic|2010}} estimated that the total number of deaths at the camp was 40,123 (38,010 Serbs, 1,998 Jews, 88 Croats and 27 others) and listed the names of 10,502 identified victims, of whom 9,663 were Serbs, 762 Jews, 55 Croats and 22 others.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|pp=730\u201331}} 1,029 children were identified (1,014 Serb and 15 Jewish),{{sfn|Mirkovic|2010}} as was 55 [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priests according to Zatezalo's data. As it operated over a period of 122 days, this would suggest that an average of 329 people were killed there every day.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} Paul Mojzes cites Zatezalos's data.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a 2009 research by the Belgrade Museum of Genocide Victims, between 15,300\u201315,900 people were killed in the Gospi\u0107, Jadovno and Pag camps.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=732}} Sources generally offer a range of 10,000\u201368,000 deaths at the camp. Estimates of the number of Jewish deaths range from several hundred{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} to 2,500\u20132,800.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nThe Jadovno camp site remained unexplored after the war due to the depth of the gorges where bodies were disposed of and the fact that some of these had been filled with concrete by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Communist]] authorities. Additional sites containing the skeletal remains of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}\n\nCommemoration ceremonies honouring the victims of the camp have been organized by the [[Serb National Council]] (SNV), representatives of the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009. 24 June has since been designated as a ''Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp'' in Croatia. A monument commemorating those who perished was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990 prior to the outbreak of ethnic violence during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.{{sfn|RTS 29 June 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[German Resistance to Nazism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[The Holocaust]]\n* [[List of books about Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi-German concentration camps]]\n* [[Nazi concentration camps]]\n* [[Nazi Party]]\n* [[Nazi songs]]\n* [[World War II]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Croatia|Genocide|Germany|World War II}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n;Books\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Atkins\n  | first = Stephen E.\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = Holocaust Denial as an International Movement\n  | publisher = Praeger Publishers\n  | location = [[Westport, Connecticut]]\n  | isbn = 978-0-313-34538-8\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=M9Uj6u6b-ZIC&printsec=frontcover\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Balen\n  | first = \u0160ime\n  | year = 1952\n  | title = Paveli\u0107\n  | language = Serbo-Croatian\n  | publisher = Hrvatska selja\u010dka tiskara\n  | location = [[Zagreb]]\n  | oclc = 718318103\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cohen\n  | first = Philip J.\n  | authorlink = Philip J.

concentration camp''' was a [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]] in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) during [[World War II]]. Commanded by Juco Rukavina, it was the first of twenty-six [[concentration camp]]s in the NDH during the war. Established in a secluded area about {{convert|20|km}} from the town of [[Gospi\u0107]], it held thousands of [[Serbs]] and [[Jews]] over a period of 122 days from May to August 1941. Inmates were usually killed by being pushed into deep ravines located near the camp. Estimates of the number of deaths at Jadovno range from 10,000 to 68,000, mostly Serbs. The camp was closed on 21 August 1941, and the area where it was located was later handed over to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and became part of Italian Zones II and III. Jadovno was replaced by the greater sized [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] and its extermination facilities.\n\nThe camp site remained unexplored after the war due to the depth of the gorges where bodies were disposed and the fact that some of them had been filled with [[concrete]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Communist]] authorities. Additional sites containing the skeletal remains of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s. Commemoration ceremonies honouring the victims of the camp have been organized by the [[Serb National Council]] (SNV), the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009, and [[24 June]] has since been designated as a \"Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp\" in Croatia. A monument commemorating those killed in the camp was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Poorly equipped and trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} After the invasion, the extreme [[Croats|Croat]] nationalist and fascist [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\") of an [[Usta\u0161e]]-led Croatian state&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (often called the NDH, from the {{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}).{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} The NDH combined most of modern [[Croatia]], all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of modern [[Serbia]] into an \"Italian-German quasi-protectorate\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} NDH authorities, led by the [[Usta\u0161e militia]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=397\u2013409}} then implemented genocidal policies against the [[Serb]], [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] populations living in the new state.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20\u201324}}\n\nAiming to exterminate the entire Serb population of the NDH,{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=224}} the Usta\u0161e sought to murder one-third of Serbs, convert one-third to [[Roman Catholicism]], and force the rest from the country.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=165}} A series of massacres were committed by the Usta\u0161e, and the degree of cruelty with which the Serb population was persecuted shocked even the Germans.{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=225}}\n\nThe [[Cyrillic script]] was banned, [[Orthodox Christian]] church schools were closed, and Serbs were ordered to wear identifying armbands.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=126}} Similar measures were enacted against Jews, who were required to wear a yellow armband with a black-on-yellow [[Star of David]] for identification. These armbands bore the word \"Jew\" in two languages: [[German language|German]] (\"''Jude''\") and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (\"''\u017didov''\").{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=174}}\n\n===Operation===\nLocated in a secluded area about {{convert|20|km}} from the town of [[Gospi\u0107]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} the Jadovno camp was formed during the early stages of the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution of Serbs]] in the NDH{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} and was placed under the command of the Usta\u0161a [[Juco Rukavina]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Intended as an [[extermination camp]], it was established between 11 and 15 April 1941{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} and was the first of twenty-six [[concentration camp]]s located in the NDH during the war.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=184}}\n\nMost inmates at Usta\u0161e camps&nbsp;\u2013 including Jadovno&nbsp;\u2013 were [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=747}} Other victims included Jews and anti-Usta\u0161e Croats.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Notable Jadovno inmates included the [[Jews in Croatia|Croatian Jewish]] mayor of [[Koprivnica]], [[Ivica Hir\u0161l]],{{sfn|Kraus|1998|p=382}} and the [[Jews in Croatia|Croatian Jewish]] [[Communist]] [[Aleksandar Savi\u0107]].{{sfn|Romano|1980|p=478}}\n\nImmediately, the Usta\u0161e trucked several hundred detainees to a site intended almost exclusively for extermination near [[Gospi\u0107]]. Located on Mount [[Velebit]], the town contained gorges&nbsp;\u2013 some up to {{convert|91.5|m}} deep&nbsp;\u2013 that were used as dumping grounds.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} The Jadovno camp itself was surrounded by such abysses ({{lang-sh|jame}}) which were difficult to gain access to and characteristic of the [[karst]]ic mountain range. The camp itself acted as a \"way station\" en route to these pits.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Here, prisoners had to work the entire day with almost no food until exhaustion.\n\nThe nearest pit to the camp was the \u0160aran pit, located {{convert|1|km}} away, while the pit where inmates were executed and dumped was {{convert|5|km}} from the camp.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}} Here, inmates were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects. Afterwards, an entire row of inmates were pushed into the ravine.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}} In some cases, inmates were also killed by gunfire, as well as with knives and blunt objects. Once inmates were thrown into the ravine, [[hand grenade]]s were hurtled inside in order to kill off the victims. Dogs would also be thrown in to feed on the wounded and the dead.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}} The pits in the vicinity of the camp were filled with the bodies of Jewish and later Serb inmates. However, killings were not confined to these two groups, and the bodies of some Croats and Roma were disposed of in this fashion as well.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}}\n\nBy the end of June, the Usta\u0161e transferred several hundred Jewish families from [[Zagreb]] to Jadovno.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=91}} Afterwards, the camp was visited by Usta\u0161e commander [[Vjekoslav Luburi\u0107]], who opened his visit by cutting the throat of a two-year-old Jewish child. Luburi\u0107 then forced a camp guard to murder and squash the skull of a second child with his foot.{{sfn|Balen|1952|pp=78\u201380}} The last group of inmates at Jadovno were killed with [[machine gun]]s.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}}\n\nThe camp was closed on 21 August 1941, and the remaining Croat inmates were transferred to other NDH-controlled camps, while the remaining Serbs and Jews were murdered.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} Work on the replacement [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] started in the same month. The area in which the Jadovno camp was located was later handed over to the Italians{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=91}} and became part of Italian Zones II and III.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=399}}\n\n=== Italian medical team report ===\nIn September 1941, two Italian army medical teams were sent to investigate reports of mass graves contaminating drinking water across the Velebit mountains and on the island of Pag, all part of the Jadovno system of Usta\u0161e camps and killing pits. This is the Italian medical officer\u2019s description of the Plana pit, located above the village of Bu\u0111ak, on Velebit:<blockquote>In the area around the pit I found pieces of chains, padlocks of various sizes and shapes, railway employee badges, ribbons from trousers of Yugoslav customs officers, toothbrushes, pocket mirrors, combs, and very interestingly, emptied and torn wallets. On one spot I found pieces of a skull for which I believe to belong to an adult person between age 30 and 50, killed approximately two months before. The opening of the pit is 8x5m in size, and it seems to have no bottom. A rock I threw in did not stop, but fell so deeply that I could not hear it hit the bottom. The rim of the pit and its sides were covered with lime that seemed to be used several days before. Despite that the whole area is full of terrible smell of decomposing corpses. It seems that around 500 victims were thrown into this pit.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://jadovno.com/original-documents-of-italian-military-medical-service/#.XoU1ZYhKjIU|title=Charon and Destinies, Original documents of Italian military medical service|last=Zemljar|first=Ante|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://jadovno.com/translation-of-original-italian-documents/#.XoUyeohKjIU|title=Charon and Destinies, Translation of original Italian documents|last=Zemljar|first=Ante|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>The Italian team discovered additional Velebit killing pits - Jamina pit, near Tribnje (\u201chundreds of victims\u201d, including women and children), Jama na Plo\u010dama, near Stupa\u010dinovo (2.000 Serb victims), Duliba jama (200 victims), etc. The team leader notes that due to very difficult terrain and animosity of many locals, they were unable to locate other suspected killing pits. Beyond that, the Italian medical teams investigated the [[Slana concentration camp|Slana]] and Metajna concentration camps on Pag island, part of the same system of Usta\u0161e camps, where there they dug up 791 corpses in mass graves, with nearly half being women and children, and estimated an additional 8 to 9 thousand were killed by the Usta\u0161e in the camps on Pag.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Death toll==\n [[File:Jadovno na Velebitu.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Monument to the victims of the camp.]]\nThe number of deaths at the camp is difficult to establish as many inmates often went unregistered as they were taken directly to the edge of ravines and murdered.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} The highest recorded estimate of Jadovno deaths was made in 1942 by a former inmate of the Gospi\u0107 prison, who claimed that 120,000 people were killed. In 1964, a survey of World War II victims by the War Victim Census Commission showed a figure of 1,794 individual victims in Jadovno. The results of this survey were not published until 1989.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=730}}\n\nThe 1960 edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia]]'' states at least 35,000 were killed in Jadovno, with a possible final death toll of 50,000\u201360,000.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=67}} The 1967 ''Military Encyclopedia'' of Yugoslavia estimates that 72,000 inmates perished in the camp.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} The 1971 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia'' also revised the number to 72,000, which became the most commonly cited estimate in the 1960s and the 1970s.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|pp=730\u201331}} Rev Atanasije Jevti\u0107 stated in 1983 that 80,000 inmates were killed. Historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] said this claim was \"exaggerated\" and not based on any documentation or detailed investigation.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=726}} Historian estimates in the late 1980s and the 1990s mostly ranged from 15,000 to 48,000 victims.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=733}}\n\nA 2007 research study by historian \u0110uro Zatezalo, using 17 archives,{{sfn|Mirkovic|2010}} estimated that the total number of deaths at the camp was 40,123 (38,010 Serbs, 1,998 Jews, 88 Croats and 27 others) and listed the names of 10,502 identified victims, of whom 9,663 were Serbs, 762 Jews, 55 Croats and 22 others.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|pp=730\u201331}} 1,029 children were identified (1,014 Serb and 15 Jewish),{{sfn|Mirkovic|2010}} as was 55 [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priests according to Zatezalo's data. As it operated over a period of 122 days, this would suggest that an average of 329 people were killed there every day.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} Paul Mojzes cites Zatezalos's data.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a 2009 research by the Belgrade Museum of Genocide Victims, between 15,300\u201315,900 people were killed in the Gospi\u0107, Jadovno and Pag camps.{{sfn|Geiger|2011|p=732}} Sources generally offer a range of 10,000\u201368,000 deaths at the camp. Estimates of the number of Jewish deaths range from several hundred{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}} to 2,500\u20132,800.{{sfn|Mojzes|2009|p=160}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nThe Jadovno camp site remained unexplored after the war due to the depth of the gorges where bodies were disposed of and the fact that some of these had been filled with concrete by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Communist]] authorities. Additional sites containing the skeletal remains of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=60}}\n\nCommemoration ceremonies honouring the victims of the camp have been organized by the [[Serb National Council]] (SNV), representatives of the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009. 24 June has since been designated as a ''Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp'' in Croatia. A monument commemorating those who perished was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990 prior to the outbreak of ethnic violence during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.{{sfn|RTS 29 June 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[German Resistance to Nazism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[The Holocaust]]\n* [[List of books about Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi-German concentration camps]]\n* [[Nazi concentration camps]]\n* [[Nazi Party]]\n* [[Nazi songs]]\n* [[World War II]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Croatia|Genocide|Germany|World War II}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n;Books\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Atkins\n  | first = Stephen E.\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = Holocaust Denial as an International Movement\n  | publisher = Praeger Publishers\n  | location = [[Westport, Connecticut]]\n  | isbn = 978-0-313-34538-8\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=M9Uj6u6b-ZIC&printsec=frontcover\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Balen\n  | first = \u0160ime\n  | year = 1952\n  | title = Paveli\u0107\n  | language = Serbo-Croatian\n  | publisher = Hrvatska selja\u010dka tiskara\n  | location = [[Zagreb]]\n  | oclc = 718318103\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cohen\n  | first = Philip J.\n  | authorlink = Philip J.

Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W.

(1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard.

The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]].

The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.
