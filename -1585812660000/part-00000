{"title_page": "List of place names of Spanish origin in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nAs a consequence of former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and, later, [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[sovereignty]] over lands that are now part of the [[United States]], there are many places in the country, mostly in the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]], with names of Spanish origin.  Florida and Louisiana also were at times under Spanish control.  There are also several places in the United States with Spanish names as a result to other factors. Some of these names preserved ancient writing.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Authenticity and origin==\nNot all Spanish place name etymologies in the United States originate from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial period]] or from the Spanish language. Spanish-sounding place names are classified into four categories:\n\n*'''Colonial''': Spanish names that were given during the Spanish colonial period, or adaptations of names originally given in the colonial period to the same place or to nearby related places. ''(Ex: [[Los Angeles, California]])''\n*'''Post-colonial''': Spanish place names that have no history of being used during the colonial period for the place in question or for nearby related places. ''(Ex: [[Lake Buena Vista]], Florida, named in 1969 after a street in [[Burbank, California]])''\n*'''Non-Spanish''': Place names originating from non-Spaniards or in non-historically Spanish areas. ''(Ex: [[Salamanca, New York]], or [[Toledo, Ohio]])''\n*'''Faux''': Fabricated Spanish place names, typically by non-Spanish speakers. ''(Ex: [[Sierra Vista]])''\n\n==States==\n*[[Arizona]] (from one of the following its origin is not certain): the Aztec Indian word \"arizuma,\" that means \"silver-bearing,\" from the Tohono O'odham Indian word \"Aleh-zone\" which means \"small spring,\" or the Pima Indian word \"Ali shonak\" which also means \"small spring.\n*[[California]] (from the name of a fictional island country in ''[[Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n]]'', a popular Spanish [[chivalric romance]] by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo) \n*[[Colorado]] (meaning \"red [colored]\", \"ruddy\" or \"colored\" in masculine form. Named after Colorado City; now called [[Old Colorado City]].)\n*[[Florida]] Meaning \"\"Flowery\" or \"Florid\", because it was discovered by [[Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] on [[Easter Sunday]], called ''Pascua Florida'' to distinguish this holiday, which occurs in [[spring (season)|springtime]] when [[flowers]] are abundant, from other Christian holidays called ''Pascua'' in Spanish, such as [[Christmas]] and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n*[[Montana]] from Latinized Spanish meaning \"mountainous\", also in Spanish \"monta\u00f1a\" is the name of \"mountain\" \n*[[Nevada]] comes from the Spanish Sierra Nevada (which is also a mountain range in Spain), meaning snowy mountain range (Nevada is the Spanish feminine form of snowy).\n*[[New Mexico]] (Calqued from ''Nuevo [[Mexico|M\u00e9xico]]'')\n*[[Texas]] (based on the [[Caddo language|Caddo]] word ''teshas'', meaning \"friends\" or \"allies\", which was applied by the Spanish to the [[Caddo]] themselves and to the region of their settlement in [[East Texas]]).  The letter [[x]] had a \"sh\" sound in [[Old Spanish language|16th-century Spanish]] which gradually evolved to an \"h\" sound, which under later spelling reforms was assigned to the letter [[j]] (which originally also had a \"zh\", \"j\" or \"y\" sound)  Thus the modern Spanish spelling ''Tejas'', which sounds like \"Tehas\".\n*[[Utah]] (Spanish word of [[Nahuatl]] origin, first used by friar Ger\u00f3nimo Salmer\u00f3n as Yuta or Uta in Spanish<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.utefans.net/home/ancient_ute/utetribe.html |title=What is a Ute? |access-date=2011-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120806/http://www.utefans.net/home/ancient_ute/utetribe.html |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>)\n\n==Territories==\n*[[Northern Mariana Islands|North Mariana Islands]] (after [[Mariana of Austria|queen Mariana]], regent at the time)\n*[[Puerto Rico]] (Spanish for \"Rich Port\")\n* [[US Virgin Islands]] ([[Christopher Columbus]] named the [[Virgin Islands]] after ''[[Saint Ursula|Santa Ursula]] y las Once mil Virgenes'' (English: St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins), shortened to ''las V\u00edrgenes'' (the Virgins))\n\n==Counties and parishes==\n\n*[[Alameda County, California]] (\"Boulevard with Poplars\")\n*[[Alamosa County, Colorado]] (\"Shaded with Poplars or Cottonwoods\")\n*[[Amador County, California]] (named for Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Amador, ''amador'' is a Spanish word for \"lover\", not widely used)\n*[[Angelina County, Texas]] (From \"\u00c1ngelina,\" a Spanish given name.

It was renamed '''Airlines 400''' in 2001, before adopting its current name in 2007.\n\nThe airline was owned by Russian tycoon [[Alexander Lebedev]], who wanted to create a discount airline using modern Russian [[Tupolev Tu-204|Tupolev Tu-204-100B]] 210-passenger twin-jet airliners, both newly-built and used. The company had a fleet of ten Tu-204-100Bs (an eleventh Tu-204 was written off after crashing at [[Vnukovo International Airport]] on 29 December 2012), and had also sought to acquire [[Airbus A320]]s and possibly [[Airbus A321]]s to complement its Tu-204 fleet.<ref>\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/21/315031/red-wings-considers-a321s-as-suitable-a320s-prove-elusive.html Red Wings considers A321s as suitable A320s prove elusive]\", [[Flight International]], Retrieved 24 August 2008</ref>\n\nLebedev also owned 49% of [[Germany|German]] [[charter airline]] [[Blue Wings]], which was to become Red Wings's sister company.

It was renamed '''Airlines 400''' in 2001, before adopting its current name in 2007.\n\nThe airline was owned by Russian tycoon [[Alexander Lebedev]], who wanted to create a discount airline using modern Russian [[Tupolev Tu-204|Tupolev Tu-204-100B]] 210-passenger twin-jet airliners, both newly-built and used. The company had a fleet of ten Tu-204-100Bs (an eleventh Tu-204 was written off after crashing at [[Vnukovo International Airport]] on 29 December 2012), and had also sought to acquire [[Airbus A320]]s and possibly [[Airbus A321]]s to complement its Tu-204 fleet.<ref>\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/21/315031/red-wings-considers-a321s-as-suitable-a320s-prove-elusive.html Red Wings considers A321s as suitable A320s prove elusive]\", [[Flight International]], Retrieved 24 August 2008</ref>\n\nLebedev also owned 49% of [[Germany|German]] [[charter airline]] [[Blue Wings]], which was to become Red Wings's sister company.

He looks at his watch, says he is tired, and leaves. The next night he makes a feeble excuse for not seeing her. A friend drives Meadow to Jackie's place. He comes out with another girl. Meadow gets out of the car and tells him they are finished. She and her friend then drive away, the other girl walks off, and Jackie is left alone.\n\n[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Gloria Trillo|Gloria]] comes back from [[Morocco]] and goes to meet [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] on his boat. She picks a quarrel and storms out, leaving him baffled. They reconcile, and have lunchtime sex in a hotel. She invites him for dinner in her house that night but, delayed by family obligations, he arrives very late. She is bitterly hurt and angry, but they reconcile again and have sex, and she cooks dinner again. Then, just before eating, he receives a phone call and has to leave on urgent business. She says, \"I hate you!\", throws his dinner\u2014a steak\u2014at him, and trashes her dining room after he goes.\n\nTony tells [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] that he is seeing Gloria. In the first session he speaks of how happy they are together; in the second he complains of her changing moods. Melfi says Gloria is depressive, unstable, and impossible to please. \"Does that remind you of any other woman?\"\n\nTony instructs [[Paulie Walnuts|Paulie]] to make a collection from [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Valery|Valery]], a Russian, on behalf of [[Silvio Dante|Silvio]], who is ill. He goes there with [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]]. Though it is early, Valery is drunk. Paulie needlessly provokes him and there is a fight. Though drunk, Valery fights skilfully but the other two get on top of him and Paulie throttles him with a floor lamp. Shocked at what they have done, they wrap him in a carpet and wheel him out to their car. Paulie suggests that they dump him somewhere in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]]. He calls Tony but this call and others later are hampered by poor reception and static. [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Slava Malevsky|Slava]], who launders Tony's money, tells him that he and Valery, a trained commando, are closer than brothers.\n\nIn the snow-covered woods, Paulie and Chris park and open the trunk: Valery is still alive. They walk him some distance, give him a shovel, and make him dig his own grave. Choosing his moment, Valery hits them both hard with the shovel and flees. They chase him, shooting. Paulie thinks he has shot him in the head but he keeps running, and goes out of sight. They find his track, but it suddenly ends: Valery has vanished.\n\nAfter a time, Paulie and Chris realize they are lost. Paulie slips down a slope and loses a shoe. Long after nightfall, faint with cold and hunger, they find an abandoned van where they take refuge. Light-headed, they blame each other for what has happened; Chris says Paulie intends to choke him while he is asleep. They fight, Chris pulls a gun on Paulie, then breaks down in crazy laughter. They agree to stay together.\n\nIn the middle of the night Paulie calls Tony (who receives the call in Gloria's house), manages to tell him where they parked the car, and pleads for help. Tony drives out with [[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby]], a skilled [[outdoorsman]]. They reach the parking-spot: Paulie's car has vanished. They wait until dawn to look for Paulie and Chris, who have left the van and are walking in a random direction. Paulie's makeshift shoe falls off, and he shoots it in a fit of crazed frustration. Tony and Bobby hear the shots and head toward their source; the pairs soon meet up with one another.\n\nPaulie gives a false version of what caused the fight with Valery, and Chris backs him up.  The money they collected was in the car. Tony stresses to Paulie that if Valery ever turns up again, it will be his responsibility. They head back to north Jersey in silence; only Bobby has peace of mind.\n\n==Valery's fate==\nFans and reviewers speculated about the fate of the Russian gangster Valery. Shortly after he escapes from Paulie and Christopher in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]], Paulie hits Valery with a bullet, apparently in the head. But the pair cannot track down the Russian. The camera shifts away from Paulie and Christopher, showing a viewpoint looking down from above the two gangsters, suggesting that Valery was watching them from high up in a tree. In addition, Paulie's car is missing when they return.  Valery was never seen again. Series creator [[David Chase]] has said that he never intended to have Valery return, and believed that the story is richer and more realistic with some mystery to the plot. [[HBO]] listed Valery as \"Deceased?\" in promotional materials.\n\nOn the fate of Valery, Terence Winter said:\n{{bquote|That's the question I get asked more than any other. It drives people crazy: \"Where's the Russian? What happened to the Russian?\" We could say, \"Well, he got out and there's a big mob war with the Russians,\" or \"He crawled off and died.\" But we wanted to keep it ambiguous. You know, not everything gets answered in life.<ref name=\"ew\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038366_3,00.html EW.com: Chase 'n' the Russian]</ref>}}\n\nDavid Chase said:\n{{bquote|They shot a guy. Who knows where he went? Who cares about some Russian? This is what Hollywood has done to America. Do you have to have closure on every little thing? Isn't there any mystery in the world? It's a murky world out there. It's a murky life these guys lead. And by the way, I do know where the Russian is. But I'll never say because so many people got so pissy about it.<ref name=\"ew\"/>|}}\n\nIn 2008 Chase said in an interview at the [[Screen Actors Guild|Actors Guild]]:\n{{bquote|OK, this is what happened. Some Boy Scouts found the Russian, who had the telephone number to his boss, Slava, in his pocket. They called Slava, who took him to the hospital where he had brain surgery.

People came to me...He never went up a tree...He collapsed and he was found by some boy scouts.  And they got in touch with his...somehow he was carrying a piece of I.D., which led them back to his boss. Slava the Russian guy.

Tony's response and laughter, pointing at Bobby and then doubling over the sink, is the take of Gandolfini seeing the strap-on.\n\n==Music==\n* The song played during the opening scene, where Gloria arrives at the docks, is [[Them (band)|Them]]'s \"[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]\".\n* The music video A.J. is watching on the living room television is \"[[Coffee & TV]]\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]].\n* The song played during the final montage/closing credits is the [[aria]] \"[[Sposa son disprezzata]]\" (\"I am wife and I am scorned\") from the opera ''[[Merope (Giacomelli)|La Merope]]'' by [[Geminiano Giacomelli]], sung by [[Cecilia Bartoli]].

Tony and Bobby hear the shots and head toward their source; the pairs soon meet up with one another.\n\nPaulie gives a false version of what caused the fight with Valery, and Chris backs him up.  The money they collected was in the car. Tony stresses to Paulie that if Valery ever turns up again, it will be his responsibility. They head back to north Jersey in silence; only Bobby has peace of mind.\n\n==Valery's fate==\nFans and reviewers speculated about the fate of the Russian gangster Valery. Shortly after he escapes from Paulie and Christopher in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]], Paulie hits Valery with a bullet, apparently in the head. But the pair cannot track down the Russian. The camera shifts away from Paulie and Christopher, showing a viewpoint looking down from above the two gangsters, suggesting that Valery was watching them from high up in a tree. In addition, Paulie's car is missing when they return.  Valery was never seen again. Series creator [[David Chase]] has said that he never intended to have Valery return, and believed that the story is richer and more realistic with some mystery to the plot. [[HBO]] listed Valery as \"Deceased?\" in promotional materials.\n\nOn the fate of Valery, Terence Winter said:\n{{bquote|That's the question I get asked more than any other. It drives people crazy: \"Where's the Russian? What happened to the Russian?\" We could say, \"Well, he got out and there's a big mob war with the Russians,\" or \"He crawled off and died.\" But we wanted to keep it ambiguous. You know, not everything gets answered in life.<ref name=\"ew\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038366_3,00.html EW.com: Chase 'n' the Russian]</ref>}}\n\nDavid Chase said:\n{{bquote|They shot a guy.

All of the vampires possess [[supernatural]] powers, including [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|transform into animals]]. Viago is a 379-year-old [[dandy]] from the 18th century, who originally traveled to [[New Zealand]] in the 1910s in search of the love of his life Katherine; Vladislav is an 862-year-old known as \"[[Vlad the Impaler|Vladislav the Poker]]\", who is haunted by memories of his nemesis \"the Beast\"; and Deacon is a 183-year-old former [[Nazi]] and the \"young rebel\" of the group who was bitten by Petyr\u2014a reclusive, 8,000-year-old vampire who behaves like a [[feral]] animal.\n\nEach night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon take the bus into town and prowl the streets of Wellington for people to kill. Deacon's human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], Jackie, runs errands for the vampires and cleans up the gore left behind by their feeding. A married mother, Jackie hopes to attain immortality\u2014but is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as promised. Deacon requests that Jackie bring [[virginity|virgins]] to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in [[primary school]] and Nick, her ex-boyfriend from childhood, to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is attacked by Petyr. Nick survives the attack and becomes a vampire.\n\nTwo months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu\u2014a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology such as the [[Internet]] and cameras. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip. Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick's newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a [[vampire hunter]], breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight.\n\nThe vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check. The police, whom Viago [[Hypnosis|hypnotises]], warn the vampires about numerous fire hazards inside the flat. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases.\n\nSeveral months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual [[masquerade ball|Unholy Masquerade]], hosted for the local undead population of vampires, [[zombie]]s, and [[witchcraft|witches]]. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that \"the Beast\" will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. \"The Beast\" is revealed to be Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Pauline's new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of [[werewolves]] who transform under the full moon. One cameraman is [[disembowelment|disemboweled]] by a werewolf, and Stu is viciously mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him.\n\nAfter a few days, Nick returns to the flat with Stu and the werewolves. Stu reveals that he survived the attack and transformed to a werewolf that night. With Stu's urging, the pack is allowed to visit the flat and reconciles with the vampires\u2014and Nick's banishment is rescinded. Viago also reconnects with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire and rekindles his romance with. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline and Jackie has made her husband her familiar.

All of the vampires possess [[supernatural]] powers, including [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|transform into animals]]. Viago is a 379-year-old [[dandy]] from the 18th century, who originally traveled to [[New Zealand]] in the 1910s in search of the love of his life Katherine; Vladislav is an 862-year-old known as \"[[Vlad the Impaler|Vladislav the Poker]]\", who is haunted by memories of his nemesis \"the Beast\"; and Deacon is a 183-year-old former [[Nazi]] and the \"young rebel\" of the group who was bitten by Petyr\u2014a reclusive, 8,000-year-old vampire who behaves like a [[feral]] animal.\n\nEach night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon take the bus into town and prowl the streets of Wellington for people to kill. Deacon's human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], Jackie, runs errands for the vampires and cleans up the gore left behind by their feeding. A married mother, Jackie hopes to attain immortality\u2014but is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as promised. Deacon requests that Jackie bring [[virginity|virgins]] to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in [[primary school]] and Nick, her ex-boyfriend from childhood, to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is attacked by Petyr. Nick survives the attack and becomes a vampire.\n\nTwo months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu\u2014a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology such as the [[Internet]] and cameras. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip. Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick's newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a [[vampire hunter]], breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight.\n\nThe vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check. The police, whom Viago [[Hypnosis|hypnotises]], warn the vampires about numerous fire hazards inside the flat. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases.\n\nSeveral months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual [[masquerade ball|Unholy Masquerade]], hosted for the local undead population of vampires, [[zombie]]s, and [[witchcraft|witches]]. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that \"the Beast\" will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. \"The Beast\" is revealed to be Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Pauline's new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of [[werewolves]] who transform under the full moon. One cameraman is [[disembowelment|disemboweled]] by a werewolf, and Stu is viciously mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him.\n\nAfter a few days, Nick returns to the flat with Stu and the werewolves. Stu reveals that he survived the attack and transformed to a werewolf that night. With Stu's urging, the pack is allowed to visit the flat and reconciles with the vampires\u2014and Nick's banishment is rescinded. Viago also reconnects with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire and rekindles his romance with. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline and Jackie has made her husband her familiar. A [[post-credits scene]] shows Deacon attempting to hypnotise the audience to forget the events of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as Viago Von Dorna Schmarten Scheden Heimburg (n\u00e9 von Blitzenberg), aged 379 \u2013 an uptight member of the household.
