It is often claimed that Jagger took inspiration from novelist [[James Joyce]]'s 1922 book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', taking the excerpt \"I have to turn my head until my darkness goes\", referring to the novel's theme of a worldwide view of desperation and desolation.<ref name=before>{{cite book |title=1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die |url=http://www.listology.com/thisisentertainment/list/1001-songs-you-must-hear-you-die |page=175 |year=2014 |edition=4th |publisher=Universe Publishing |location=New York, NY |author=Visconti, Tony |isbn=9780789320896}}</ref> The song itself came to fruition when the band's leader [[Brian Jones]] took an interest in Moroccan music. It was their first song to feature a sitar instrumental.\n\n\"Paint It Black\" came at a pivotal period in the Rolling Stones' recording history, a time that saw the [[Jagger/Richards|songwriting collaboration]] of Jagger and [[Keith Richards|Richards]] assert itself as the principal composer of the band's original material. This is evident from the sessions for the album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'', where for the first time the duo penned the complete track list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/aftermath-uk/ |title=''Aftermath'' (UK) |publisher=rollingstones.com |accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> In addition, Jones, overshadowed by Jagger and Richards, grew bored with attempting to write songs, as well as conventional guitar melodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/ |title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|author=Wawzenek, Bryan|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> To alleviate the boredom, Jones explored eastern instruments, more specifically the [[sitar]], to bolster the group's musical texture and complexity. A multi-instrumentalist, Jones was able to develop a tune from the sitar in a short amount of time; Jones had a background with the instrument as far back as 1961, largely due to his studies under [[Harihar Rao]], a disciple of [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name=strange>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6KRDxYOp4UC&pg=PT154&dq=the+rolling+stones+paint+it+black&hl=en&sa=X&ei=W5drVbQVhpLJBKiUgbAI&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=the%20rolling%20stones%20paint%20it%20black&f=false |title=Strange Sounds: Offbeat Instruments and Sonic Experiments in Pop|author=Brend, Mark |pages=151\u201352 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco, CA |edition=1st |year=2005 |isbn=9780879308551}}</ref> Not long after a discussion with [[George Harrison]], who had recently recorded sitar on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\", Jones arranged basic melodies with the instrument that, over time, morphed into the one featured in \"Paint It Black\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5Dh_Owq0agC&pg=PA92&dq=paint+it+black+song&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L7NrVf-0DYq5yQTOxIP4Ag&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=paint%20it%20black%20song&f=false |title=The Album |author=Perone, James E. |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |page=92 |isbn=9780313379062}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1995 interview, when commenting on the musical styles found on ''Aftermath'', Jagger described \"Paint It Black\" as a \"kind of Turkish song\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jannswenner.com/Archives/Jagger_Remembers.aspx |title=Jann S.

However, while twiddling with a [[Hammond organ]], [[Bill Wyman]] searched for a heavier [[bass guitar|bass]] sound, while playing the part on his knees. Wyman's playing clicked with the group, and inspired the up-tempo and Eastern pentatonic melody. By all accounts, the sitar was brought into the mix when Harihar Rao happened to walk in the studio with the instrument in hand.<ref name=track />\n\nThe sitar was featured in the song. In his book ''Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones'', [[Paul Trynka]] has noted that the influence of Harrison's sitar playing, and, in particular, [[the Beatles]]' song \"Norwegian Wood\" on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album, draws parallels in \"Paint It Black\"\u2014most noticeably in Jones' droning sitar melody.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones|author=Trynka, Paul|date=2014|publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York, New York|edition=1st|isbn=9781101614723}}</ref> In response to claims that he was merely imitating the Beatles, however, Jones said: \"What utter rubbish!\" His sitar part on the track immediately became influential in developing a whole subgenre of minor-key [[psychedelic music]].<ref name=strange /> Coupled with this striking instrumental [[motif (music)|motif]], it is complemented by Jagger's droning, and slight nasal [[vocals|vocalization]].<ref name=before /> In addition, \"Paint It Black\" was highlighted by Wyman's heavy bass, [[Charlie Watts]]'s low-pitch [[drums|drumming]], and Richards' [[bolero]]-driven [[acoustic guitar]] outro.

It is often claimed that Jagger took inspiration from novelist [[James Joyce]]'s 1922 book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', taking the excerpt \"I have to turn my head until my darkness goes\", referring to the novel's theme of a worldwide view of desperation and desolation.<ref name=before>{{cite book |title=1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die |url=http://www.listology.com/thisisentertainment/list/1001-songs-you-must-hear-you-die |page=175 |year=2014 |edition=4th |publisher=Universe Publishing |location=New York, NY |author=Visconti, Tony |isbn=9780789320896}}</ref> The song itself came to fruition when the band's leader [[Brian Jones]] took an interest in Moroccan music. It was their first song to feature a sitar instrumental.\n\n\"Paint It Black\" came at a pivotal period in the Rolling Stones' recording history, a time that saw the [[Jagger/Richards|songwriting collaboration]] of Jagger and [[Keith Richards|Richards]] assert itself as the principal composer of the band's original material. This is evident from the sessions for the album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'', where for the first time the duo penned the complete track list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/aftermath-uk/ |title=''Aftermath'' (UK) |publisher=rollingstones.com |accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> In addition, Jones, overshadowed by Jagger and Richards, grew bored with attempting to write songs, as well as conventional guitar melodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/ |title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|author=Wawzenek, Bryan|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> To alleviate the boredom, Jones explored eastern instruments, more specifically the [[sitar]], to bolster the group's musical texture and complexity. A multi-instrumentalist, Jones was able to develop a tune from the sitar in a short amount of time; Jones had a background with the instrument as far back as 1961, largely due to his studies under [[Harihar Rao]], a disciple of [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name=strange>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6KRDxYOp4UC&pg=PT154&dq=the+rolling+stones+paint+it+black&hl=en&sa=X&ei=W5drVbQVhpLJBKiUgbAI&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=the%20rolling%20stones%20paint%20it%20black&f=false |title=Strange Sounds: Offbeat Instruments and Sonic Experiments in Pop|author=Brend, Mark |pages=151\u201352 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco, CA |edition=1st |year=2005 |isbn=9780879308551}}</ref> Not long after a discussion with [[George Harrison]], who had recently recorded sitar on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\", Jones arranged basic melodies with the instrument that, over time, morphed into the one featured in \"Paint It Black\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5Dh_Owq0agC&pg=PA92&dq=paint+it+black+song&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L7NrVf-0DYq5yQTOxIP4Ag&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=paint%20it%20black%20song&f=false |title=The Album |author=Perone, James E. |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |page=92 |isbn=9780313379062}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1995 interview, when commenting on the musical styles found on ''Aftermath'', Jagger described \"Paint It Black\" as a \"kind of Turkish song\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jannswenner.com/Archives/Jagger_Remembers.aspx |title=Jann S.

However, while twiddling with a [[Hammond organ]], [[Bill Wyman]] searched for a heavier [[bass guitar|bass]] sound, while playing the part on his knees. Wyman's playing clicked with the group, and inspired the up-tempo and Eastern pentatonic melody.

In his book ''Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones'', [[Paul Trynka]] has noted that the influence of Harrison's sitar playing, and, in particular, [[the Beatles]]' song \"Norwegian Wood\" on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album, draws parallels in \"Paint It Black\"\u2014most noticeably in Jones' droning sitar melody.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones|author=Trynka, Paul|date=2014|publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York, New York|edition=1st|isbn=9781101614723}}</ref> In response to claims that he was merely imitating the Beatles, however, Jones said: \"What utter rubbish!\" His sitar part on the track immediately became influential in developing a whole subgenre of minor-key [[psychedelic music]].<ref name=strange /> Coupled with this striking instrumental [[motif (music)|motif]], it is complemented by Jagger's droning, and slight nasal [[vocals|vocalization]].<ref name=before /> In addition, \"Paint It Black\" was highlighted by Wyman's heavy bass, [[Charlie Watts]]'s low-pitch [[drums|drumming]], and Richards' [[bolero]]-driven [[acoustic guitar]] outro.
