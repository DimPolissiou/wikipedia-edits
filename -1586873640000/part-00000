From the start, there was a complete rapport between father and daughter, who needed little encouragement to become a [[tomboy]].<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 7.</ref>\n\nAt the family stables Krystyna met [[Andrzej Kowerski]], whose father had brought him over to play with ten-year-old Krystyna while he and her father discussed agricultural matters.<ref>M.

Masson, ''Christine'', p. 17.</ref> In 1930, when Krystyna was 22, Count Jerzy died. The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 1930, Krystyna married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour. A subsequent love affair came to naught when the young man's mother refused to consider the penniless divorc\u00e9e as a potential daughter-in-law.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nOne day, on a Zakopane ski slope, Krystyna lost control and was saved by a giant of a man who stepped into her path and stopped her descent.  Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there.<ref name=\"Christine p. 24\">M.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.  She was described as a \"flaming Polish patriot, expert skier, and great adventuress\" and \"absolutely fearless.\"<ref>Mulley, p. 32-33</ref><ref>M.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could scarcely believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could scarcely believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs. He is now in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [\u2026]. I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.
