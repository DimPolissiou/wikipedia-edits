Harrah's Operating Co.]]'' when the Ninth Circuit en banc ruled that a casino can require female workers to wear makeup.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, Fletcher wrote a 101 page dissent when the 9th circuit permitted the execution of Kevin Cooper to go forward. Fletcher noted that Cooper may have been innocent and was denied a fair trial. Fletcher also reasoned that Cooper may have been treated unfairly due to his race. He was joined by Judges [[Harry Pregerson]], [[Stephen Reinhardt]], [[Richard Paez]], and [[Johnnie B. Rawlinson]]. 6 other judges also dissented in denial of rehearing and agreed or mostly agreed with Fletcher's reasoning: [[Alex Kozinski]], [[Sidney Runyan Thomas]], [[Susan P. Graber]], [[Raymond C.

Fletcher wrote: \"We hold that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the Arizona law imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/14-15624/14-15624-2014-06-03.html|title=Planned Parenthood Arizona v.

San Diego County]]'', ruling that the Second Amendment did not protect the right to carry a concealed weapon. The San Diego ban on concealed weapons was upheld by a vote of 7\u20134.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, in a reluctant concurrence in a case where the 9th circuit permitted Trump to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for immigration proceedings in court, Fletcher said of the Trump administration \"I am hopeful that the regular argument panel that will ultimately hear the appeal, with the benefit of full briefing and regularly scheduled argument, will be able to see the Government's arguments for what they are -- baseless arguments in support of an illegal policy that will, if sustained, require bona fide asylum applicants to wait in Mexico for years while their applications are adjudicated.\"  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/ninth_circuit/2019/05/trump-wins-round-in-immigrant-policy----asylum-seekers-must-go-home.html|title=Trump Wins Round in Immigrant Policy -- Asylum-Seekers Must Go Home|website=Findlaw}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, Fletcher dissented when the Ninth Circuit upheld Trump's gag rule restricting abortion funding by a vote of 7\u20134.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveaction.org/news/ninth-circuit-abortion-businesses-titlex-rule-defund/ |title=Abortion businesses 'devastated' as Title X rule to defund goes into effect |publisher=Liveaction.org |date=2019-07-16 |accessdate=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2019, Fletcher ruled that an animal does not constitute an \"individual\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/08/12/18-16327.pdf |title=Court documents |date=August 12, 2019 |website=cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov |format=PDF |access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn August 15, 2019, Fletcher was in a 3\u20130 majority that ruled that detained migrant children must get sleep, soap, and clean water.

[[Morgan Christen]] concurred, noting that Vega-Anguiano could not have known that he needed to bring these errors to the agency's attention. [[Consuelo Callahan]] would have denied relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/11/19/15-72999.pdf |title=No. 15-72999 |website=United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit |date=November 19, 2019 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOn December 24, 2019, Fletcher concurred in a ruling against police immunity. However, he criticized the Supreme Court's 1995 case Johnson v. Jones, writing\n\"I hope that the Supreme Court will revisit the issue soon and will disavow Johnson entirely. But until that happens, I believe that we are, unfortunately, bound to follow what remains of Johnson.\" <ref>http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/12/24/18-15665.pdf</ref>\n\nOn January 27, 2020, Fletcher wrote for the majority (in a 7-4 decision) that Arizona's policy of not counting ballots filed in the wrong precinct is unconstitutional under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Fletcher also ruled that Arizona had not carried its burden of showing that racial discrimination was not a factor in the making of this policy. Fletcher used maps to show why voters of Native American and Hispanic descent were far more likely to file a ballot at the wrong precinct, whether intentional (for convenience) or not. Fletcher also explained the longtime history of racial discrimination in Arizona.<ref>http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/01/27/18-15845.pdf</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2020, Fletcher, who was joined by Paez, ruled that asylum seekers could not be forced to be wait in Mexico while their hearings proceeded, mentioning that court proceedings often take years. However, on March 4, Fletcher and Paez narrowed the ruling to California and Arizona, letting the Supreme Court decide the rest.<ref>https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/02/28/19-15716.pdf</ref><ref>https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/03/04/19-15716_order.pdf</ref> However, the Supreme Court reversed Fletcher's ruling on March 11, allowing Trump's \"Remain-in-Mexico\" policy to continue. <ref>https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/487054-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-enforce-remain-in-mexico-policy</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{FJC Bio|nid=1390781}}\n*{{C-SPAN|William Fletcher}}\n\n{{USCourtsOfAppealsJudges}}\n{{Portal bar|Biography}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fletcher, William A.}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:American Rhodes Scholars]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]\n[[Category:Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Lawyers from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:United States court of appeals judges appointed by Bill Clinton]]\n[[Category:United States Navy officers]]\n[[Category:UC Berkeley School of Law faculty]]\n[[Category:Yale Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century American judges]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|American judge}}\n{{For|the Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court|William A.

Harrah's Operating Co.]]'' when the Ninth Circuit en banc ruled that a casino can require female workers to wear makeup.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, Fletcher wrote a 101 page dissent when the 9th circuit permitted the execution of Kevin Cooper to go forward. Fletcher noted that Cooper may have been innocent and was denied a fair trial. Fletcher also reasoned that Cooper may have been treated unfairly due to his race. He was joined by Judges [[Harry Pregerson]], [[Stephen Reinhardt]], [[Richard Paez]], and [[Johnnie B. Rawlinson]]. 6 other judges also dissented in denial of rehearing and agreed or mostly agreed with Fletcher's reasoning: [[Alex Kozinski]], [[Sidney Runyan Thomas]], [[Susan P. Graber]], [[Raymond C. Fisher]], [[Marsha S.

Fletcher wrote: \"We hold that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the Arizona law imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/14-15624/14-15624-2014-06-03.html|title=Planned Parenthood Arizona v.

San Diego County]]'', ruling that the Second Amendment did not protect the right to carry a concealed weapon. The San Diego ban on concealed weapons was upheld by a vote of 7\u20134.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, in a reluctant concurrence in a case where the 9th circuit permitted Trump to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for immigration proceedings in court, Fletcher said of the Trump administration \"I am hopeful that the regular argument panel that will ultimately hear the appeal, with the benefit of full briefing and regularly scheduled argument, will be able to see the Government's arguments for what they are -- baseless arguments in support of an illegal policy that will, if sustained, require bona fide asylum applicants to wait in Mexico for years while their applications are adjudicated.\"  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/ninth_circuit/2019/05/trump-wins-round-in-immigrant-policy----asylum-seekers-must-go-home.html|title=Trump Wins Round in Immigrant Policy -- Asylum-Seekers Must Go Home|website=Findlaw}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, Fletcher dissented when the Ninth Circuit upheld Trump's gag rule restricting abortion funding by a vote of 7\u20134.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveaction.org/news/ninth-circuit-abortion-businesses-titlex-rule-defund/ |title=Abortion businesses 'devastated' as Title X rule to defund goes into effect |publisher=Liveaction.org |date=2019-07-16 |accessdate=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2019, Fletcher ruled that an animal does not constitute an \"individual\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/08/12/18-16327.pdf |title=Court documents |date=August 12, 2019 |website=cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov |format=PDF |access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn August 15, 2019, Fletcher was in a 3\u20130 majority that ruled that detained migrant children must get sleep, soap, and clean water.

[[Morgan Christen]] concurred, noting that Vega-Anguiano could not have known that he needed to bring these errors to the agency's attention. [[Consuelo Callahan]] would have denied relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/11/19/15-72999.pdf |title=No. 15-72999 |website=United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit |date=November 19, 2019 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOn December 24, 2019, Fletcher concurred in a ruling against police immunity. However, he criticized the Supreme Court's 1995 case Johnson v. Jones, writing\n\"I hope that the Supreme Court will revisit the issue soon and will disavow Johnson entirely.

Fletcher also ruled that Arizona had not carried its burden of showing that racial discrimination was not a factor in the making of this policy. Fletcher used maps to show why voters of Native American and Hispanic descent were far more likely to file a ballot at the wrong precinct, whether intentional (for convenience) or not. Fletcher also explained the longtime history of racial discrimination in Arizona.<ref>http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/01/27/18-15845.pdf</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2020, Fletcher, who was joined by Paez, ruled that asylum seekers could not be forced to be wait in Mexico while their hearings proceeded, mentioning that court proceedings often take years. However, on March 4, Fletcher and Paez narrowed the ruling to California and Arizona, letting the Supreme Court decide the rest.<ref>https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/02/28/19-15716.pdf</ref><ref>https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/03/04/19-15716_order.pdf</ref> However, the Supreme Court reversed Fletcher's ruling on March 11, allowing Trump's \"Remain-in-Mexico\" policy to continue. <ref>https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/487054-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-enforce-remain-in-mexico-policy</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{FJC Bio|nid=1390781}}\n*{{C-SPAN|William Fletcher}}\n\n{{USCourtsOfAppealsJudges}}\n{{Portal bar|Biography}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fletcher, William A.}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:American Rhodes Scholars]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]\n[[Category:Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Lawyers from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:United States court of appeals judges appointed by Bill Clinton]]\n[[Category:United States Navy officers]]\n[[Category:UC Berkeley School of Law faculty]]\n[[Category:Yale Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century American judges]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Fletcher"}
