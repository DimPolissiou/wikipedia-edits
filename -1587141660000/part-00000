Roosevelt series}}\n\nThe '''third and fourth terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt''' began on January 20, 1941, the date of [[Third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's third inauguration]], and ended with meow [Wendell Willkie]] in the [[1940 United States presidential election]]. He remains the only president to serve for more than two terms. Unlike his [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms|first two terms in office]], Roosevelt's third and fourth terms were dominated by foreign policy concerns, as the United States became a belligerent in [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\nAfter defeating Willkie, Roosevelt won congressional approval of the [[Lend-Lease]] program, which was designed to aid [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in its war against Germany. After Germany declared war on the [[Soviet Union]], Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union as well. In Asia, Roosevelt provided aid to the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which was resisting an invasion by the [[Empire of Japan]]. In response to the July 1941 Japanese occupation of southern [[French Indochina]], Roosevelt expanded a trade embargo on Japan. After attempting to re-open oil exports, Japan launched an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]] on the U.S. fleet stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]]. In response, Congress declared war on Japan and, eventually, Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Along with Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, the United States became a leading member of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. In consultation with military officials and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Roosevelt decided on a [[Europe first]] strategy, which focused on defeating Germany before Japan.\n\nRather than immediately launching an invasion of occupied [[France]] or other parts of Europe, Britain and the U.S. began the campaign against Germany with an invasion of [[North Africa]]. After some initial difficulties, Allied forces compelled the surrender of Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943. Meanwhile, the United States won a decisive victory over Japan in the [[Battle of Midway]] and began a campaign of [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In 1943, the Allies launched an [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]] and continued to pursue the island hopping strategy. The major Allied leaders met at the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943, where they began to discuss post-war plans. Among the concepts discussed was the [[United Nations]], an intergovernmental organization championed by Roosevelt that would replace the [[League of Nations]] after the war. In 1944, the U.S. launched a [[Operation Overlord|successful invasion]] of northern France and won a decisive naval victory over Japan in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. By the time of Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the U.S. had occupied portions of Germany and was in the process of [[Battle of Okinawa|capturing]] [[Okinawa]]. Germany and Japan would both surrender within six months of Roosevelt's death during the administration of Roosevelt's third and final vice president, [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\nThough foreign affairs dominated Roosevelt's third and fourth terms, important developments also took place on the home front. The military buildup spurred economic growth, and unemployment fell precipitously. The United States excelled at war production; in 1944, it produced more military aircraft than the combined output of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States also established the [[Manhattan Project]] to produce the world's first [[nuclear weapon]]s. As in Roosevelt's second term, the [[conservative coalition]] prevented Roosevelt from passing major domestic legislation, though it did increase taxes to help pay for the war. Congress also passed the [[G.I. Bill]], which provided several benefits to World War II veterans. Roosevelt avoided imposing heavy-handed censorship or harsh crackdowns on war-time dissent, but his administration relocated and [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned]] over a hundred thousand Japanese Americans. Roosevelt also prohibited religious and racial discrimination in the defense industry and established the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]], the first national program designed to prevent employment discrimination. Scholars, historians, and the public typically rank Roosevelt alongside [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[George Washington]] as one of the three [[historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|greatest U.S. presidents]].\n\n==Election of 1940==\n{{Main|1940 United States presidential election}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|right|thumb|275px|1940 electoral vote results]]\nThe two-term tradition had been an unwritten rule (until the ratification of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] after Roosevelt's presidency) since [[George Washington]] declined to run for a third term in 1796. Both [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] were attacked for trying to obtain a third non-consecutive term. Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination, including Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. | series =[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] | title = The Path to Power | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Alfred A.

Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine, which controlled the auditorium sound system. At the convention the opposition was poorly organized, but Farley had packed the galleries. Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone. The delegates were stunned; then the loudspeaker screamed \"We want Roosevelt... The world wants Roosevelt!\" The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot. The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful, as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 428}} At Roosevelt's request, the convention nominated Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace for vice president. Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal, but were unable to prevent his nomination.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nWorld War II shook up the Republican field, possibly preventing the nomination of isolationist congressional leaders like Taft or Vandenberg. The [[1940 Republican National Convention]] instead nominated [[Wendell Willkie]], the first major party nominee since [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] who had never held public office. A well-known corporate attorney and executive, Willkie rose to public notice through his criticism of the New Deal and his clashes with the TVA. Unlike his isolationist rivals for the Republican nomination, Willkie favored Britain in the war, and he was backed by internationalist Republicans like [[Henry Luce]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=455\u2013456}} Willkie's internationalist views initially prevented the issue of foreign policy from dominating the campaign, helping to allow for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the establishment of a peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=459\u2013460}}\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Willkie and other Republicans stepped up their attacks on Roosevelt's foreign policy. Willkie warned that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to the deployment of U.S. troops abroad. In response, Roosevelt stated that \"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\"{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=462\u2013463}} Roosevelt won the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]] with 55% of the popular vote and almost 85% of the electoral vote (449 to 82).{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 454}} Willkie won ten states: strongly Republican states of Vermont and Maine, and eight isolationist states in the Midwest.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=463\u2013464}} The Democrats retained their congressional majorities, but the conservative coalition largely controlled domestic legislation and remained \"leery of presidential extensions of executive power through social programs.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein, eds.|title=The encyclopedia of American political history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IYYAAAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=CQ Press|page=332|isbn=9781568025117}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n===Executive branch===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Roosevelt\n|President=Franklin D.

[[Frank Knox]], the 1936 Republican vice presidential nominee, became [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] while former Secretary of State [[Henry L. Stimson]] became [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. Roosevelt began convening a \"war cabinet\" consisting of Hull, Stimson, Knox, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Harold Rainsford Stark]], and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George Marshall]].{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 622\u2013623}} In 1942 Roosevelt set up a new military command structure with Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] (Stark's successor) as in complete control of the Navy and Marines. Marshall was in charge of the Army and nominally led the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = John Whiteclay | last1 = Chambers | first2 = Fred | last2 = Anderson | title = The Oxford companion to American military history | year = 2000 | page = 351}}</ref> The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency and was chaired by his old friend Admiral [[William D.

Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides, especially [[Harry Hopkins]]. Since Hopkins also controlled $40 billion in Lend-Lease funds given to the Allies, they paid attention to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Fullilove|title=Rendezvous with Destiny: How Franklin D.

He elevated [[Harlan F. Stone]] to chief justice and appointed Senator [[James F. Byrnes]] of South Carolina and Attorney General [[Robert H. Jackson]] as associate justices. The combination of the liberal Jackson, centrist Stone, and conservative Byrnes helped ensure the Senate confirmation of all three justices. Byrnes disliked serving on the Court, and he resigned to take a position in the Roosevelt administration in 1942.{{Sfn|Clouatre|2012|pp=40\u201341}} He was replaced by [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]], a liberal federal appellate judge who would serve on the Supreme Court for just seven years.{{Sfn|Clouatre|2012|p=45}} By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed Stone, [[Hugo Black]], [[Stanley Forman Reed]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[William O.

The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control.]]\n\n===Early 1941===\nAfter his victory over [[Wendell Willkie]] in the 1940 election, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} In December 1940, Roosevelt received a letter from Churchill asking the U.S. to repeal the cash and carry provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces committed to defending against Germany, Churchill asked for the United States to provide loans and shipping for American goods.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=467\u2013468}} In response, Roosevelt delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]],\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} He stated, \"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas\u2013and they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\"{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=401\u2013402}} \n\nIn his January 1941 [[Four Freedoms]] speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=487\u2013488}} In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a [[Lend-Lease]] program designed to provide military aid to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=469\u2013470}} With the backing of Willkie,{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=489\u2013490}} the Lend-Lease bill passed by large majorities in both houses of Congress, with most of the opposition coming from Midwestern Republicans. Isolationists did, however, prevent the U.S. from providing naval escorts to merchant ships heading to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=473\u2013474}} Roosevelt also requested, and Congress, granted, a major boost in military expenditures. With this boost in spending, the unemployment rate dropped below ten percent for the first time in over a decade. To oversee mobilization efforts, Roosevelt created the Office of Production Management, the [[Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply]], and the [[Supply Priorities and Allocation Board]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=476\u2013478}} \n\nIn late 1940, Admiral Stark had sent Roosevelt the [[Plan Dog memo]], which set forth a four strategic war plans for fighting an anticipated [[two-front war]] against Japan and Germany. Of the four strategies, Stark advocated for the so-called \"Plan Dog,\" which contemplated a [[Europe first]] strategy and the avoidance of conflict with Japan for as long as possible. A key part of this strategy was to ensure that Britain remained in the fight against Germany until the United States, potentially with the aid of other countries, could launch a land offensive into Europe. Roosevelt did not publicly commit to Plan Dog, but it motivated him to launch talks between American and British military staff, codenamed \"[[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC\u20131]].\" In early 1941, American and British military planners jointly agreed to pursue a Europe first strategy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=479\u2013480}} In July 1941, Roosevelt ordered Secretary of War Stimson to begin planning for total American military involvement. The resulting \"Victory Program\" provided the army's estimates of the mobilization of manpower, industry, and logistics necessary to defeat Germany and Japan. The program planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to prepare a force of ten million men in arms, half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943.{{Sfn | Churchill | 1977 | p = 119}}\n\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied side]] with a policy of \"all aid short of war.\"{{Sfn | Churchill | 1977 | p = 119}} Some Americans were reluctant to aid the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt believed that the Soviets would be indispensable in the defeat of Germany.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=532\u2013533}} Execution of the aid fell victim to foot dragging in the administration, so FDR appointed a special assistant, [[Wayne Coy]], to expedite matters.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 115}}\n\n===Late 1941===\n{{see also|Battle of the Atlantic}}\n\nIn February 1941, Hitler refocused the war against Britain from air operations to naval operations, specifically [[U-boat]] (German submarine) raids against convoys headed to Britain. In response to these attacks, Churchill requested that the United States provide convoy escorts, but Roosevelt was still reluctant to challenge anti-war sentiment.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=488\u2013492}} In May, German submarines sank the ''[[SS Robin Moor|SS ''Robin Moor'']],'' an American freighter, but Roosevelt declined to use the incident as a pretext to increase the navy's role in the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Axis Powers experienced success in their campaigns against the Soviet Union, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], and British forces in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=493\u2013495}}\n\nIn August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in [[Argentia]], [[Newfoundland]]. This meeting produced the [[Atlantic Charter]], which conceptually outlined global wartime and postwar goals.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 126\u201328}} Each leader pledged to support democracy, [[self-determination]], free trade, and principles of non-aggression.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=496}} Less than a month after Roosevelt and Churchill met at Argentia, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer ''[[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]]''. In response, Roosevelt announced a new policy in which the U.S. would attack German or Italian ships that entered U.S. naval zones.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=497\u2013498}} This \"shoot on sight\" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 141\u201342}} The Roosevelt administration also peacefully established U.S. control over [[Greenland]] and [[Ireland]], which provided useful naval bases in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Seeking to bolster U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere against German influence, the Roosevelt administration increased military, commercial, and cultural engagement with Latin America.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=526\u2013529, 533}} Hitler did not aggressively respond to U.S. actions, as he wanted to avoid any incident that would bring the U.S. into the war prior to the defeat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=492, 498\u2013499}}\n\nIn October 1941, the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|USS ''Kearny'']], along with other ships, engaged a number of U-boats south of Iceland; the ''Kearny'' took fire and lost eleven crewmen.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 148}} Following the attack, Congress amended the Neutrality Act to allow U.S. ships to transport material to Britain, effectively repealing the last provision of the cash and carry policy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=499\u2013500}} However, neither the ''Kearny'' incident nor an attack on the ''[[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|USS ''Reuben James'']]'' changed public opinion as much as Roosevelt hoped they might.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 615\u2013616}}\n\n===Tensions with Japan===\n{{Further|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Germany.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Roosevelt signing declaration of war [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|against Japan]] (left) on December&nbsp;8 and [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|against Germany]] (right) on December&nbsp;11, 1941.\n}}\n\nBy 1940, Japan had conquered much of the Chinese coast and major river valleys, but had been unable to defeat either the [[Nationalist government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] forces under [[Mao Zedong]]. Though Japan's government was nominally led by the civilian government of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe|Fumimaro Konoye]], [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of War]] [[Hideki Tojo]] and other military leaders held immense power in the Japanese governmental system.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=502\u2013504, 673}} At Tojo's insistence, Japan moved to take control of lightly-defended European colonies in Southeast Asia, which provided important resources as well as a conduit of supply to Chinese forces.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=504}} When Japan [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|occupied]] northern [[French Indochina]] in late 1940, Roosevelt authorized increased aid to the Republic of China, a policy that won widespread popular support.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 134\u201346}} He also implemented a partial embargo on Japan, preventing the export of iron and steel. Over the next year, the Roosevelt administration debated imposing an embargo on oil, the key American export to Japan. Though some in the administration wanted to do everything possible to prevent Japanese expansion, Secretary of State Hull feared that cutting off trade would encourage the Japanese to meet its needs for natural resources through the conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[British Malaya]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], or the Philippines.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=505\u2013507}}  \n\nWith Roosevelt's attention focused on Europe, Hull took the lead in setting Asian policy and negotiating with Japan.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=505\u2013507}} Beginning in March 1941, Hull and Japanese ambassador [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura]] sought to reach an accommodation between their respective governments. As the U.S. was not willing to accept the Japanese occupation of China, and Japan was not willing to withdraw from that country, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. After Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Japanese declined to attack Soviet forces in [[Siberia]], ending a long-running internal debate over the best target for Japanese expansion. In July, Japan took control of southern French Indochina, which provided a potential staging ground for an attack on British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=507\u2013508}} In response, the U.S. cut off the sale of oil to Japan, which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 134\u201346}} \n\nFollowing the American embargo, Japanese leaders turned their attention to the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, which had a large supply of oil. In order to consolidate control of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese military planners believed that they needed to capture the Philippines, take control of the British base at [[Singapore]], and defeat the [[United States Pacific Fleet]], which was stationed at the [[Hawaii]]an [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]]. No Japanese leader saw the total defeat of the United States as a feasible outcome, but many hoped that a decisive naval victory would convince the Americans to leave control of the Pacific to Japan. Prime Minister Konoye sought a summit with Roosevelt in order to avoid war, but the continued U.S. insistence on the Japanese withdrawal from China scuttled those plans. Tojo succeeded Konoye as prime minister in October, and the Japanese began preparations for an attack on the United States. In November, Nomura made a final offer, asking for reopened trade and acceptance of the Japanese campaign in China in return for Japan's pledge not to attack Southeast Asia. In large part because the U.S. feared that Japan would attack the Soviet Union after conquering China, Roosevelt declined the offer, and negotiations collapsed on November 26.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=512\u2013515}}\n\n===Entrance into the war===\n\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack]], knocking out the main American [[battleship]] fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=520\u2013522}} The great majority of scholars have rejected the [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|conspiracy thesis]] that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend-Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt sought a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General George Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \"[[Europe first]]\" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender.

If each country devotes roughly the same fraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of war is distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay.\n\nA major issue in the economic war was the transportation of supplies. After Germany declared war on the United States, Hitler removed all restrictions on the German submarine fleet. German submarines ravaged Allied shipping in the Atlantic, with many of the attacks taking place within ten miles of the [[East Coast of the United States]] in early 1942.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=565\u2013569}} The U.S. Navy faced difficulties in simultaneously protecting Atlantic shipping while also prosecuting the war against Japan, and over one millions tons of Allied shipping was lost in 1942.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=569\u2013571}} The cracking of the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma code]], along with the construction and deployment of American naval escorts and [[maritime patrol aircraft]] helped give the Allied Powers the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic after 1942. After the Allies sank dozens of U-boats early 1943, most German submarines were withdrawn from the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=589\u2013590}}\n\nThe United States began a [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]] campaign against Axis forces in Europe in mid-1942.

He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the prevalence of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] and [[antisemitism]] among voters and members of Congress, resistance in the [[American Jew]]ish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and the restrictive [[Immigration Act of 1924]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=426\u2013428}} The Immigration Act of 1924 allowed only 150,000 immigrants to the United States per year and set firm quotas for each country, and in midst of the Great Depression there was little popular support for revisions to the law that would allow for a more liberal immigration policy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=413\u2013414, 417}} Roosevelt pushed the limits of his executive authority where possible, which allowed for several Austrian and German Jews, including [[Albert Einstein]], to escape from Europe or remain in the United States past their visa expiration.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=414\u2013416}}\n\nHitler chose to implement the \"[[Final Solution]]\"\u2013the extermination of the European Jewish population\u2013by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]], which condemned the ongoing [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and promised to try its perpetrators as [[War crime|war criminals]]. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the [[War Refugee Board]] to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the [[extermination camps]] or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt himself.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=607\u2013613}}\n\n==Homefront==\n{{Further|United States home front during World War II}}\n\n===Relations with Congress===\nUp until Pearl Harbor, Congress played a very active role in foreign and military policy, dealing with neutrality laws, the draft, and Lend Lease. As with the general public, congressional sentiment was very hostile toward Germany and Japan, favorable toward China, and somewhat less favorable toward Britain. Democratic congressman with strong German, Irish Catholic, or Scandinavian constituencies generally supported isolationist policies, as did most Republicans. After Pearl Harbor, isolationism disappeared in Congress and was not a factor in the 1942 or 1944 elections. Some leading isolationists, most notably Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan, Senator [[Warren Austin]] of Vermont, and Congressman [[Everett Dirksen]] of Illinois, became leading internationalists.<ref>Garry Boulard, \"Arthur H.

Taft]] stayed quiet on foreign and defense issues, while many of the energetic isolationists of the 1930s, including Hiram Johnson and William Borah, were in poor health or had seen their influence decline. During the war, there were no secret briefings, and members of Congress were often no better informed than the average newspaper reader. Congressman did pay attention to military installations in their district, but rarely raised issues of broader military or diplomatic scope, with the partial exception of postwar plans.<ref>Roland Young, ''Congressional Politics in the Second World War'' (1956), pp 144-96.</ref> Congress also established the [[Truman Committee]], which investigated wartime profiteering and other defects in war production.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=791}} Debates on domestic policy were as heated as ever, and the major Republican gains in Congress in 1938 and 1942 gave the Conservative Coalition the dominant voice on most domestic issues.<ref>Young, ''Congressional Politics'' (1956), pp 220-23.</ref><ref>James T.

The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in early 1940 to 3.4 million in late 1941, and fell in half again to 1.5 million in late 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million.{{Efn|WPA workers were counted as unemployed by this set of statistics.<ref>{{Citation|place=US|publisher=Bureau of the Census|title=Statistical Abstract|year=1946|page=173}}</ref>}} To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded.{{Sfn|Schweikart|Allen|2004|p=602}} The [[Revenue Act of 1942]] instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the [[excess profits tax]]) and instituted the first federal [[withholding tax]].{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 221\u2013222}} It also greatly increased the tax base; only four million Americans paid the federal income taxes before the war, while by the end of the war over 40 million Americans paid federal income taxes.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=624}} In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|smaller revenue bill]] raising $2 billion.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=436}} Congress also abolished several New Deal agencies, including the CCC and the WPA.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=249}} \n\n[[File:Second Bill of Rights Speech.ogv|thumb|Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced the plan for a [[Second Bill of Rights|bill of social and economic rights]] in January, 1944.

Benefits included tuition and living expense to attend high school or college, a year of unemployment pay at $20 a week, and low-cost loans to buy homes, farms and businesses.<ref>Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin, ''The GI Bill: A New Deal for Veterans'' (2009) pp 54-57.</ref> The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944.

Congress also created tax incentives designed to encourage the shift to military production, while the Reconstruction Finance Corporation continued to offer loans to help expand industrial capacity. Despite efforts made by Congress to encourage contracting with smaller companies, most military contracts went to the largest corporations in the United States.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=619\u2013623}} War production increased dramatically after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but that production fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=333}} The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=343}}{{sfn|Herman|2012|pp=139\u201344, 151, 246}} Mobilization was also affected by the military service of over 16 million individuals during the war; approximately one-in-five families had at least one individual serve during the war.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=632\u2013637}}\n\nDespite various challenges, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4 million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40 billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=571\u2013572}} The United States suffered from inflation during the war, and the administration instituted price and wage controls.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=242\u2013243}} In 1943, Roosevelt established the [[Office of War Mobilization]] (OWM) to oversee war production.

Roosevelt series}}\n\nThe '''third and fourth terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt''' began on January 20, 1941, the date of [[Third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's third inauguration]], and ended with Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. Roosevelt won a third term by defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Wendell Willkie]] in the [[1940 United States presidential election]]. He remains the only president to serve for more than two terms. Unlike his [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms|first two terms in office]], Roosevelt's third and fourth terms were dominated by foreign policy concerns, as the United States became a belligerent in [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\nAfter defeating Willkie, Roosevelt won congressional approval of the [[Lend-Lease]] program, which was designed to aid [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in its war against Germany. After Germany declared war on the [[Soviet Union]], Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union as well. In Asia, Roosevelt provided aid to the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which was resisting an invasion by the [[Empire of Japan]]. In response to the July 1941 Japanese occupation of southern [[French Indochina]], Roosevelt expanded a trade embargo on Japan. After attempting to re-open oil exports, Japan launched an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]] on the U.S. fleet stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]]. In response, Congress declared war on Japan and, eventually, Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Along with Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, the United States became a leading member of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. In consultation with military officials and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Roosevelt decided on a [[Europe first]] strategy, which focused on defeating Germany before Japan.\n\nRather than immediately launching an invasion of occupied [[France]] or other parts of Europe, Britain and the U.S. began the campaign against Germany with an invasion of [[North Africa]]. After some initial difficulties, Allied forces compelled the surrender of Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943. Meanwhile, the United States won a decisive victory over Japan in the [[Battle of Midway]] and began a campaign of [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In 1943, the Allies launched an [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]] and continued to pursue the island hopping strategy. The major Allied leaders met at the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943, where they began to discuss post-war plans. Among the concepts discussed was the [[United Nations]], an intergovernmental organization championed by Roosevelt that would replace the [[League of Nations]] after the war. In 1944, the U.S. launched a [[Operation Overlord|successful invasion]] of northern France and won a decisive naval victory over Japan in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. By the time of Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the U.S. had occupied portions of Germany and was in the process of [[Battle of Okinawa|capturing]] [[Okinawa]]. Germany and Japan would both surrender within six months of Roosevelt's death during the administration of Roosevelt's third and final vice president, [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\nThough foreign affairs dominated Roosevelt's third and fourth terms, important developments also took place on the home front. The military buildup spurred economic growth, and unemployment fell precipitously. The United States excelled at war production; in 1944, it produced more military aircraft than the combined output of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States also established the [[Manhattan Project]] to produce the world's first [[nuclear weapon]]s. As in Roosevelt's second term, the [[conservative coalition]] prevented Roosevelt from passing major domestic legislation, though it did increase taxes to help pay for the war. Congress also passed the [[G.I. Bill]], which provided several benefits to World War II veterans. Roosevelt avoided imposing heavy-handed censorship or harsh crackdowns on war-time dissent, but his administration relocated and [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned]] over a hundred thousand Japanese Americans. Roosevelt also prohibited religious and racial discrimination in the defense industry and established the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]], the first national program designed to prevent employment discrimination. Scholars, historians, and the public typically rank Roosevelt alongside [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[George Washington]] as one of the three [[historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|greatest U.S. presidents]].\n\n==Election of 1940==\n{{Main|1940 United States presidential election}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|right|thumb|275px|1940 electoral vote results]]\nThe two-term tradition had been an unwritten rule (until the ratification of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] after Roosevelt's presidency) since [[George Washington]] declined to run for a third term in 1796. Both [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] were attacked for trying to obtain a third non-consecutive term. Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination, including Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. | series =[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] | title = The Path to Power | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Alfred A.

Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine, which controlled the auditorium sound system. At the convention the opposition was poorly organized, but Farley had packed the galleries. Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone. The delegates were stunned; then the loudspeaker screamed \"We want Roosevelt... The world wants Roosevelt!\" The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot. The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful, as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 428}} At Roosevelt's request, the convention nominated Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace for vice president. Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal, but were unable to prevent his nomination.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nWorld War II shook up the Republican field, possibly preventing the nomination of isolationist congressional leaders like Taft or Vandenberg. The [[1940 Republican National Convention]] instead nominated [[Wendell Willkie]], the first major party nominee since [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] who had never held public office. A well-known corporate attorney and executive, Willkie rose to public notice through his criticism of the New Deal and his clashes with the TVA. Unlike his isolationist rivals for the Republican nomination, Willkie favored Britain in the war, and he was backed by internationalist Republicans like [[Henry Luce]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=455\u2013456}} Willkie's internationalist views initially prevented the issue of foreign policy from dominating the campaign, helping to allow for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the establishment of a peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=459\u2013460}}\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Willkie and other Republicans stepped up their attacks on Roosevelt's foreign policy. Willkie warned that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to the deployment of U.S. troops abroad. In response, Roosevelt stated that \"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\"{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=462\u2013463}} Roosevelt won the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]] with 55% of the popular vote and almost 85% of the electoral vote (449 to 82).{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 454}} Willkie won ten states: strongly Republican states of Vermont and Maine, and eight isolationist states in the Midwest.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=463\u2013464}} The Democrats retained their congressional majorities, but the conservative coalition largely controlled domestic legislation and remained \"leery of presidential extensions of executive power through social programs.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein, eds.|title=The encyclopedia of American political history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IYYAAAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=CQ Press|page=332|isbn=9781568025117}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n===Executive branch===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Roosevelt\n|President=Franklin D.

[[Frank Knox]], the 1936 Republican vice presidential nominee, became [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] while former Secretary of State [[Henry L. Stimson]] became [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. Roosevelt began convening a \"war cabinet\" consisting of Hull, Stimson, Knox, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Harold Rainsford Stark]], and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George Marshall]].{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 622\u2013623}} In 1942 Roosevelt set up a new military command structure with Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] (Stark's successor) as in complete control of the Navy and Marines. Marshall was in charge of the Army and nominally led the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = John Whiteclay | last1 = Chambers | first2 = Fred | last2 = Anderson | title = The Oxford companion to American military history | year = 2000 | page = 351}}</ref> The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency and was chaired by his old friend Admiral [[William D.

Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides, especially [[Harry Hopkins]]. Since Hopkins also controlled $40 billion in Lend-Lease funds given to the Allies, they paid attention to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Fullilove|title=Rendezvous with Destiny: How Franklin D.

He elevated [[Harlan F. Stone]] to chief justice and appointed Senator [[James F. Byrnes]] of South Carolina and Attorney General [[Robert H. Jackson]] as associate justices. The combination of the liberal Jackson, centrist Stone, and conservative Byrnes helped ensure the Senate confirmation of all three justices. Byrnes disliked serving on the Court, and he resigned to take a position in the Roosevelt administration in 1942.{{Sfn|Clouatre|2012|pp=40\u201341}} He was replaced by [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]], a liberal federal appellate judge who would serve on the Supreme Court for just seven years.{{Sfn|Clouatre|2012|p=45}} By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed Stone, [[Hugo Black]], [[Stanley Forman Reed]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[William O.

The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control.]]\n\n===Early 1941===\nAfter his victory over [[Wendell Willkie]] in the 1940 election, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} In December 1940, Roosevelt received a letter from Churchill asking the U.S. to repeal the cash and carry provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces committed to defending against Germany, Churchill asked for the United States to provide loans and shipping for American goods.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=467\u2013468}} In response, Roosevelt delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]],\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} He stated, \"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas\u2013and they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\"{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=401\u2013402}} \n\nIn his January 1941 [[Four Freedoms]] speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=487\u2013488}} In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a [[Lend-Lease]] program designed to provide military aid to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=469\u2013470}} With the backing of Willkie,{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=489\u2013490}} the Lend-Lease bill passed by large majorities in both houses of Congress, with most of the opposition coming from Midwestern Republicans. Isolationists did, however, prevent the U.S. from providing naval escorts to merchant ships heading to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=473\u2013474}} Roosevelt also requested, and Congress, granted, a major boost in military expenditures. With this boost in spending, the unemployment rate dropped below ten percent for the first time in over a decade. To oversee mobilization efforts, Roosevelt created the Office of Production Management, the [[Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply]], and the [[Supply Priorities and Allocation Board]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=476\u2013478}} \n\nIn late 1940, Admiral Stark had sent Roosevelt the [[Plan Dog memo]], which set forth a four strategic war plans for fighting an anticipated [[two-front war]] against Japan and Germany. Of the four strategies, Stark advocated for the so-called \"Plan Dog,\" which contemplated a [[Europe first]] strategy and the avoidance of conflict with Japan for as long as possible. A key part of this strategy was to ensure that Britain remained in the fight against Germany until the United States, potentially with the aid of other countries, could launch a land offensive into Europe. Roosevelt did not publicly commit to Plan Dog, but it motivated him to launch talks between American and British military staff, codenamed \"[[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC\u20131]].\" In early 1941, American and British military planners jointly agreed to pursue a Europe first strategy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=479\u2013480}} In July 1941, Roosevelt ordered Secretary of War Stimson to begin planning for total American military involvement. The resulting \"Victory Program\" provided the army's estimates of the mobilization of manpower, industry, and logistics necessary to defeat Germany and Japan. The program planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to prepare a force of ten million men in arms, half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943.{{Sfn | Churchill | 1977 | p = 119}}\n\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied side]] with a policy of \"all aid short of war.\"{{Sfn | Churchill | 1977 | p = 119}} Some Americans were reluctant to aid the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt believed that the Soviets would be indispensable in the defeat of Germany.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=532\u2013533}} Execution of the aid fell victim to foot dragging in the administration, so FDR appointed a special assistant, [[Wayne Coy]], to expedite matters.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 115}}\n\n===Late 1941===\n{{see also|Battle of the Atlantic}}\n\nIn February 1941, Hitler refocused the war against Britain from air operations to naval operations, specifically [[U-boat]] (German submarine) raids against convoys headed to Britain. In response to these attacks, Churchill requested that the United States provide convoy escorts, but Roosevelt was still reluctant to challenge anti-war sentiment.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=488\u2013492}} In May, German submarines sank the ''[[SS Robin Moor|SS ''Robin Moor'']],'' an American freighter, but Roosevelt declined to use the incident as a pretext to increase the navy's role in the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Axis Powers experienced success in their campaigns against the Soviet Union, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], and British forces in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=493\u2013495}}\n\nIn August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in [[Argentia]], [[Newfoundland]].

In response, Roosevelt announced a new policy in which the U.S. would attack German or Italian ships that entered U.S. naval zones.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=497\u2013498}} This \"shoot on sight\" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 141\u201342}} The Roosevelt administration also peacefully established U.S. control over [[Greenland]] and [[Ireland]], which provided useful naval bases in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Seeking to bolster U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere against German influence, the Roosevelt administration increased military, commercial, and cultural engagement with Latin America.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=526\u2013529, 533}} Hitler did not aggressively respond to U.S. actions, as he wanted to avoid any incident that would bring the U.S. into the war prior to the defeat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=492, 498\u2013499}}\n\nIn October 1941, the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|USS ''Kearny'']], along with other ships, engaged a number of U-boats south of Iceland; the ''Kearny'' took fire and lost eleven crewmen.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 148}} Following the attack, Congress amended the Neutrality Act to allow U.S. ships to transport material to Britain, effectively repealing the last provision of the cash and carry policy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=499\u2013500}} However, neither the ''Kearny'' incident nor an attack on the ''[[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|USS ''Reuben James'']]'' changed public opinion as much as Roosevelt hoped they might.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 615\u2013616}}\n\n===Tensions with Japan===\n{{Further|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Germany.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Roosevelt signing declaration of war [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|against Japan]] (left) on December&nbsp;8 and [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|against Germany]] (right) on December&nbsp;11, 1941.\n}}\n\nBy 1940, Japan had conquered much of the Chinese coast and major river valleys, but had been unable to defeat either the [[Nationalist government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] forces under [[Mao Zedong]]. Though Japan's government was nominally led by the civilian government of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe|Fumimaro Konoye]], [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of War]] [[Hideki Tojo]] and other military leaders held immense power in the Japanese governmental system.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=502\u2013504, 673}} At Tojo's insistence, Japan moved to take control of lightly-defended European colonies in Southeast Asia, which provided important resources as well as a conduit of supply to Chinese forces.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=504}} When Japan [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|occupied]] northern [[French Indochina]] in late 1940, Roosevelt authorized increased aid to the Republic of China, a policy that won widespread popular support.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 134\u201346}} He also implemented a partial embargo on Japan, preventing the export of iron and steel. Over the next year, the Roosevelt administration debated imposing an embargo on oil, the key American export to Japan. Though some in the administration wanted to do everything possible to prevent Japanese expansion, Secretary of State Hull feared that cutting off trade would encourage the Japanese to meet its needs for natural resources through the conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[British Malaya]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], or the Philippines.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=505\u2013507}}  \n\nWith Roosevelt's attention focused on Europe, Hull took the lead in setting Asian policy and negotiating with Japan.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=505\u2013507}} Beginning in March 1941, Hull and Japanese ambassador [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura]] sought to reach an accommodation between their respective governments. As the U.S. was not willing to accept the Japanese occupation of China, and Japan was not willing to withdraw from that country, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. After Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Japanese declined to attack Soviet forces in [[Siberia]], ending a long-running internal debate over the best target for Japanese expansion. In July, Japan took control of southern French Indochina, which provided a potential staging ground for an attack on British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=507\u2013508}} In response, the U.S. cut off the sale of oil to Japan, which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | pp = 134\u201346}} \n\nFollowing the American embargo, Japanese leaders turned their attention to the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, which had a large supply of oil. In order to consolidate control of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese military planners believed that they needed to capture the Philippines, take control of the British base at [[Singapore]], and defeat the [[United States Pacific Fleet]], which was stationed at the [[Hawaii]]an [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]]. No Japanese leader saw the total defeat of the United States as a feasible outcome, but many hoped that a decisive naval victory would convince the Americans to leave control of the Pacific to Japan. Prime Minister Konoye sought a summit with Roosevelt in order to avoid war, but the continued U.S. insistence on the Japanese withdrawal from China scuttled those plans. Tojo succeeded Konoye as prime minister in October, and the Japanese began preparations for an attack on the United States. In November, Nomura made a final offer, asking for reopened trade and acceptance of the Japanese campaign in China in return for Japan's pledge not to attack Southeast Asia. In large part because the U.S. feared that Japan would attack the Soviet Union after conquering China, Roosevelt declined the offer, and negotiations collapsed on November 26.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=512\u2013515}}\n\n===Entrance into the war===\n\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack]], knocking out the main American [[battleship]] fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=520\u2013522}} The great majority of scholars have rejected the [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|conspiracy thesis]] that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, and while senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.{{Sfn | Smith | 2007 | pp = 523\u201339}} Roosevelt had anticipated that the first attack would take place in the Dutch East Indies, [[Thailand]], or the Philippines.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 159}}{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 622\u2013623}}\n\n[[File:Second world war asia 1937-1942 map en6.png|right|thumb|400px|Map of Japanese military advances, until mid-1942]]\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight.

Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend-Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt sought a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General George Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \"[[Europe first]]\" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brands|title=Traitor to His Class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knKzMKNfGXMC&pg=PA638|year=2008|page=638|isbn=9780385528382}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

Lend lease, as passed by Congress in 1941, was a declaration of economic warfare, and that economic warfare continued after the attack on Pearl Harbor.<ref>Warren F.

Roosevelt told Congress in June 1942:<ref>McNeil, America, Britain and Russia '' (1953) pp 137-50.</ref>\n: The real costs of the war cannot be measured, nor compared, nor paid for in money. They must and are being met in blood and toil.... If each country devotes roughly the same fraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of war is distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay.\n\nA major issue in the economic war was the transportation of supplies. After Germany declared war on the United States, Hitler removed all restrictions on the German submarine fleet. German submarines ravaged Allied shipping in the Atlantic, with many of the attacks taking place within ten miles of the [[East Coast of the United States]] in early 1942.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=565\u2013569}} The U.S. Navy faced difficulties in simultaneously protecting Atlantic shipping while also prosecuting the war against Japan, and over one millions tons of Allied shipping was lost in 1942.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=569\u2013571}} The cracking of the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma code]], along with the construction and deployment of American naval escorts and [[maritime patrol aircraft]] helped give the Allied Powers the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic after 1942. After the Allies sank dozens of U-boats early 1943, most German submarines were withdrawn from the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=589\u2013590}}\n\nThe United States began a [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]] campaign against Axis forces in Europe in mid-1942.

He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the prevalence of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] and [[antisemitism]] among voters and members of Congress, resistance in the [[American Jew]]ish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and the restrictive [[Immigration Act of 1924]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=426\u2013428}} The Immigration Act of 1924 allowed only 150,000 immigrants to the United States per year and set firm quotas for each country, and in midst of the Great Depression there was little popular support for revisions to the law that would allow for a more liberal immigration policy.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=413\u2013414, 417}} Roosevelt pushed the limits of his executive authority where possible, which allowed for several Austrian and German Jews, including [[Albert Einstein]], to escape from Europe or remain in the United States past their visa expiration.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=414\u2013416}}\n\nHitler chose to implement the \"[[Final Solution]]\"\u2013the extermination of the European Jewish population\u2013by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]], which condemned the ongoing [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and promised to try its perpetrators as [[War crime|war criminals]]. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the [[War Refugee Board]] to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the [[extermination camps]] or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt himself.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=607\u2013613}}\n\n==Homefront==\n{{Further|United States home front during World War II}}\n\n===Relations with Congress===\nUp until Pearl Harbor, Congress played a very active role in foreign and military policy, dealing with neutrality laws, the draft, and Lend Lease. As with the general public, congressional sentiment was very hostile toward Germany and Japan, favorable toward China, and somewhat less favorable toward Britain. Democratic congressman with strong German, Irish Catholic, or Scandinavian constituencies generally supported isolationist policies, as did most Republicans. After Pearl Harbor, isolationism disappeared in Congress and was not a factor in the 1942 or 1944 elections. Some leading isolationists, most notably Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan, Senator [[Warren Austin]] of Vermont, and Congressman [[Everett Dirksen]] of Illinois, became leading internationalists.<ref>Garry Boulard, \"Arthur H.

Taft]] stayed quiet on foreign and defense issues, while many of the energetic isolationists of the 1930s, including Hiram Johnson and William Borah, were in poor health or had seen their influence decline. During the war, there were no secret briefings, and members of Congress were often no better informed than the average newspaper reader. Congressman did pay attention to military installations in their district, but rarely raised issues of broader military or diplomatic scope, with the partial exception of postwar plans.<ref>Roland Young, ''Congressional Politics in the Second World War'' (1956), pp 144-96.</ref> Congress also established the [[Truman Committee]], which investigated wartime profiteering and other defects in war production.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|p=791}} Debates on domestic policy were as heated as ever, and the major Republican gains in Congress in 1938 and 1942 gave the Conservative Coalition the dominant voice on most domestic issues.<ref>Young, ''Congressional Politics'' (1956), pp 220-23.</ref><ref>James T.

Roosevelt was out-maneuvered by conservatives on bill; he wanted a much narrower bill focused more on poor people, but the [[American Legion]] pushed for comprehensive coverage, regardless of income or combat experience, that would avoid the prolonged disputes in the 1920s and 1930s over the aid to veterans. Benefits included tuition and living expense to attend high school or college, a year of unemployment pay at $20 a week, and low-cost loans to buy homes, farms and businesses.<ref>Glenn C.

Congress also created tax incentives designed to encourage the shift to military production, while the Reconstruction Finance Corporation continued to offer loans to help expand industrial capacity. Despite efforts made by Congress to encourage contracting with smaller companies, most military contracts went to the largest corporations in the United States.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=619\u2013623}} War production increased dramatically after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but that production fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=333}} The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=343}}{{sfn|Herman|2012|pp=139\u201344, 151, 246}} Mobilization was also affected by the military service of over 16 million individuals during the war; approximately one-in-five families had at least one individual serve during the war.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=632\u2013637}}\n\nDespite various challenges, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4 million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40 billion rounds of ammunition.

The cooperation with Darlan allowed the Allies to quickly gain control of much of North Africa, but it also alienated [[Free France|Free French]] leader [[Charles de Gaulle]] and other opponents of the Vichy regime. Darlan was assassinated in December 1942, while Vichy France broke relations with the United States and requested that German forces prevent the Allies from gaining control of French [[Tunisia]]. The experience with de Gaulle, Darlan, and another French leader, [[Henri Giraud]], convinced Roosevelt of the necessity to avoid becoming closely associated with any French faction for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=581\u2013583}} In the [[Tunisian Campaign]], Eisenhower initially faced great difficulties in leading his inexperienced force to success, but Allied forces eventually gained the upper hand. 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendered in May 1943, bringing an end to the [[North African Campaign]].{{sfn|Kennedy 1999|pp=583\u2013584}}\n\nAt the January 1943 [[Casablanca Conference]], the U.S. and Britain agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of [[Sicily]] after the North African campaign, with an attack on France to follow in 1944.

When the Spaniards came, they found communities with only twenty to thirty people, as well as large and prestigious principalities.\n\nThe coastal villages were more accessible to trade with foreigners.

Several barangays, consisting of households loyal to a datu, Rajah or Sultan banded together to form larger cosmopolitan polities as an apex city states.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>   The Rulers  of these barangays would then select the most senior or most respected among them to serve as a paramount datu.  These polities sometimes had other names (such as '''bayan''' in the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog regions]]<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/>) but since the terminology varies from case to case, scholars such as Jocano<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> and Scott<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> simply refer to them as \"larger\" barangays.\n\nThe etymology of '''bayan''' can be traced back to the word \"''bahayan''\", meaning a \"community\", or literally \"a place with many households.\"<ref name=\"Odal2000\">{{cite book | title=The River Dwellers, in Book Pasig : The River of Life (Edited by Reynaldo Gamboa Alejandro and Alfred A.

Among the most significant of these dictionaries was the [[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]] by the Augustinian missionary Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura, who described it as a large town with four to ten datu lived with their followers, called dulohan or barangay.<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\">{{Cite book|title=Vocabulario de lengua tagala: el romance castellano puesto primero|last=Buenaventura|first=Pedro de San|publisher=|year=1613|isbn=|location=[[Pila, Laguna|Pila]]|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the various polities of the Philippine archipelago were united into a single political entity during colonial times, the term gradually lost its original specific meaning, and took on more generic, descriptive denotations: population center (''poblacion'') or capital (''cabisera''); municipality; or in the broadest sense, \"country\".<ref group=\"Notes\">Another word, ''bansa'' or ''bangsa'', is translated \"nation\".</ref>\n\nAmong the most prominent of these bayan entities were those in [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]], [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], [[Caboloan|Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu|Cebu]], Bohol, [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]], [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Cotabato]], and [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]].<ref name=\"Junker1998\">{{cite journal | title=Integrating History and Archaeology in the Study of Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms | author=Junker, Laura Lee | journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology | year=1998 | volume=2 | issue=4| pages=291\u2013320 | doi=10.1023/A:1022611908759 }}</ref><ref name=\"Scott1994\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=William Henry |authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian) |title= Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society |publisher= Ateneo de Manila University Press |year= 1994 |location= Quezon City |isbn=971-550-135-4 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough popular portrayals and early nationalist historical texts sometimes depict Philippine paramount rulers as having broad sovereign powers and holding vast territories, critical historiographers such as Jocano,<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|pages=160\u2013161}} Scott,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> and Junker<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> explain that historical sources clearly show paramount leaders exercised only a limited degree of influence, which did not include claims over the barangays and territories of less-senior datus.\n\nFor example, [[F.

Each datu ruled his barangay independently.  The alliances were limited to mutual protection and assistance in times of need.  It did not entail permanent allegiance. The grouping was based on consensus. Whoever was chosen by the groups as their leader exercised leadership and asserted authority over them.  It was a living democracy...Barangay alliances were loosely defined. These were often based on kinship and marriage. Each Barangay remained independent and enjoyed freedom from external control.  That was why Lapulapu resisted the attempt of Magellan to make him acknowledge the lordship of Humabon. The same was true of the other datus who resisted coercive efforts of the Spaniards to make them subservient to other Datus.\"''</blockquote>\n\nKeifer<ref name=\"Keifer1972\">{{cite book | title=The Tausug: Violence and Law in a Philippine Muslim Society | publisher=Holt, Rineheart and Winston | author=Keifer, Thomas | year=1972 | location=New York | isbn=0881332429}}</ref> compares this situation to similarly-structured African polities where ''\"component units of the political structure consist of functionally and structurally equivalent segments integrated only loosely by a centralized authority dependent on the consensual delegation of power ''upwards'' (sic) through the system.\"'' Junker,<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> expounding further on Keifer's work, notes: <blockquote>''...\"While political leadership followed an explicitly symbolized heirarchy (sic) of rank <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> this leadership heirarchy (sic) did ''not'' (sic) constitute an institutionalized chain of command from center to periphery.

Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels. These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by succession of father and son and their descendants. If these were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded... When any of these chiefs was more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they were chiefs.

[[Maragtas (book)]]</ref> say that the original \"barangays\" were coastal settlements formed as a result of the migration of these [[Malayo-Polynesian]] people (who came to the archipelago) by boat from other places in [[Southeast Asia]]. Most of the ancient barangays were coastal or riverine in nature. This is because most of the people were relying on fishing for supply of protein and for their livelihood. They also travelled mostly by water up and down rivers, and along the coasts. Trails always followed river systems, which were also a major source of water for bathing, washing, and drinking.\n\n==Social Organization and Stratification==\nThe barangays in some coastal places in Panay,<ref>In Panay, the existence of highly developed and independent principalities of Ogtong (Oton) and Araut (Dumangas) was well known to early Spanish settlers in the Philippines. The Augustinian historian Gaspar de San Agustin, for example, wrote about the existence of an ancient and illustrious nobility in Araut, in his book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)''. He said: ''\"Tambi\u00e9n fund\u00f3 convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut- que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas- con la advocaci\u00f3n de nuestro Padre San Agust\u00edn...Est\u00e1 fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del r\u00edo de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay)...Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos. Antiguamente era el emporio y corte de la m\u00e1s lucida [[nobility|nobleza]] de toda aquella  isla.\"''  Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)'', Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374-375.</ref> Manila, Cebu, Jolo, and Butuan, with cosmopolitan cultures and trade relations with other Countries in Asia, were already established Principalities before the coming of the Spaniards. In these regions, even though the majority of these ''barangays'' were not large settlements, yet they had organized societies dominated by the same type of recognized aristocracy (with birthright claim to allegiance from followers), as those found in established Principalities. The aristocratic group in these pre-colonial societies was called the [[Datu]] Class. Its members were presumably the descendants of the first settlers on the land or, in the case of later arrivals, of those who were [[Datu]]s at the time of migration or conquest. Some of these Principalities have remained, even until the present, in unhispanized<ref>Historians classify four types of non-Hispanized societies in the Philippines, some of which still survive in remote and isolated parts of the Country: 1.) Classless societies; 2.) Warrior societies, characterized by a distinct warrior class, in which membership is won by personal achievement, entails privilege, duty and prescribed norms of conduct, and is requisite for community leadership; 3.) Petty Plutocracies, which are dominated socially and politically by a recognized class of rich men who attain membership through birthright, property and the performance of specified ceremonies. They are \"petty\" because their authority is localized, being extended by neither absentee landlordism nor territorial subjugation; 4.) Principalities. Cf.

William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, p. 4. Also cf. Antonio Morga, Sucessos de las Islas Filipinas, 2nd ed., Paris: 1890, p. xxxiii.</ref> the ''[[datu]]'' was at the top of the social order in a ''sakop'' or ''haop'' (elsewhere referred to as ''barangay'').<ref name=\"William Henry Scott 1998, pp. 102\">William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 102 and 112</ref>\n\nThis social order was divided into three classes. The members of the ''tumao'' class (which includes the ''datu'') were the nobility of pure royal descent,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> compared by the [[Boxer Codex]] to the titled Spanish [[lord]]s (''se\u00f1ores de titulo'').<ref name=\"William Henry Scott 1998, pp. 102\"/> Below the ''tumao'' were the vassal warrior class known as the ''[[timawa]]'', characterized by the Jesuit priest Francisco Ignatio Alcina as \"the third rank of nobility\" and by the [[conquistador]] [[Miguel de Loarca]] as \"free men, neither chiefs nor slaves\". These were people of lower nobility who were required to render military service to the ''datu'' in hunts, land wars (''[[Mangubat]]'' or ''Managayau''), or sea raids (''Mangahat'' or ''Magahat'').<ref name=\"junker\">{{cite book|author=Laura Lee Junker|title =Raiding, Trading, and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =2000|page=126&ndash;127|isbn =9789715503471|url =https://books.google.com/?id=Lbsfi30OXgMC&lpg=PA126&dq=Plasencia%20maharlika&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=Plasencia%20maharlika&f=false}}</ref> Aside from this, the ''timawa'' also paid taxes and tribute (''buwis'' or ''handug'') and were sometimes called upon for agricultural labor to the ''datu'', though the personal vassals of the ''datu'' may be exempt from such obligations (the latter were characterized by the Boxer Codex as \"knights and [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]]s).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Below the ''timawa'' were the ''[[oripun]]'' class (commoners and slaves), who rendered services to the ''tumao'' and ''timawa'' for debts or favors.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref>William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 112- 118.</ref>\n\nTo maintain purity of bloodline, the ''tumao'' usually marry only among their kind, often seeking high ranking brides in other ''barangay'', abducting them, or contracting brideprices in gold, slaves and jewelry. Meanwhile, the ''datu'' keep their marriageable daughters secluded for protection and prestige.<ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/pssr/article/viewFile/1274/1630 Seclusion and Veiling of Women: A Historical and Cultural Approach</ref> These well-guarded and protected highborn women were called ''binokot'' (literally \"veiled\" or \"swaddled\"), and the ''datu'' of pure descent (at least for four generations) were called ''potli nga datu'' or ''lubus nga datu''.<ref>William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, p. 113.</ref>\n\n===Barangays in the Tagalog Region===\n\nThe different type of culture prevalent in Luzon gave a less stable and more complex social structure to the pre-colonial Tagalog barangays of [[Manila]], [[Pampanga]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. Taking part in a more extensive commerce than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming [[wet rice]] for a living, the Tagalogs were described by the Spanish Augustinian friar [[Martin de Rada]] as more traders than warriors, and possessed distinct religious practices concerning [[anito]]s and [[dambana]]s.<ref>Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nThe more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating. A Jesuit priest [[Francisco Colin]] made an attempt to give an approximate comparison of it with the Visayan social structure in the middle of the 17th century. The term ''[[datu]]'' or ''[[lakan]]'', or ''apo'' refers to the chief, but the noble class to which the ''datu'' belonged to was known as the ''[[maginoo]]'' class. Any male member of the ''maginoo'' class can become a ''datu'' by personal achievement.<ref name=\"Scott125\">Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 125.</ref>\n\nThe term ''timawa'' referring to freemen came into use in the social structure of the Tagalogs within just twenty years after the coming of the Spaniards. The term, however, was being incorrectly applied to former ''[[alipin]]'' (commoner and slave class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. Moreover, the Tagalog ''timawa'' did not have the military prominence of the Visayan ''timawa''. The equivalent warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were known as the ''[[maharlika]]'' class.<ref name=\"Scott125\"/>\n\nAt the bottom of the social hierarchy are the members of the ''alipin'' class. There are two main subclasses of the ''alipin'' class. The ''[[aliping namamahay]]'' who owned their own houses and served their masters by paying tribute or working on their fields were the commoners and [[serf]]s, while the ''[[aliping sa gigilid]]'' who lived in their masters' houses were the servants and slaves.\n\n==Hispanization==\nUpon the arrival of the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish]], smaller ancient barangays were combined to form towns in a [[Population transfer|resettlement]] process known as [[Indian Reductions|''Reducci\u00f3n'']]. The policy coerced inhabitants of several far-flung and scattered barangays to move into an centralized ''cabecera'' (town) where a newly built church was situated. This allowed the Spanish government to control the movement of the indigenous population, to easily facilitate [[Christianization]], to conduct [[census|population counts]], and to collect [[tax|tributes]].<ref name=StateandSociety>{{cite book|last1=Abinales|first1=Patricio N.|last2=Amoroso|first2=Donna J.|title=State and Society in the Philippines|date=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0742510247|pages=53, 55|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC|accessdate=15 January 2015|chapter=New States and Reorientations 1368\u20131764}}</ref><ref name=Academia>{{cite web|last1=Alas|first1=Jos\u00e9 Mario \u201cPepe\u201d|title=28 July 1571: The Foundation Date of the Province of La Laguna|url=https://www.academia.edu/1253122|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=Blogspot>{{cite web|title=The Philippines Then and Now; Spanish Period|url=http://tabonwoman.blogspot.com/2009/05/spanish-period.html|website=[[Blogspot]]|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=22 May 2009}}</ref> Every barangay within a town was headed by the ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|cabeza de barangay]]'' (barangay chief), who formed part of the ''[[Principal\u00eda]]'' - the elite ruling class of the municipalities of the Spanish Philippines. This position was inherited from the ''datu'', and came to be known as such during the Spanish regime.  The Spanish Monarch ruled each barangay through the ''cabeza'', who also collected taxes (called tribute) from the residents for the Spanish Crown.\n\n==Difference from the modern barangay==\n{{Main|Barangay}}\nThe word [[barangay]] in modern use refers to the smallest [[administrative division]] in the [[Philippines]], also known by its former Spanish adopted name, the [[barrio]].   This modern context for the use of the term ''barangay'' was adopted during the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] when he ordered the replacement of the old barrios and municipal councils. This act was eventually codified under the 1991 [[Philippine legal codes#Local Government Code|Local Government Code]].\n\nThere are a number of distinctions between the modern Barangay or Barrio, and the city-states and independent principalities encountered by the Spanish when they first arrived in 1521 and established relatively permanent settlements in 1574. The most glaring difference would be that the modern entity represents a geographical entity, the pre-colonial barangays represented loyalty to a particular head (datu).  Even during the early days of Spanish rule, it was not unusual for people living beside each other to actually belong to different barangays.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> They owed their loyalty to different Datus.  Also, while the modern barangay represents only the smallest administrative unit of government, the barangay of precolonial times was either independent, or belonged to what was only a loose confederation of several barangays, over which the rulers picked among themselves who would be foremost - known as the ''Pangulo'' or [[Rajah]].  In most cases, his function was to make decisions which would involve multiple barangays, such as disputes between members of two different barangays. Internally, each datu retained his jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Prehispanic\">{{cite book\n  | last = Scott\n  | first = William Henry\n  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian) \n  | title = Looking for the Prehispanic Filipino\n  | publisher = New Day Publishers\n  | year = 1992\n  | location = Quezon City\n  | isbn = 971-10-0524-7  }}</ref><ref name=\"Laput\">{{cite web\n  | last = Laput\n  | first = Ernesto J.\n  | authorlink = Ernesto J.

There are only a handful of historiographers and anthropologists who have done integrative studies to examine  the commonalities and differences between these [[Polity|polities]].\n\nOne of the earliest such studies was conducted by Jesuit missionary Francisco Colin, who, in the middle of the seventeenth century,attempted an approximate comparison of the [[social stratification]] in Tagalog culture with that in the Visayan culture, which would become a reference for many later scholars.\n\nIn the contemporary era of critical scholarly analysis, the more prominent such works include the studies of anthropologist [[F. Landa Jocano]]<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> and historian-historiographer [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]].<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Junker1990\"/>   More recently, anthropologist Laura Lee Junker<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> conducted an updated comparative review of the [[social organization]] of early polities throughout the archipelago, alongside her study of inter and intra-regional trade among Philippine coastal polities.<ref name=\"Junker1998\"/>\n\n== Related concepts ==\n=== Feudalism ===\n{{main|Feudalism}}\nThe organization of pre-colonial Philippine states has often been described as or compared to Feudalism (see [[Examples of feudalism#.22Semi-feudal.22 .28non-Western European.29 feudalism|Non-Western Feudalism]]), particularly in light of [[Marxist analysis|Marxist socioeconomic analysis]].  Specifically, political scientists note that political patterns of the modern [[Republic of the Philippines]], supposedly a [[liberal democracy]], can more accurately be described using the term \"[[Cacique Democracy]]\"\n\n==== Cacique Democracy ====\n{{main|Cacique Democracy}}\nPresent-day political scientists studying the Philippines have noted that the reciprocal social obligations that characterized the pre-colonial bayan and barangay system are still in place today, albeit using the external trappings of modern liberal democracy.  The term \"Cacique Democracy\" has been used to describe the feudal political system of the [[Philippines]] where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers.<ref>Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, [http://whynationsfail.com/blog/2012/12/26/cacique-democracy.html Cacique Democracy']</ref>\n\nThe term was originally coined by [[Benedict Anderson]]<ref>Benedict Anderson, '[https://newleftreview.org/I/169/benedict-anderson-cacique-democracy-and-the-philippines-origins-and-dreams Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams]', ''New Left Review'', I (169), May\u2013June 1988</ref> from the [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] word ''Cacique''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Catastrophe of Modernity: Tragedy and the Nation in Latin American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13ogR22rwocC&pg=PA136|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5561-7|pages=136\u2013}}</ref> and its modern derivative \"caciquismo\" (sometimes translated as \"Bossism\"),<ref>Robert Kern, ''The caciques: oligarchical politics and the system of caciquismo in the Luso-Hispanic world''.

Each datu ruled his barangay independently.  The alliances were limited to mutual protection and assistance in times of need.  It did not entail permanent allegiance. The grouping was based on consensus. Whoever was chosen by the groups as their leader exercised leadership and asserted authority over them.  It was a living democracy...Barangay alliances were loosely defined. These were often based on kinship and marriage. Each Barangay remained independent and enjoyed freedom from external control.

Trails always followed river systems, which were also a major source of water for bathing, washing, and drinking.\n\n==Social Organization and Stratification==\nThe barangays in some coastal places in Panay,<ref>In Panay, the existence of highly developed and independent principalities of Ogtong (Oton) and Araut (Dumangas) was well known to early Spanish settlers in the Philippines. The Augustinian historian Gaspar de San Agustin, for example, wrote about the existence of an ancient and illustrious nobility in Araut, in his book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)''. He said: ''\"Tambi\u00e9n fund\u00f3 convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut- que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas- con la advocaci\u00f3n de nuestro Padre San Agust\u00edn...Est\u00e1 fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del r\u00edo de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay)...Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos. Antiguamente era el emporio y corte de la m\u00e1s lucida [[nobility|nobleza]] de toda aquella  isla.\"''  Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)'', Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374-375.</ref> Manila, Cebu, Jolo, and Butuan, with cosmopolitan cultures and trade relations with other Countries in Asia, were already established Principalities before the coming of the Spaniards. In these regions, even though the majority of these ''barangays'' were not large settlements, yet they had organized societies dominated by the same type of recognized aristocracy (with birthright claim to allegiance from followers), as those found in established Principalities. The aristocratic group in these pre-colonial societies was called the [[Datu]] Class. Its members were presumably the descendants of the first settlers on the land or, in the case of later arrivals, of those who were [[Datu]]s at the time of migration or conquest. Some of these Principalities have remained, even until the present, in unhispanized<ref>Historians classify four types of non-Hispanized societies in the Philippines, some of which still survive in remote and isolated parts of the Country: 1.) Classless societies; 2.) Warrior societies, characterized by a distinct warrior class, in which membership is won by personal achievement, entails privilege, duty and prescribed norms of conduct, and is requisite for community leadership; 3.) Petty Plutocracies, which are dominated socially and politically by a recognized class of rich men who attain membership through birthright, property and the performance of specified ceremonies. They are \"petty\" because their authority is localized, being extended by neither absentee landlordism nor territorial subjugation; 4.) Principalities. Cf.

William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, p. 4. Also cf. Antonio Morga, Sucessos de las Islas Filipinas, 2nd ed., Paris: 1890, p. xxxiii.</ref> the ''[[datu]]'' was at the top of the social order in a ''sakop'' or ''haop'' (elsewhere referred to as ''barangay'').<ref name=\"William Henry Scott 1998, pp. 102\">William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 102 and 112</ref>\n\nThis social order was divided into three classes. The members of the ''tumao'' class (which includes the ''datu'') were the nobility of pure royal descent,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> compared by the [[Boxer Codex]] to the titled Spanish [[lord]]s (''se\u00f1ores de titulo'').<ref name=\"William Henry Scott 1998, pp. 102\"/> Below the ''tumao'' were the vassal warrior class known as the ''[[timawa]]'', characterized by the Jesuit priest Francisco Ignatio Alcina as \"the third rank of nobility\" and by the [[conquistador]] [[Miguel de Loarca]] as \"free men, neither chiefs nor slaves\". These were people of lower nobility who were required to render military service to the ''datu'' in hunts, land wars (''[[Mangubat]]'' or ''Managayau''), or sea raids (''Mangahat'' or ''Magahat'').<ref name=\"junker\">{{cite book|author=Laura Lee Junker|title =Raiding, Trading, and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =2000|page=126&ndash;127|isbn =9789715503471|url =https://books.google.com/?id=Lbsfi30OXgMC&lpg=PA126&dq=Plasencia%20maharlika&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=Plasencia%20maharlika&f=false}}</ref> Aside from this, the ''timawa'' also paid taxes and tribute (''buwis'' or ''handug'') and were sometimes called upon for agricultural labor to the ''datu'', though the personal vassals of the ''datu'' may be exempt from such obligations (the latter were characterized by the Boxer Codex as \"knights and [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]]s).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Below the ''timawa'' were the ''[[oripun]]'' class (commoners and slaves), who rendered services to the ''tumao'' and ''timawa'' for debts or favors.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref>William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 112- 118.</ref>\n\nTo maintain purity of bloodline, the ''tumao'' usually marry only among their kind, often seeking high ranking brides in other ''barangay'', abducting them, or contracting brideprices in gold, slaves and jewelry. Meanwhile, the ''datu'' keep their marriageable daughters secluded for protection and prestige.<ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/pssr/article/viewFile/1274/1630 Seclusion and Veiling of Women: A Historical and Cultural Approach</ref> These well-guarded and protected highborn women were called ''binokot'' (literally \"veiled\" or \"swaddled\"), and the ''datu'' of pure descent (at least for four generations) were called ''potli nga datu'' or ''lubus nga datu''.<ref>William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, p. 113.</ref>\n\n===Barangays in the Tagalog Region===\n\nThe different type of culture prevalent in Luzon gave a less stable and more complex social structure to the pre-colonial Tagalog barangays of [[Manila]], [[Pampanga]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. Taking part in a more extensive commerce than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming [[wet rice]] for a living, the Tagalogs were described by the Spanish Augustinian friar [[Martin de Rada]] as more traders than warriors, and possessed distinct religious practices concerning [[anito]]s and [[dambana]]s.<ref>Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nThe more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating. A Jesuit priest [[Francisco Colin]] made an attempt to give an approximate comparison of it with the Visayan social structure in the middle of the 17th century. The term ''[[datu]]'' or ''[[lakan]]'', or ''apo'' refers to the chief, but the noble class to which the ''datu'' belonged to was known as the ''[[maginoo]]'' class. Any male member of the ''maginoo'' class can become a ''datu'' by personal achievement.<ref name=\"Scott125\">Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 125.</ref>\n\nThe term ''timawa'' referring to freemen came into use in the social structure of the Tagalogs within just twenty years after the coming of the Spaniards. The term, however, was being incorrectly applied to former ''[[alipin]]'' (commoner and slave class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. Moreover, the Tagalog ''timawa'' did not have the military prominence of the Visayan ''timawa''. The equivalent warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were known as the ''[[maharlika]]'' class.<ref name=\"Scott125\"/>\n\nAt the bottom of the social hierarchy are the members of the ''alipin'' class. There are two main subclasses of the ''alipin'' class. The ''[[aliping namamahay]]'' who owned their own houses and served their masters by paying tribute or working on their fields were the commoners and [[serf]]s, while the ''[[aliping sa gigilid]]'' who lived in their masters' houses were the servants and slaves.\n\n==Hispanization==\nUpon the arrival of the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish]], smaller ancient barangays were combined to form towns in a [[Population transfer|resettlement]] process known as [[Indian Reductions|''Reducci\u00f3n'']]. The policy coerced inhabitants of several far-flung and scattered barangays to move into an centralized ''cabecera'' (town) where a newly built church was situated. This allowed the Spanish government to control the movement of the indigenous population, to easily facilitate [[Christianization]], to conduct [[census|population counts]], and to collect [[tax|tributes]].<ref name=StateandSociety>{{cite book|last1=Abinales|first1=Patricio N.|last2=Amoroso|first2=Donna J.|title=State and Society in the Philippines|date=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0742510247|pages=53, 55|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC|accessdate=15 January 2015|chapter=New States and Reorientations 1368\u20131764}}</ref><ref name=Academia>{{cite web|last1=Alas|first1=Jos\u00e9 Mario \u201cPepe\u201d|title=28 July 1571: The Foundation Date of the Province of La Laguna|url=https://www.academia.edu/1253122|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=Blogspot>{{cite web|title=The Philippines Then and Now; Spanish Period|url=http://tabonwoman.blogspot.com/2009/05/spanish-period.html|website=[[Blogspot]]|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=22 May 2009}}</ref> Every barangay within a town was headed by the ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|cabeza de barangay]]'' (barangay chief), who formed part of the ''[[Principal\u00eda]]'' - the elite ruling class of the municipalities of the Spanish Philippines. This position was inherited from the ''datu'', and came to be known as such during the Spanish regime.  The Spanish Monarch ruled each barangay through the ''cabeza'', who also collected taxes (called tribute) from the residents for the Spanish Crown.\n\n==Difference from the modern barangay==\n{{Main|Barangay}}\nThe word [[barangay]] in modern use refers to the smallest [[administrative division]] in the [[Philippines]], also known by its former Spanish adopted name, the [[barrio]].   This modern context for the use of the term ''barangay'' was adopted during the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] when he ordered the replacement of the old barrios and municipal councils. This act was eventually codified under the 1991 [[Philippine legal codes#Local Government Code|Local Government Code]].\n\nThere are a number of distinctions between the modern Barangay or Barrio, and the city-states and independent principalities encountered by the Spanish when they first arrived in 1521 and established relatively permanent settlements in 1574. The most glaring difference would be that the modern entity represents a geographical entity, the pre-colonial barangays represented loyalty to a particular head (datu).  Even during the early days of Spanish rule, it was not unusual for people living beside each other to actually belong to different barangays.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> They owed their loyalty to different Datus.  Also, while the modern barangay represents only the smallest administrative unit of government, the barangay of precolonial times was either independent, or belonged to what was only a loose confederation of several barangays, over which the rulers picked among themselves who would be foremost - known as the ''Pangulo'' or [[Rajah]].  In most cases, his function was to make decisions which would involve multiple barangays, such as disputes between members of two different barangays. Internally, each datu retained his jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Prehispanic\">{{cite book\n  | last = Scott\n  | first = William Henry\n  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian) \n  | title = Looking for the Prehispanic Filipino\n  | publisher = New Day Publishers\n  | year = 1992\n  | location = Quezon City\n  | isbn = 971-10-0524-7  }}</ref><ref name=\"Laput\">{{cite web\n  | last = Laput\n  | first = Ernesto J.\n  | authorlink = Ernesto J.

There are only a handful of historiographers and anthropologists who have done integrative studies to examine  the commonalities and differences between these [[Polity|polities]].\n\nOne of the earliest such studies was conducted by Jesuit missionary Francisco Colin, who, in the middle of the seventeenth century,attempted an approximate comparison of the [[social stratification]] in Tagalog culture with that in the Visayan culture, which would become a reference for many later scholars.\n\nIn the contemporary era of critical scholarly analysis, the more prominent such works include the studies of anthropologist [[F. Landa Jocano]]<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> and historian-historiographer [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]].<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Junker1990\"/>   More recently, anthropologist Laura Lee Junker<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> conducted an updated comparative review of the [[social organization]] of early polities throughout the archipelago, alongside her study of inter and intra-regional trade among Philippine coastal polities.<ref name=\"Junker1998\"/>\n\n== Related concepts ==\n=== Feudalism ===\n{{main|Feudalism}}\nThe organization of pre-colonial Philippine states has often been described as or compared to Feudalism (see [[Examples of feudalism#.22Semi-feudal.22 .28non-Western European.29 feudalism|Non-Western Feudalism]]), particularly in light of [[Marxist analysis|Marxist socioeconomic analysis]].  Specifically, political scientists note that political patterns of the modern [[Republic of the Philippines]], supposedly a [[liberal democracy]], can more accurately be described using the term \"[[Cacique Democracy]]\"\n\n==== Cacique Democracy ====\n{{main|Cacique Democracy}}\nPresent-day political scientists studying the Philippines have noted that the reciprocal social obligations that characterized the pre-colonial bayan and barangay system are still in place today, albeit using the external trappings of modern liberal democracy.  The term \"Cacique Democracy\" has been used to describe the feudal political system of the [[Philippines]] where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers.<ref>Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, [http://whynationsfail.com/blog/2012/12/26/cacique-democracy.html Cacique Democracy']</ref>\n\nThe term was originally coined by [[Benedict Anderson]]<ref>Benedict Anderson, '[https://newleftreview.org/I/169/benedict-anderson-cacique-democracy-and-the-philippines-origins-and-dreams Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams]', ''New Left Review'', I (169), May\u2013June 1988</ref> from the [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] word ''Cacique''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Catastrophe of Modernity: Tragedy and the Nation in Latin American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13ogR22rwocC&pg=PA136|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5561-7|pages=136\u2013}}</ref> and its modern derivative \"caciquismo\" (sometimes translated as \"Bossism\"),<ref>Robert Kern, ''The caciques: oligarchical politics and the system of caciquismo in the Luso-Hispanic world''. Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press [1973]</ref> which refers to a [[political boss]] or leader who exercises significant power in a political system.\n\n==== Mandala ====\n{{main|Mandala (political model)|Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities}}\nIn the late 20th century, European historians who believed that historical Southeast Asian [[Polity|polities]] did not conform to [[Chinese classics|classical Chinese]] or European views of [[political geography]] began adapting the [[Sanskrit]] word \"Mandala\" (\"circle\") as a model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power distributed among [[Mueang]] or [[Kedatuan]] (principalities) in [[History of Southeast Asia#Ancient and classical kingdoms|early Southeast Asian history]].  They emphasized that these polities were defined by their centre rather than their boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dellios |first1=Rosita |title=Mandala: From Sacred Origins to Sovereign Affairs in Traditional Southeast Asia |journal=Culture Mandala |date=25 June 2019 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=9428 |url=https://cm.scholasticahq.com/article/9428-mandala-from-sacred-origins-to-sovereign-affairs-in-traditional-southeast-asia |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis model has been applied to the historical polities of Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia which traded extensively with various Bayan polities in the Philippines.  However, Southeast Asian historians such as Jocano, Scott, and Osbourne are careful to note that the Philippines and Vietnam were outside of [[greater India|the geographical scope of direct Indian influence]], and that the Philippines instead received an indirect Indian cultural influence through their relations with the Majapahit empire.  Philippine historiographers thus do not apply the term \"Mandala\" to describe early Philippine polities because doing so overemphasizes the scale of Indian influence on Philippine culture, obscuring the indigenous [[Austronesian]] cultural connections to the peoples of [[Micronesia]], [[Melanesia]], and [[Polynesia]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christianization]]\n* [[Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities ]]\n* [[Indosphere]]\n* [[Greater India]]\n* [[Paramount rulers in early Philippine history]]\n* [[Lakan]]\n* [[Thimuay]]\n* [[Datu]]\n* [[Maynila (historical polity)|Maynila]] \n* [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Balangay]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barangay (Ancient)}}\n[[Category:Barangay states|.]]\n[[Category:Barangays of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromVocabulario de la Lengua TagalatoVocabulario de la lengua tagalausingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barangay_state"}

In order to protect the colonies and maintain law and order in the solar system, the Earth Federation Government (EFG) was created. Soon, many settlers started to resent the EFG and its sphere of influence, straining the relationship between the central government and the colonies.\n\nWhile a strained peace was being forged between Earth and the colonies, a race of non-human creatures known as Deathcula invaded the System in 2084. Without provocation, they attacked the colonies and killed many of the colonists. The EFG quickly realized that the Deathcula were technologically superior and their forces were hopelessly outmatched.

Because of his flying abilities, he follows his father's footsteps in becoming a military pilot. But a problem with authority leads to Shinji's dismissal.  He takes up racing, and eventually becomes the youngest champion of all time. Personally, Shinji is less successful with women, becoming nervous whenever they are around.

A computer genius, Marianne was the chief envoy from the colonies to Earth. When the Deathcula attack, she calls on the colonies to join the EFG. During this meeting between the colony leaders, Marianne is chosen to join the ''Bismarck'' team, much to the pleasure of her father. Marianne is very technically minded, and most often helps her teammates from her station aboard the Bismarck. A brave girl, she's normally quite repulsed with the idea of killing anyone, even Deathcula. Marianne and Shinji have known each other since childhood, and soon become romantically involved.\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Chie K\u014djiro]]}}\n\n;Charles Louvre\nProfessor Charles Louvre is a scientist on Ganymede, and the father of Marianne Louvre.

Unfortunately, this planet was also dying, so the Deathcula chose to leave it and conquer the Solar System. Their technology is quite advanced, and their society is one of discipline and obedience. Physically Deathcula look and act like humans, except that they have pointed ears and canine teeth. Due to this similarity, Deathcula are easily able to infiltrate and imitate humans.\n\n;Hyuza\nHyuza is the [[chancellor]] of the Deathcula, and is a tall, frightening cyborg with a demonic death mask for a face. Hyuza lost his body in the battle of Saturn 15 years ago, when Shinji's father destroyed his spacecraft. He transferred his brain in the main computer of ''Hell\u2019s Paradise'', and then connected it to a mechanical body, becoming a cyborg. Cold and cunning, Hyuza wishes revenge toward humans so badly that he chooses as one of his plans the idea to smash ''Hell\u2019s Paradise'' into Earth, even if this means killing himself and his people as well. His most trusted commanders are Perios and Gustav, but nevertheless Hyuza keeps them under tight control.\n{{Voiced by|[[Seiz\u014d Kat\u014d]]}}\n\n;General Perios\nPerios is called from Andromeda by Hyuza himself, becoming Hyuza's most trusted subordinate.

Saber Rider ran for 52 episodes between 1987 and 1988.\n\nIn ''Saber Rider'', the majority of the action is moved out of the solar system and into the rest of the galaxy. As opposed to a private group of four, the characters were written to be a small portion of a major military enforcement group known as the Star Sheriffs. Scenes of the main characters relaxing at a night club or bar and drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] were explained as \"visiting a [[soda shop]]\". Also, since showing death on American cartoons was much less accepted at that time, the '''Outriders''' were shown to \"jump\" back to their own dimension when defeated.\n \nShinji's name was changed to '''Fireball''', and he had a crush on April Eagle (Marianne). Richard's name was changed to the titular '''Saber Rider'''. Bill became '''Colt''' and was part of a traveling rodeo until tragedy struck, after which he joined the Star Sheriffs. Marianne was renamed '''April Eagle''', and became a former tennis pro whose three love interests were Saber Rider, Jesse Blue, and Fireball. Professor Charles Louvre was renamed '''Commander Eagle''', and was the leader of Cavalry Command and the Star Sheriffs.\n\nThe Deathcula became '''The Outriders'''. In the new storyline, the Outriders were humanoids who come from another dimension called the Vapor Zone. They wanted to conquer mankind and control the universe unhindered, thinking the human dimension has much more to offer than their own. When an Outrider was shot or wounded, they did not die, but rather \"dimension jump\", a process where they vanish and return to their home dimension to reform.\n\nHyuza was given the name '''Nemesis''', and his story was altered so that he was the evil genius in charge of the renegade Outriders and the mastermind behind their insidious schemes. Perios became '''Jesse Blue''', a promising cadet at Cavalry Command until he fell in love with April Eagle during a training exercise. When April rejected his advances, he turned against the Star Sheriffs and cultivated a personal grudge against Saber Rider, ultimately becoming a fugitive, and joining forces with the Outriders. Zatola was known as '''Gattler'''.\n\nThe American animation used for the extra six episodes of ''Saber Rider'' was visibly different from the Japanese animation. Though the basic character designs remained the same, the style was vastly different from the original character art by [[Shigeru Kato]]. These new episodes were made to help enforce the changes made to the series, such as enforcing the \"Western\" theme with Cowboys and Indians, expanding on the Cavalry Command military structure, as well as showing visual evidence of Outriders reforming in their home dimension.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!Star Musketeer Bismark\n!\n![[Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs]]\n|-\n|1\n|\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u5192\u967a\u91ce\u90ce\n|1\n|Star Sheriff Round Up\n|-\n|2\n|\u4ffa\u3068\u3042\u3044\u3064\u3068\u3042\u306e\u91ce\u90ce\n|4\n|Iguana Get To Know You\n|-\n|3\n|\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u540d\u4fdd\u5b89\u5b98\n|7\n|Little Pardner\n|-\n|4 \n|\u30c7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u6483\u3066\uff01\n|8\n|Brawling Is My Calling\n|-\n|5\n|\u6fc0\u7a81\uff01\uff01 \u8352\u91ce\u306e\u6c7a\u6226\n|16\n|Show Down At Cimarron Pass\n|-\n|6 \n|\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u30a8\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n|19 \n|Sole Survivor\n|-\n|7\n|\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u611b\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\n|20\n|Legend Of The Santa Fe Express\n|-\n|8 \n|\u8b0e\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\n|9\n|Wild Horses Couldn't Drag Me Away\n|-\n|9\n|\u660e\u65e5\u3078\u306e\u6226\u3044\n|27\n|The Hole In The Wall Gang\n|-\n|10 \n|\u30ac\u30cb\u30e1\u30c7\u306e\u9b3c\u5c06\u8ecd \n|22 \n|Famous Last Words\n|-\n|11 \n|\u8001\u3044\u305f\u308b\u4e0d\u6b7b\u9ce5 \n|23 \n|Sharpshooter\n|-\n|12 \n|\u661f\u7a7a\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30ab\u30ed\u30eb\n|24  \n|The Monarch Supreme\n|-\n|13\n|\u6b7b\u795e\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\n|21\n|Snake Eyes\n|-\n|14 \n|\u767d\u9280\u306e\u6c7a\u95d8\n|29\n|Snow-Blind\n|-\n|15 \n|\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\n|5\n|Little Hombre\n|-\n|16\n|\u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u308b\u9a0e\u58eb\u9053\n|10\n|The Castle Of The Mountain Haze\n|-\n|17 \n|\u541b\u306e\u624b\u3067\u6751\u3092\u5b88\u308c\n|30 \n|Tranquility\n|-\n|18 \n|\u5730\u7344\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305f\u8056\u8005\n|41\n|The Amazing Lazardo\n|-\n|19 \n|\u79d8\u5bc6\u6697\u6bba\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u66b4\u3051\n|42\n|I Forgot\n|-\n|20\n|\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6765\u8a2a\u8005\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|21 \n|\u6050\u6016\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\n|6\n|Greatest Show On The New Frontier\n|-\n|22 \n|\u7206\u767a\uff01\uff01 \u6b7b\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9 \n|28\n|The All Galaxy Grand Prix\n|-\n|23\n|\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c6\u30f3\u30fb\u30db\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|24 \n|\u56db\u3064\u8449\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\n|12 \n|Four Leaf Clover\n|-\n|25\n|\u731b\u6483\uff01 \u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\n|37\n|Born on the Bayou\n|-\n|26 \n|\u30ac\u30cb\u30e1\u30c7\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6c7a\u6226\n|25\n|Gattler's Last Stand\n|-\n|27 \n|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6c7a\u610f ACT-1\n|35\n|The Challenge (1)\n|-\n|28 \n|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6c7a\u610f ACT-2\n|36\n|The Challenge (2)\n|-\n|29\n|\u518d\u4f1a\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\n|14\n|What Did You Do On Your Summer Vacation?\n|-\n|30\n|\u6226\u3048\uff01 \u5e73\u548c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|31 \n|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30e1\u30c0\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305f\u7537\n|15\n|Jesse Blue\n|-\n|32\n|\u30c7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u30fb\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\n|26\n|Dooley\n|-\n|33 \n|\u5e7d\u970a\u6226\u968a\u3092\u53e9\u3051\uff01\n|31\n|Bad Day At Dry Gulch\n|-\n|34\n|\u8679\u306b\u9858\u3044\u3092!\n|43\n|Lend Me Your Ears\n|-\n|35\n|\u5973\u6226\u58eb\u30c1\u30eb\u30ab\n|40\n|Jesse's Girl\n|-\n|36\n|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ce\u30fc\u661f\u6551\u51fa\u4f5c\u6226\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|37 \n|50%\u306e\u8ced\u3051\n|38 \n|April Rides\n|-\n|38\n|\u308f\u3093\u3071\u304fWARS\uff01\n|39\n|The Walls Of Red Wing\n|-\n|39\n|\u9b54\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u661f\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\n|33\n|Sneaky Spies\n|-\n|40 \n|\u771f\u5fc3\u304c\u898b\u3048\u305f\u6642\n|32 \n|Snowcone\n|-\n|41 \n|\u6050\u7adc\u306e\u661f\n|11\n|Oh Boy!

In order to protect the colonies and maintain law and order in the solar system, the Earth Federation Government (EFG) was created. Soon, many settlers started to resent the EFG and its sphere of influence, straining the relationship between the central government and the colonies.\n\nWhile a strained peace was being forged between Earth and the colonies, a race of non-human creatures known as Deathcula invaded the System in 2084. Without provocation, they attacked the colonies and killed many of the colonists. The EFG quickly realized that the Deathcula were technologically superior and their forces were hopelessly outmatched.

He is also an outrageous flirt, making mostly unsuccessful passes at nearly every woman he meets.\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Kazuhiko Inoue]]}}\n\n;Marianne Louvre\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Star Sheriffs April.jpg|thumb|200px|Marianne Louvre]] -->\nMarianne Louvre is the 15-year-old daughter of Professor Charles Louvre, is of [[France|French]] nationality and is the engineer who led the construction of the ''Bismarck''. A computer genius, Marianne was the chief envoy from the colonies to Earth. When the Deathcula attack, she calls on the colonies to join the EFG. During this meeting between the colony leaders, Marianne is chosen to join the ''Bismarck'' team, much to the pleasure of her father. Marianne is very technically minded, and most often helps her teammates from her station aboard the Bismarck. A brave girl, she's normally quite repulsed with the idea of killing anyone, even Deathcula. Marianne and Shinji have known each other since childhood, and soon become romantically involved.\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Chie K\u014djiro]]}}\n\n;Charles Louvre\nProfessor Charles Louvre is a scientist on Ganymede, and the father of Marianne Louvre. A well-respected politician, he founded the ''Bismarck Team'' during the second Deathcula attack in order to fight the Deathcula, and decided to use the most powerful arm of the EFG, the ''Bismarck'' robot, to defend the area around [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Louvre personally chooses Shinji Hikari as team leader.\n\n''Voiced by:'' [[Hiroshi Ito (voice actor)|Hiroshi Ito]]\n\n=== Deathcula ===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Deathcula'''|\u30c7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u661f\u4eba|Desukyura-seijin|lit. \"Inhabitants of Planet Deathcula\"}} are aliens who, after destroying their own planet in an internal war, transferred on the planet Metheus. Unfortunately, this planet was also dying, so the Deathcula chose to leave it and conquer the Solar System. Their technology is quite advanced, and their society is one of discipline and obedience. Physically Deathcula look and act like humans, except that they have pointed ears and canine teeth. Due to this similarity, Deathcula are easily able to infiltrate and imitate humans.\n\n;Hyuza\nHyuza is the [[chancellor]] of the Deathcula, and is a tall, frightening cyborg with a demonic death mask for a face. Hyuza lost his body in the battle of Saturn 15 years ago, when Shinji's father destroyed his spacecraft. He transferred his brain in the main computer of ''Hell\u2019s Paradise'', and then connected it to a mechanical body, becoming a cyborg. Cold and cunning, Hyuza wishes revenge toward humans so badly that he chooses as one of his plans the idea to smash ''Hell\u2019s Paradise'' into Earth, even if this means killing himself and his people as well. His most trusted commanders are Perios and Gustav, but nevertheless Hyuza keeps them under tight control.\n{{Voiced by|[[Seiz\u014d Kat\u014d]]}}\n\n;General Perios\nPerios is called from Andromeda by Hyuza himself, becoming Hyuza's most trusted subordinate. Perios is a cold, self-centered strategist, is a great pilot and sharpshooter, and is good at manipulating others. He is extremely ambitious, fears no one and is overly tenacious. During the war, Perios become Bill's most dangerous rival.\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Hirotaka Suzuoki]]}}\n\n;General Zatola\nZatola wears a grotesque helmet, and as one of the main rivals of the Bismarck Team is the commander who orchestrates the Ganymede invasion. He receives legions of soldiers for battle, and his directives come from Hyuza himself. On occasion he can be seen infiltrating the human colonies. He seems to fear Hyuza, but is also quite loyal to him.\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Banj\u014d Ginga]]}}\n\n==Songs==\n; Opening theme: {{nihongo|\"Mystery CALL ME\"|\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70CALL ME|Fushigi CALL ME}} by [[MIQ|MIO]]\n\n; Ending theme: {{nihongo|\"Galaxy Dream\"|\u5922\u9280\u6cb3|Yume Ginga}} by [[MIQ|MIO]]\n\n== Adaptation ==\n{{main|Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs}}\n\nWhen purchased by WEP in 1986, the studio reorganized and rewrote the series, and incorporated six newly written and animated episodes into the original Bismarck story before releasing it in 1987 under the name ''[[Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs]]''. Saber Rider ran for 52 episodes between 1987 and 1988.\n\nIn ''Saber Rider'', the majority of the action is moved out of the solar system and into the rest of the galaxy. As opposed to a private group of four, the characters were written to be a small portion of a major military enforcement group known as the Star Sheriffs. Scenes of the main characters relaxing at a night club or bar and drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] were explained as \"visiting a [[soda shop]]\". Also, since showing death on American cartoons was much less accepted at that time, the '''Outriders''' were shown to \"jump\" back to their own dimension when defeated.\n \nShinji\u2019s name was changed to '''Fireball''', and he had a crush on April Eagle (Marianne). Richard\u2019s name was changed to the titular '''Saber Rider'''. Bill became '''Colt''' and was part of a traveling rodeo until tragedy struck, after which he joined the Star Sheriffs. Marianne was renamed '''April Eagle''', and became a former tennis pro whose three love interests were Saber Rider, Jesse Blue, and Fireball. Professor Charles Louvre was renamed '''Commander Eagle''', and was the leader of Cavalry Command and the Star Sheriffs.\n\nThe Deathcula became '''The Outriders'''. In the new storyline, the Outriders were humanoids who come from another dimension called the Vapor Zone. They wanted to conquer mankind and control the universe unhindered, thinking the human dimension has much more to offer than their own. When an Outrider was shot or wounded, they did not die, but rather \"dimension jump\", a process where they vanish and return to their home dimension to reform.\n\nHyuza was given the name '''Nemesis''', and his story was altered so that he was the evil genius in charge of the renegade Outriders and the mastermind behind their insidious schemes. Perios became '''Jesse Blue''', a promising cadet at Cavalry Command until he fell in love with April Eagle during a training exercise. When April rejected his advances, he turned against the Star Sheriffs and cultivated a personal grudge against Saber Rider, ultimately becoming a fugitive, and joining forces with the Outriders. Zatola was known as '''Gattler'''.\n\nThe American animation used for the extra six episodes of ''Saber Rider'' was visibly different from the Japanese animation. Though the basic character designs remained the same, the style was vastly different from the original character art by [[Shigeru Kato]]. These new episodes were made to help enforce the changes made to the series, such as enforcing the \"Western\" theme with Cowboys and Indians, expanding on the Cavalry Command military structure, as well as showing visual evidence of Outriders reforming in their home dimension.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!Star Musketeer Bismark\n!\n![[Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs]]\n|-\n|1\n|\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u5192\u967a\u91ce\u90ce\n|1\n|Star Sheriff Round Up\n|-\n|2\n|\u4ffa\u3068\u3042\u3044\u3064\u3068\u3042\u306e\u91ce\u90ce\n|4\n|Iguana Get To Know You\n|-\n|3\n|\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u540d\u4fdd\u5b89\u5b98\n|7\n|Little Pardner\n|-\n|4 \n|\u30c7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u6483\u3066\uff01\n|8\n|Brawling Is My Calling\n|-\n|5\n|\u6fc0\u7a81\uff01\uff01 \u8352\u91ce\u306e\u6c7a\u6226\n|16\n|Show Down At Cimarron Pass\n|-\n|6 \n|\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u30a8\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n|19 \n|Sole Survivor\n|-\n|7\n|\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u611b\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\n|20\n|Legend Of The Santa Fe Express\n|-\n|8 \n|\u8b0e\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\n|9\n|Wild Horses Couldn't Drag Me Away\n|-\n|9\n|\u660e\u65e5\u3078\u306e\u6226\u3044\n|27\n|The Hole In The Wall Gang\n|-\n|10 \n|\u30ac\u30cb\u30e1\u30c7\u306e\u9b3c\u5c06\u8ecd \n|22 \n|Famous Last Words\n|-\n|11 \n|\u8001\u3044\u305f\u308b\u4e0d\u6b7b\u9ce5 \n|23 \n|Sharpshooter\n|-\n|12 \n|\u661f\u7a7a\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30ab\u30ed\u30eb\n|24  \n|The Monarch Supreme\n|-\n|13\n|\u6b7b\u795e\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\n|21\n|Snake Eyes\n|-\n|14 \n|\u767d\u9280\u306e\u6c7a\u95d8\n|29\n|Snow-Blind\n|-\n|15 \n|\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\n|5\n|Little Hombre\n|-\n|16\n|\u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u308b\u9a0e\u58eb\u9053\n|10\n|The Castle Of The Mountain Haze\n|-\n|17 \n|\u541b\u306e\u624b\u3067\u6751\u3092\u5b88\u308c\n|30 \n|Tranquility\n|-\n|18 \n|\u5730\u7344\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305f\u8056\u8005\n|41\n|The Amazing Lazardo\n|-\n|19 \n|\u79d8\u5bc6\u6697\u6bba\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u66b4\u3051\n|42\n|I Forgot\n|-\n|20\n|\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6765\u8a2a\u8005\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|21 \n|\u6050\u6016\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\n|6\n|Greatest Show On The New Frontier\n|-\n|22 \n|\u7206\u767a\uff01\uff01 \u6b7b\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9 \n|28\n|The All Galaxy Grand Prix\n|-\n|23\n|\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c6\u30f3\u30fb\u30db\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|24 \n|\u56db\u3064\u8449\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\n|12 \n|Four Leaf Clover\n|-\n|25\n|\u731b\u6483\uff01 \u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\n|37\n|Born on the Bayou\n|-\n|26 \n|\u30ac\u30cb\u30e1\u30c7\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6c7a\u6226\n|25\n|Gattler's Last Stand\n|-\n|27 \n|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6c7a\u610f ACT-1\n|35\n|The Challenge (1)\n|-\n|28 \n|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6c7a\u610f ACT-2\n|36\n|The Challenge (2)\n|-\n|29\n|\u518d\u4f1a\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\n|14\n|What Did You Do On Your Summer Vacation?\n|-\n|30\n|\u6226\u3048\uff01 \u5e73\u548c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|31 \n|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30e1\u30c0\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305f\u7537\n|15\n|Jesse Blue\n|-\n|32\n|\u30c7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u30fb\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\n|26\n|Dooley\n|-\n|33 \n|\u5e7d\u970a\u6226\u968a\u3092\u53e9\u3051\uff01\n|31\n|Bad Day At Dry Gulch\n|-\n|34\n|\u8679\u306b\u9858\u3044\u3092!\n|43\n|Lend Me Your Ears\n|-\n|35\n|\u5973\u6226\u58eb\u30c1\u30eb\u30ab\n|40\n|Jesse\u2019s Girl\n|-\n|36\n|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ce\u30fc\u661f\u6551\u51fa\u4f5c\u6226\n| X\n| \u2014\n|-\n|37 \n|50%\u306e\u8ced\u3051\n|38 \n|April Rides\n|-\n|38\n|\u308f\u3093\u3071\u304fWARS\uff01\n|39\n|The Walls Of Red Wing\n|-\n|39\n|\u9b54\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u661f\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\n|33\n|Sneaky Spies\n|-\n|40 \n|\u771f\u5fc3\u304c\u898b\u3048\u305f\u6642\n|32 \n|Snowcone\n|-\n|41 \n|\u6050\u7adc\u306e\u661f\n|11\n|Oh Boy!

Since 1979, the event has been staged and managed by Unipublic, until in 2014, when [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] acquired control, with both working together. The [[peloton]] expanded from a primarily Spanish participation to include riders from all over the world. The Vuelta is a [[UCI World Tour]] event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly [[UCI WorldTeam]]s, with the exception of the [[Wild card (sports)#Road Cycling|wild card]] teams that the organizers can invite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/templates/UCI/UCI2/layout.asp?MenuId=MTUyMjQ |title=Union Cycliste Internationale |publisher=Uci.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=When is the Criterium route announced. |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/530629/uci-worldtour-calendar-2012.html |title=UCI WorldTour calendar 2012 &#124; Latest News |magazine=Cycling Weekly |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia, the Vuelta makes up cycling's prestigious, three-week-long [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=features/2007/abu_dhabi07 |title=Million dollar, baby! |work=Cycling News |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of at least two time trials, the passage through the mountain chain of the [[Pyrenees]], and the finish in the Spanish capital [[Madrid]]. The modern editions of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period that includes 2 rest days.\n\nAll of the stages are timed to the finish, after finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the [[List of Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a general classification winners|red jersey]]. While the general classification garners the most attention there are other contests held within the Vuelta: the [[Points classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|points classification]] for the sprinters, the [[Mountains classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|mountains classification]] for the climbers, [[Combination classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|combination classification]] for the all-round riders, and the [[team classification]] for the competing teams.\n\n==History==\nFirst held in [[1935 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1935]] and annually since [[1955 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1955]], the Vuelta runs for three weeks in a changing route across Spain. The inaugural event (1935) saw 50 entrants face a 3,411&nbsp;km (2,119&nbsp;mi.) course over only 14 stages, averaging over 240&nbsp;km (149&nbsp;mi.) per stage.  It was inspired by the success of the Tours in France and Italy, and the boost they brought to the circulations of their sponsoring newspapers (''[[L'\u00c9quipe|L'Auto]]'' and ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' respectively); Juan Pujol of the daily ''Informaciones'' instigated the race to increase its circulation.\n\nIt was originally held in the spring, usually late April, with a few editions held in June in the 1940s. In [[1995 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1995]], however, the race moved to September to avoid direct competition with the [[Giro d'Italia]], held in May. As a result, the Vuelta is now often seen as an important preparation for the [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championships]], which moved to October the same year. A Vuelta was also organized in August and September 1950.\n[[Image:1vueltaespana.jpg|thumb|The daily ''Informaciones'' with information about the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a first edition]]\n\nTypically, the course includes up to three time trials, and a number of mountain stages.  Since 1994, and often before (such as in the inaugural edition), the Vuelta finished in the Spanish capital, Madrid, although [[Bilbao]] (in the 1950s) and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (in the 1970s) were long both recurring finish cities. Behind Madrid, three cities share second place for the most Vuelta departures: [[Gij\u00f3n]], Bilbao, and one time finish city [[Jerez de la Frontera]]. In 1997, the Vuelta started abroad for the first time, in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. The first ever Vuelta to start outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] took place in 2009, when the Dutch city of [[Assen]] hosted the prologue of the [[2009 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|64th Vuelta]].\n\nIn [[1999 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1999]], for the first time, the course crossed the [[Alto de L'Angliru]] in [[Asturias]], which climbs 1,573 meters (5,160 feet) over 12.9&nbsp;km (8&nbsp;mi.) with grades as steep as 23.6 percent (at ''Cue\u00f1a-les-Cabres''), making it one of the steepest climbs in Europe.  Credit for the discovery of this climb and its addition to the Vuelta goes to Miguel Prieto.\n\nThe overall leader at present wears a red jersey, although previously it has been the \"Maillot amarillo\" (Yellow jersey) and the \"Jersey de Oro\" ([[Golden jersey]])\u2014 the Spanish counterpart to the [[yellow jersey]] of the Tour de France. Other jerseys honor the best climber ([[King of the Mountains]], awarded a blue-on-white polka dot jersey) and leader of the [[points classification|points competition]] (for many years awarded a ''blue with yellow fish jersey'' sponsored by Spain's fishing and marine industry, but more recently given a green jersey).<ref name=jerseys /> Usually, other [[cycling jersey]]s are awarded, such as for points leaders in the \"''Metas Volantes''\" (intermediate sprints) and for the combination category (a point system that honors the best rider with the combined total points in the best overall, points and mountains classifications).\n\nThe record for most wins is held by [[Roberto Heras]] of Spain, winner in [[2000 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2000]], [[2003 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2003]], [[2004 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2004]] and [[2005 Vuelta a Espana|2005]].  Spaniards have dominated, winning 30 of the 66 runnings of the Vuelta. France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Colombia, Ireland, Russia, Kazakhstan, the United States and Great Britain have also had first-place finishers.\n\n===1934\u20131936===\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 1em; clear:right;\">{{Timeline Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a Winners}}</div>\nThe first races were run at the national level and were promoted by the bicycle manufacturers from [[Eibar]]. Consequently, the tour was Eibar&nbsp;\u2013 Madrid&nbsp;\u2013 Eibar, and called the Grand Prix of the Republic.\n\n===1935\u20131960===\n\nIn the early 1935, former cyclist Clemente L\u00f3pez Doriga, in collaboration with Juan Pujol, director of the daily newspaper ''Informaciones'', organized the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a,<ref name=pc>{{cite web |url=http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/1/7/1920607/vuelta-fables-the-basque-issue |title=Vuelta Fables: The Basque Issue |last1=McKay |first1=Fergal |date=7 January 2011 |website=podiumcafe.com |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> with a distance 3431&nbsp;km, in a total of 14 stages. The first stage took the riders from Madrid&nbsp;to [[Valladolid]]. That year saw the first great duel in the history of the Vuelta, between Belgium's [[Gustaaf Deloor]], who ultimately won, and [[Mariano Ca\u00f1ardo]], Spanish runner-up. The second edition of the Vuelta, finally held despite the delicate political situation, was also marked by the Deeloor repeat, who this time held the lead from the first day to the last. After the first two editions, the Spanish race suffered a hiatus because of the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nIn [[1941 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1941]], the Vuelta resumed competition with an almost entirely Spanish peloton and very little foreign representation. That year the first time trial was held in the Vuelta. [[Julian Berrendero]] was proclaimed the winner, and he recaptured the title the next year. In addition, Berrendero was King of the Mountains for three consecutive years.\n\nWith World War II and the precarious economic situation, there was another break in the running of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 1945, the Journal took over organization of the race and competition resumed, although again with few foreign competitors in the peloton. On this occasion, [[Delio Rodriguez]] took the final victory. That year also introduced the points classification, but this was not stable until 1955. Four editions were run until 1950.\n\nSubsequently, there was no Vuelta until 1955, when it was organized by the Basque newspaper ''[[El Correo|El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco]]''.<ref name=pc /> Since then, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a has been run annually. At this time, the Vuelta was run routinely in April and May, while previously it was held variably between April and August. Another difference was the number of participants. Previously, there were very few, but the number doubled, with more internationally recognized competitors.\n\n===1960\u20131970===\n\nThe prestige of the Vuelta increased, with more stars from the international cycling scene. During the late 1950s came the first successes in the overall standings of Italian and French riders. In the 1960s, they would also be joined by German and Dutch riders. In [[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]], [[Jacques Anquetil]] won the general classification, establishing himself as the first rider to win all three Grand Tours. Five years later, in [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]], [[Felice Gimondi]] would do the same. [[Eddy Merckx]] ([[1973 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1973]]), [[Bernard Hinault]] ([[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1978]], [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1983]]), [[Alberto Contador]] ([[2008 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2008]]), and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ([[2010 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2010]]) later accomplished the same treble.\n\n[[Antonio Karmany]] dominated the mountain classification for three consecutive years, then was replaced by Julio Jimenez, who won it for another three years.\n\nIn [[1965 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1965]], [[Rik Van Looy]] became the first rider to repeat victory in the points classification. [[Jan Janssen]] in [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]] and [[1974 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1974]] [[Domingo Perurena]] would do the same, winning this classification twice.\n\nDuring mid 60's the organizer of the Vuelta, ''El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco'', went through some financial problems that endangered the running of the competition. However, during that time all editions ended normally. In [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]], the Vuelta was hit by a terrorist attack and other events, having to cancel the 15th stage. There were no fatalities.\n\n===1970\u20131980===\n\nThe '70s began with the triumph of [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], who was already established in the international squad as one of the greats of cycling.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fuente]], with victories in [[1972 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1972]] and [[1974 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1974]], became the third rider to win two Tours of Spain. A few years later, Bernard Hinault repeated the feat, which was also achieved by Pedro Delgado during the 1980s.\n\nIn [[1973 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1973]], [[Eddy Merckx]] managed to win the Vuelta and he did so with a landslide, winning six stages and all individual classifications with the exception of the mountains competition: he finished second.\n\n[[Freddy Maertens]] in [[1977 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1977]] echoed a similar domination to that demonstrated by Merckx a few years earlier, by winning thirteen stages and all individual classifications except the mountain.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Andres Oliva managed to earn the King of the Mountains title in three editions of the Vuelta.\n\nFrenchman [[Bernard Hinault]] emerged in 1978 as an international cycling star. The same year, Hinault won his first Tour de France. The last stage of that edition also had to be suspended because of riots and barricades that prevented the normal course of it.<ref name=pc />\n\nWhen 1979 ''El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco'' left as a sponsor of the race, the Vuelta was once again endangered. However, the company Unipublic took charge of the competition. This, coupled with increased advertising and the beginning of the broadcasts via television, further grew revenue and interest in the Vuelta.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\n\nIn the early 1980s, two names stood out in the secondary classifications: Jos\u00e9 Luis Lagu\u00eda, who won the mountain classification five times, and Sean Kelly, who won four times in the points classification.\n\nIn [[1982 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1982]] came the first case of disqualification of the winner for doping. Two days after the end of the competition, [[\u00c1ngel Arroyo]] and a few other riders were disqualified, and Arroyo lost his victory to [[Marino Lejarreta]]. Arroyo appealed for a B test of his sample, which again tested positive. Arroyo was given a ten-minute penalty, and ultimately ended up placing thirteenth in the general classification.\n\nNext year's edition was the first appearance of the [[Lagos de Covadonga]] as a final stage, an ascent that would become, over the years, the most iconic climb of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. In [[1984 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1984]] it played the issue in a race that ended with the smallest difference between the first and second place. [[Eric Caritoux]], a complete unknown until then, managed to win the Vuelta with only six seconds ahead of [[Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco|Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez]] in second place.\n\nThe end of the 80s was marked by the rise of Colombian cycling, which presented a strong challenge particularly in the mountain stages. Names such as [[Lucho Herrera]] (winner in [[1987 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1987]]) or [[Fabio Parra]] (2nd in [[1989 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1989]]) appeared in the last editions of the decade. One of the rulers at that time was also [[Pedro Delgado]], with two victories ([[1985 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1985]] and [[1989 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1989]]), a second place, and two third-place finishes.\n\n===1990\u20132000===\n\nThe first half of the 1990s was marked by the dominance of Swiss rider [[Tony Rominger]], the first rider to win three times and win the race consecutively between 1992 and 1994.\n\nThe fiftieth edition of the Vuelta, which was held in [[1995 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1995]], coincided with the change of dates. The Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a came to be held in September, and near the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|author=Andrew Hood|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/05/news/the-giro-tour-double-cyclings-elusive-feat_284617|title=The Giro-Tour double: Cycling\u2019s elusive feat|date=13 May 2013|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> That year [[Laurent Jalabert]] won all classifications, the second time this happened in the Vuelta (Rominger had done so in 1993). The Frenchman was also a four-time winner of the points classification, matching the previous record set by Kelly in the '80s.\n\nIn [[1997 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1997]], the tour started for the first time in a foreign country. They began in [[Lisbon]], on the occasion of [[Expo '98]].\n\nThe ascent of the [[Alto de L'Angliru]] was part of a stage for the first time in 1999, with the victory of [[Jose Maria Jimenez]], four-time winner of the mountains classification. The reputation of the climb grew rapidly because of its demanding nature.\n\n===2000\u20132010===\nThe first editions of the 2000s were marked by the dominance of [[Roberto Heras]], who achieved victory on three occasions, and in [[2005 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2005]] did it for the fourth time. However, as happened with [[\u00c1ngel Arroyo]] in 1982, Heras was disqualified days after the end of the competition after testing positive in a doping test, this time for use of [[Erythropoietin|EPO]]. This positive development was later ratified by the counter-analysis and Heras was stripped of his title, benefiting the Russian cyclist [[Denis Menchov]] until 2012, when the Spanish Courts overturned the positive test and re-awarded the win to Heras. In 2006 [[Alexander Vinokourov]] won after a struggle with the then leader of the [[UCI Pro Tour]], [[Alejandro Valverde]]. In the 2007 edition [[Denis Menchov]] again clinched the overall victory by more than three minutes over the Spanish cyclists [[Carlos Sastre]] and [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]]. In June 2008, French company [[Amaury Sport Organisation]], who organize the [[Tour de France]], announced it had bought 49% of Unipublic.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|title=Tour de France owners ASO take full control of Vuelta|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/amaury-sports-organization-buys-vuelta-stake-16840/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=BikeRadar|publisher=|date=6 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the winner was the Spaniard Alberto Contador, who also won that year's Giro d'Italia, and became the first Spaniard to win all three Grand Tours. In 2009, the Vuelta began in Drenthe, Netherlands, continuing through Belgium and Germany. The final winner was Alejandro Valverde, who adopted a conservative stance without winning any stage and sprinting in the final meters to achieve bonuses. His main rivals were Samuel Sanchez (second place), [[Cadel Evans]] (third), [[Ivan Basso]], [[Robert Gesink]] and [[Ezequiel Mosquera]].  All of them suffered critical falls or punctures such as Evans in Monachil.\n\n===2010\u2013Present===\n[[File:Stage 21 of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a 2013 in Madrid, Spain, September 15, 2013.jpg|thumb|The 21st and final stage of the [[2013 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] on [[Paseo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].]]\nAfter [[Vincenzo Nibali]] won in 2010 he was unable to defend his title in 2011.

The color of the leader's jersey of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a has changed several times since the original tour. The organizers who revived the Vuelta following its multiple suspensions since 1936 usually changed the color of the jersey. The leader's jersey began as orange in 1935, became white in 1941, then back to orange in 1942.  It was white with a horizontal red stripe from 1945\u20131950. In 1955, when ''[[El Correo]]'' resurrected the Vuelta, yellow became the color of the leader's jersey, the same color as in the Tour de France. Except for the 1977 Vuelta, when the jersey was orange, a yellow jersey was worn until 1998, when the color was deepened to a gold hue. However, for the 2010 edition, the colour of the leader's jersey was changed to red.<ref name=jerseys>{{cite encyclopedia\n|last=Mallon\n|first=Bill\n|authorlink=Bill Mallon\n|last2=Heijmans\n|first2=Jeroen\n|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Cycling\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrdfuueq2CcC&pg=PA228\n|accessdate=18 April 2014\n|year=2011\n|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]\n|location=Lanham, Maryland\n|isbn=9780810873698\n|page=228\n}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1950 Vuelta, the leaders of the other race classifications have been permitted to wear identifying jerseys (previously, there was an official mountain classification, but no identifying jersey). For a long time, a blue jersey identified the leader of the points classification, green the leader of the mountain classification, and red the leader of the sprints classification. Recently, these other classifications have used jerseys more like those used at the Tour de France, with the points leader using a green jersey, and the King of the Mountains using a polka dot jersey

race|multi-stage]] [[bicycle racing|bicycle race]] primarily held in [[Spain]], while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. Inspired by the success of the [[Giro d'Italia]] and the [[Tour de France]], the race was first organized in [[1935 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1935]].<ref name=\"cyclingrevealed1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/Sept06/Vuelta/VaEhistory06.htm |title=Cycling Revealed |publisher=Cycling Revealed |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref>  The race was prevented from being run by the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]] in the early years of its existence; however, the race has been held annually since [[1955 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1955]].<ref name=\"cyclingrevealed1\"/> As the Vuelta gained prestige and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend all around the globe. Since 1979, the event has been staged and managed by Unipublic, until in 2014, when [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] acquired control, with both working together. The [[peloton]] expanded from a primarily Spanish participation to include riders from all over the world. The Vuelta is a [[UCI World Tour]] event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly [[UCI WorldTeam]]s, with the exception of the [[Wild card (sports)#Road Cycling|wild card]] teams that the organizers can invite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/templates/UCI/UCI2/layout.asp?MenuId=MTUyMjQ |title=Union Cycliste Internationale |publisher=Uci.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=When is the Criterium route announced. |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/530629/uci-worldtour-calendar-2012.html |title=UCI WorldTour calendar 2012 &#124; Latest News |magazine=Cycling Weekly |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia, the Vuelta makes up cycling's prestigious, three-week-long [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=features/2007/abu_dhabi07 |title=Million dollar, baby! |work=Cycling News |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of at least two time trials, the passage through the mountain chain of the [[Pyrenees]], and the finish in the Spanish capital [[Madrid]]. The modern editions of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period that includes 2 rest days.\n\nAll of the stages are timed to the finish, after finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the [[List of Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a general classification winners|red jersey]]. While the general classification garners the most attention there are other contests held within the Vuelta: the [[Points classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|points classification]] for the sprinters, the [[Mountains classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|mountains classification]] for the climbers, [[Combination classification in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|combination classification]] for the all-round riders, and the [[team classification]] for the competing teams.\n\n==History==\nFirst held in [[1935 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1935]] and annually since [[1955 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1955]], the Vuelta runs for three weeks in a changing route across Spain. The inaugural event (1935) saw 50 entrants face a 3,411&nbsp;km (2,119&nbsp;mi.) course over only 14 stages, averaging over 240&nbsp;km (149&nbsp;mi.) per stage.  It was inspired by the success of the Tours in France and Italy, and the boost they brought to the circulations of their sponsoring newspapers (''[[L'\u00c9quipe|L'Auto]]'' and ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' respectively); Juan Pujol of the daily ''Informaciones'' instigated the race to increase its circulation.\n\nIt was originally held in the spring, usually late April, with a few editions held in June in the 1940s. In [[1995 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1995]], however, the race moved to September to avoid direct competition with the [[Giro d'Italia]], held in May. As a result, the Vuelta is now often seen as an important preparation for the [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championships]], which moved to October the same year. A Vuelta was also organized in August and September 1950.\n[[Image:1vueltaespana.jpg|thumb|The daily ''Informaciones'' with information about the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a first edition]]\n\nTypically, the course includes up to three time trials, and a number of mountain stages.  Since 1994, and often before (such as in the inaugural edition), the Vuelta finished in the Spanish capital, Madrid, although [[Bilbao]] (in the 1950s) and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (in the 1970s) were long both recurring finish cities. Behind Madrid, three cities share second place for the most Vuelta departures: [[Gij\u00f3n]], Bilbao, and one time finish city [[Jerez de la Frontera]]. In 1997, the Vuelta started abroad for the first time, in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. The first ever Vuelta to start outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] took place in 2009, when the Dutch city of [[Assen]] hosted the prologue of the [[2009 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|64th Vuelta]].\n\nIn [[1999 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1999]], for the first time, the course crossed the [[Alto de L'Angliru]] in [[Asturias]], which climbs 1,573 meters (5,160 feet) over 12.9&nbsp;km (8&nbsp;mi.) with grades as steep as 23.6 percent (at ''Cue\u00f1a-les-Cabres''), making it one of the steepest climbs in Europe.  Credit for the discovery of this climb and its addition to the Vuelta goes to Miguel Prieto.\n\nThe overall leader at present wears a red jersey, although previously it has been the \"Maillot amarillo\" (Yellow jersey) and the \"Jersey de Oro\" ([[Golden jersey]])\u2014 the Spanish counterpart to the [[yellow jersey]] of the Tour de France. Other jerseys honor the best climber ([[King of the Mountains]], awarded a blue-on-white polka dot jersey) and leader of the [[points classification|points competition]] (for many years awarded a ''blue with yellow fish jersey'' sponsored by Spain's fishing and marine industry, but more recently given a green jersey).<ref name=jerseys /> Usually, other [[cycling jersey]]s are awarded, such as for points leaders in the \"''Metas Volantes''\" (intermediate sprints) and for the combination category (a point system that honors the best rider with the combined total points in the best overall, points and mountains classifications).\n\nThe record for most wins is held by [[Roberto Heras]] of Spain, winner in [[2000 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2000]], [[2003 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2003]], [[2004 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2004]] and [[2005 Vuelta a Espana|2005]].  Spaniards have dominated, winning 30 of the 66 runnings of the Vuelta. France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Colombia, Ireland, Russia, Kazakhstan, the United States and Great Britain have also had first-place finishers.\n\n===1934\u20131936===\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 1em; clear:right;\">{{Timeline Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a Winners}}</div>\nThe first races were run at the national level and were promoted by the bicycle manufacturers from [[Eibar]]. Consequently, the tour was Eibar&nbsp;\u2013 Madrid&nbsp;\u2013 Eibar, and called the Grand Prix of the Republic.\n\n===1935\u20131960===\n\nIn the early 1935, former cyclist Clemente Lopez Doriga, in collaboration with Juan Pujol, director of the daily newspaper ''Informaciones'', organized the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a,<ref name=pc>{{cite web |url=http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/1/7/1920607/vuelta-fables-the-basque-issue |title=Vuelta Fables: The Basque Issue |last1=McKay |first1=Fergal |date=7 January 2011 |website=podiumcafe.com |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> with a distance 3431&nbsp;km, in a total of 14 stages. The first stage took the riders from Madrid&nbsp;to [[Valladolid]]. That year saw the first great duel in the history of the Vuelta, between Belgium's [[Gustaaf Deloor]], who ultimately won, and [[Mariano Ca\u00f1ardo]], Spanish runner-up. The second edition of the Vuelta, finally held despite the delicate political situation, was also marked by the Deeloor repeat, who this time held the lead from the first day to the last. After the first two editions, the Spanish race suffered a hiatus because of the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nIn [[1941 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1941]], the Vuelta resumed competition with an almost entirely Spanish peloton and very little foreign representation. That year the first time trial was held in the Vuelta. [[Julian Berrendero]] was proclaimed the winner, and he recaptured the title the next year. In addition, Berrendero was King of the Mountains for three consecutive years.\n\nWith World War II and the precarious economic situation, there was another break in the running of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 1945, the Journal took over organization of the race and competition resumed, although again with few foreign competitors in the peloton. On this occasion, [[Delio Rodriguez]] took the final victory. That year also introduced the points classification, but this was not stable until 1955. Four editions were run until 1950.\n\nSubsequently, there was no Vuelta until 1955, when it was organized by the Basque newspaper ''[[El Correo|El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco]]''.<ref name=pc /> Since then, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a has been run annually. At this time, the Vuelta was run routinely in April and May, while previously it was held variably between April and August. Another difference was the number of participants. Previously, there were very few, but the number doubled, with more internationally recognized competitors.\n\n===1960\u20131970===\n\nThe prestige of the Vuelta increased, with more stars from the international cycling scene. During the late 1950s came the first successes in the overall standings of Italian and French riders. In the 1960s, they would also be joined by German and Dutch riders. In [[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]], [[Jacques Anquetil]] won the general classification, establishing himself as the first rider to win all three Grand Tours. Five years later, in [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]], [[Felice Gimondi]] would do the same. [[Eddy Merckx]] ([[1973 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1973]]), [[Bernard Hinault]] ([[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1978]], [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1983]]), [[Alberto Contador]] ([[2008 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2008]]), and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ([[2010 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2010]]) later accomplished the same treble.\n\n[[Antonio Karmany]] dominated the mountain classification for three consecutive years, then was replaced by Julio Jimenez, who won it for another three years.\n\nIn [[1965 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1965]], [[Rik Van Looy]] became the first rider to repeat victory in the points classification. [[Jan Janssen]] in [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]] and [[1974 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1974]] [[Domingo Perurena]] would do the same, winning this classification twice.\n\nDuring mid 60's the organizer of the Vuelta, ''El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco'', went through some financial problems that endangered the running of the competition. However, during that time all editions ended normally. In [[1968 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1968]], the Vuelta was hit by a terrorist attack and other events, having to cancel the 15th stage. There were no fatalities.\n\n===1970\u20131980===\n\nThe '70s began with the triumph of [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], who was already established in the international squad as one of the greats of cycling.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fuente]], with victories in [[1972 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1972]] and [[1974 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1974]], became the third rider to win two Tours of Spain. A few years later, Bernard Hinault repeated the feat, which was also achieved by Pedro Delgado during the 1980s.\n\nIn [[1973 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1973]], [[Eddy Merckx]] managed to win the Vuelta and he did so with a landslide, winning six stages and all individual classifications with the exception of the mountains competition: he finished second.\n\n[[Freddy Maertens]] in [[1977 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1977]] echoed a similar domination to that demonstrated by Merckx a few years earlier, by winning thirteen stages and all individual classifications except the mountain.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Andres Oliva managed to earn the King of the Mountains title in three editions of the Vuelta.\n\nFrenchman [[Bernard Hinault]] emerged in 1978 as an international cycling star. The same year, Hinault won his first Tour de France. The last stage of that edition also had to be suspended because of riots and barricades that prevented the normal course of it.<ref name=pc />\n\nWhen 1979 ''El Correo Espa\u00f1ol-El Pueblo Vasco'' left as a sponsor of the race, the Vuelta was once again endangered. However, the company Unipublic took charge of the competition. This, coupled with increased advertising and the beginning of the broadcasts via television, further grew revenue and interest in the Vuelta.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\n\nIn the early 1980s, two names stood out in the secondary classifications: Jos\u00e9 Luis Lagu\u00eda, who won the mountain classification five times, and Sean Kelly, who won four times in the points classification.\n\nIn [[1982 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1982]] came the first case of disqualification of the winner for doping. Two days after the end of the competition, [[\u00c1ngel Arroyo]] and a few other riders were disqualified, and Arroyo lost his victory to [[Marino Lejarreta]]. Arroyo appealed for a B test of his sample, which again tested positive. Arroyo was given a ten-minute penalty, and ultimately ended up placing thirteenth in the general classification.\n\nNext year's edition was the first appearance of the [[Lagos de Covadonga]] as a final stage, an ascent that would become, over the years, the most iconic climb of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. In [[1984 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1984]] it played the issue in a race that ended with the smallest difference between the first and second place. [[Eric Caritoux]], a complete unknown until then, managed to win the Vuelta with only six seconds ahead of [[Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco|Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez]] in second place.\n\nThe end of the 80s was marked by the rise of Colombian cycling, which presented a strong challenge particularly in the mountain stages. Names such as [[Lucho Herrera]] (winner in [[1987 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1987]]) or [[Fabio Parra]] (2nd in [[1989 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1989]]) appeared in the last editions of the decade. One of the rulers at that time was also [[Pedro Delgado]], with two victories ([[1985 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1985]] and [[1989 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1989]]), a second place, and two third-place finishes.\n\n===1990\u20132000===\n\nThe first half of the 1990s was marked by the dominance of Swiss rider [[Tony Rominger]], the first rider to win three times and win the race consecutively between 1992 and 1994.\n\nThe fiftieth edition of the Vuelta, which was held in [[1995 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1995]], coincided with the change of dates. The Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a came to be held in September, and near the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|author=Andrew Hood|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/05/news/the-giro-tour-double-cyclings-elusive-feat_284617|title=The Giro-Tour double: Cycling\u2019s elusive feat|date=13 May 2013|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> That year [[Laurent Jalabert]] won all classifications, the second time this happened in the Vuelta (Rominger had done so in 1993). The Frenchman was also a four-time winner of the points classification, matching the previous record set by Kelly in the '80s.\n\nIn [[1997 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1997]], the tour started for the first time in a foreign country. They began in [[Lisbon]], on the occasion of [[Expo '98]].\n\nThe ascent of the [[Alto de L'Angliru]] was part of a stage for the first time in 1999, with the victory of [[Jose Maria Jimenez]], four-time winner of the mountains classification. The reputation of the climb grew rapidly because of its demanding nature.\n\n===2000\u20132010===\nThe first editions of the 2000s were marked by the dominance of [[Roberto Heras]], who achieved victory on three occasions, and in [[2005 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2005]] did it for the fourth time. However, as happened with [[\u00c1ngel Arroyo]] in 1982, Heras was disqualified days after the end of the competition after testing positive in a doping test, this time for use of [[Erythropoietin|EPO]]. This positive development was later ratified by the counter-analysis and Heras was stripped of his title, benefiting the Russian cyclist [[Denis Menchov]] until 2012, when the Spanish Courts overturned the positive test and re-awarded the win to Heras. In 2006 [[Alexander Vinokourov]] won after a struggle with the then leader of the [[UCI Pro Tour]], [[Alejandro Valverde]]. In the 2007 edition [[Denis Menchov]] again clinched the overall victory by more than three minutes over the Spanish cyclists [[Carlos Sastre]] and [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]]. In June 2008, French company [[Amaury Sport Organisation]], who organize the [[Tour de France]], announced it had bought 49% of Unipublic.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|title=Tour de France owners ASO take full control of Vuelta|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/amaury-sports-organization-buys-vuelta-stake-16840/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=BikeRadar|publisher=|date=6 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the winner was the Spaniard Alberto Contador, who also won that year's Giro d'Italia, and became the first Spaniard to win all three Grand Tours. In 2009, the Vuelta began in Drenthe, Netherlands, continuing through Belgium and Germany. The final winner was Alejandro Valverde, who adopted a conservative stance without winning any stage and sprinting in the final meters to achieve bonuses. His main rivals were Samuel Sanchez (second place), [[Cadel Evans]] (third), [[Ivan Basso]], [[Robert Gesink]] and [[Ezequiel Mosquera]].  All of them suffered critical falls or punctures such as Evans in Monachil.\n\n===2010\u2013Present===\n[[File:Stage 21 of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a 2013 in Madrid, Spain, September 15, 2013.jpg|thumb|The 21st and final stage of the [[2013 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] on [[Paseo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].]]\nAfter [[Vincenzo Nibali]] won in 2010 he was unable to defend his title in 2011.

The color of the leader's jersey of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a has changed several times since the original tour. The organizers who revived the Vuelta following its multiple suspensions since 1936 usually changed the color of the jersey. The leader's jersey began as orange in 1935, became white in 1941, then back to orange in 1942.  It was white with a horizontal red stripe from 1945\u20131950. In 1955, when ''[[El Correo]]'' resurrected the Vuelta, yellow became the color of the leader's jersey, the same color as in the Tour de France. Except for the 1977 Vuelta, when the jersey was orange, a yellow jersey was worn until 1998, when the color was deepened to a gold hue. However, for the 2010 edition, the colour of the leader's jersey was changed to red.<ref name=jerseys>{{cite encyclopedia\n|last=Mallon\n|first=Bill\n|authorlink=Bill Mallon\n|last2=Heijmans\n|first2=Jeroen\n|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Cycling\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrdfuueq2CcC&pg=PA228\n|accessdate=18 April 2014\n|year=2011\n|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]\n|location=Lanham, Maryland\n|isbn=9780810873698\n|page=228\n}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1950 Vuelta, the leaders of the other race classifications have been permitted to wear identifying jerseys (previously, there was an official mountain classification, but no identifying jersey). For a long time, a blue jersey identified the leader of the points classification, green the leader of the mountain classification, and red the leader of the sprints classification. Recently, these other classifications have used jerseys more like those used at the Tour de France, with the points leader using a green jersey, and the King of the Mountains using a polka dot jersey (albeit blue-on-white rather than red-on-white as at the Tour).<ref name=jerseys />\n\n==Stage wins==\n\n===Stage wins per rider===\n\n16 riders have won 10 or more stages.\n\nactive riders are in '''bold '''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Rank\n!Name\n!Country\n!Wins\n|-\n|1 ||  [[Delio Rodr\u00edguez]] || {{flag|ESP}} || 39\n|-\n|2 ||  [[Alessandro Petacchi]] || {{flag|ITA}} || 20\n|-\n|rowspan=2|3 ||  [[Laurent Jalabert]] || {{flag|FRA}} || 18\n|-\n||  [[Rik Van Looy]] || {{flag|BEL}} || 18\n|-\n|5 ||  [[Sean Kelly (cyclist)|Sean Kelly]] || {{flag|IRL}} || 16\n|-\n|6 ||  [[Gerben Karstens]] || {{flag|NED}} || 14\n|-\n|rowspan=2|7  ||  [[Freddy Maertens]] || {{flag|BEL}} || 13\n|-\n|| '''[[Alejandro Valverde]]''' || {{flag|ESP}} || 13\n|-\n|rowspan=2|9 ||  [[Marcel W\u00fcst]] || {{flag|GER}} || 12\n|-\n||  [[Tony Rominger]] || {{flag|SUI}} || 12\n|-\n|rowspan=3|11 ||  [[Domingo Perurena]] || {{flag|ESP}} || 11\n|-\n||  [[Juli\u00e1n Berrendero]] || {{flag|ESP}} || 11\n|-\n||  [[Augustin Tamames]] || {{flag|ESP}} || 11\n|-\n|rowspan=3|14 || '''[[John Degenkolb]]''' ||{{flag|GER}}||10\n|-\n||  [[Roberto Heras]] || {{flag|ESP}} || 10\n|-\n||  [[Eddy Planckaert]] || {{flag|BEL}} || 10\n|}\n\n===Stage wins per country===\n\n{{main|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a records and statistics#Stage wins per country}}\n\n==Records==\n\n* Most Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a victories:  [[Roberto Heras]], 4\n* Most Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a Stage wins:  [[Delio Rodriguez]], 39\n* Most stage wins in one edition:  [[Freddy Maertens]] in [[1977 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1977]], 13\n* Most [[individual time trial]] wins:  [[Abraham Olano]], [[Alex Z\u00fclle]], [[Tony Rominger]] and [[Melcior Mauri]], 6\n* Most number of victories by country:  Spain, 31\n* Most days as leader:  [[Alex Z\u00fclle]], 48\n* Most mountains classification victories:  [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Lagu\u00eda]], 5\n* Most points classification victories:  [[Sean Kelly (cyclist)|Sean Kelly]], [[Laurent Jalabert]] and [[Alejandro Valverde]], 4\n* Most number of intermediate sprints classification victories:  Miguel \u00c1ngel Iglesias, 5\n* Largest margin of victory:  [[Delio Rodriguez]] over [[Juli\u00e1n Berrendero]] in [[1945 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1945]], 30' 8\"\n* Smallest margin of victory:  [[Eric Caritoux]] over [[Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez (cyclist)|Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez]] in [[1984 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1984]], 6 seconds\n* Most participations: [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Cuesta]], 17 (1994-2010).\n* Most consecutive participations: [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Cuesta]], 17 (1994\u20132010).\n* Most Vueltas finished: [[Federico Echave]], 14 (1982\u20131995), and [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Cuesta]], 14 (1994, 1996\u201399, 2001\u201303 and 2005\u201310)\n* Most consecutive Vueltas finished: [[Federico Echave]], 14 (1982\u20131995).\n* Least number of participants:  [[1941 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1941]], 32\n* Greatest number of participants: [[2002 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2002]], 207\n* Fastest average speed:  [[2001 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2001]], 42.534&nbsp;km/h\n* Slowest average speed:  [[1941 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1941]], 26.262&nbsp;km/h\n* Longest edition:  [[1941 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1941]], 4,442&nbsp;km\n* Shortest edition: [[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]], 2,419&nbsp;km\n* Youngest general classification winner: [[Angelino Soler]] in [[1961 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1961]], age {{Age in years and days|1939|11|25|1961|5|11}}\n* Oldest general classification winner: [[Chris Horner]] in [[2013 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|2013]], age {{Age in years and days|1971|10|23|2013|9|15}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cycling archives race|574}}\n* [http://www.sportlistings.com/Road-Cycling/UCI-World-Tour/Vuelta-a-Espana/Vuelta-a-Espana-l1138.html Sportlistings]\n\n{{Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a}}\n{{Grand Tour}}\n{{UCI World Tour}}\n{{Road bicycle racing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vuelta A Espana}}\n[[Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a| ]]\n[[Category:Cycle races in Spain|1]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1935]]\n[[Category:UCI ProTour races]]\n[[Category:UCI World Tour races]]\n[[Category:1935 establishments in Spain]]\n[[Category:Grand Tour (cycling)]]\n[[Category:Annual sporting events in Spain]]\n[[Category:September sporting events]]\n[[Category:Challenge Desgrange-Colombo races]]\n[[Category:Super Prestige Pernod races]]\n", "name_user": "Alinome.net", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1935\u20131960:Typo.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuelta_a_Espa%C3%B1a"}

The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.

These include:\n\n* ''Rizblenky'' \u2013from ''rizbyty'' (\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to cut, to carve\"\u2013 are created by drilling the surface of an egg to create cut out areas.\n* ''Linyvky'' \u2013from ''linyvyi'' (\u043b\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439), \"lazy\"\u2013 a joking term to describe eggs decorated using stickers or shrink-wrap sleeves.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:pysanka.jpg|thumb|right|The world's largest pysanka was erected in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]] in 1974, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  ]]\n\nAccording to many scholars, the art of wax-resist (batik) egg decoration in Slavic cultures probably dates back to the pre-Christian era.

The sun was important \u2013 it warmed the earth and thus was a source of all life. Eggs decorated with nature symbols became an integral part of spring rituals, serving as benevolent talismans.\n\nIn pre-Christian times, Dazhboh was one of the major deities in the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]; birds were the sun god's chosen creations, for they were the only ones who could get near him. Humans could not catch the birds, but they did manage to obtain the eggs the birds laid. Thus, the eggs were magical objects, a source of life.  The egg was also honored during rite-of-Spring festivals&ndash;&ndash;it represented the rebirth of the earth. The long, hard winter was over; the earth burst forth and was reborn just as the egg miraculously burst forth with life. The egg therefore, was believed to have special powers.<ref>Manko, Vira.

Cultic ceramic eggs have been discovered in excavations near the village of Luka Vrublivets'ka, during excavations of a [[Trypillian]] site (5th to 3rd millennium BC). These eggs were ornamented, and in the form of \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0456 (torokhkal'tsi; rattles containing a small stone with which to scare evil spirits away).<ref>\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041c.\u0410. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0441   \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f-\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u00bb,  2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, no actual pysanky from the [[Kievan Rus']] period exist, but stone, clay and bone versions do, and have been excavated in many sites throughout Ukraine. Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya . [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 From Ritual Object To Art Form: The Ukrainian Easter Egg Pysanka In Its Canadian Context]. Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "text_old": "A '''pysanka''' ({{lang-uk|\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430}}, plural: ''pysanky'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Easter egg]], decorated with traditional [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] folk designs using a [[batik|wax-resist]] method.  The word ''pysanka'' comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\" or \"to [[inscribe]]\", as the designs are not painted on, but written (inscribed) with [[beeswax]].\n\nMany other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups decorate eggs using wax resist for [[Easter]]. These include the [[Belarusians]] (\u043f\u0456\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430, ''pisanka''), [[Bulgarians]] (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e \u044f\u0439\u0446\u0435, ''pisano yaytse''), [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyns]] ( \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u044b, ''pysank\u0177''), [[Croats]] (''[[Croatian pisanica|pisanica]]''), [[Czechs]] (''kraslice''), [[Hungarians]] (''h\u00edmestoj\u00e1s''), [[Lithuanians]] (''margutis''), [[Poles]] (''[[Polish pisanka|pisanka]]''), [[Romanians]] (''ou\u0103 vopsite'', ''\u00eencondeiate'' or ''\u00eempistrite''), [[Serbs]] (''pisanica''), [[Slovaks]] (''kraslica''), [[Slovenes]] (''pirhi'', ''pisanice,'' or ''remenke'') and [[Sorbs]] (''jejka pisa\u0107'').\n\n[[File:Pysanky2011.JPG|thumb|400px|A mix of modern, diasporan and traditional Ukrainian pysanky]]\n\n== Types of decorated Ukrainian eggs ==\n''Pysanka'' is often taken to mean any type of decorated egg, but it specifically refers to an egg created by the written-wax batik method and utilizing traditional folk motifs and designs.  Several other types of decorated eggs are seen in Ukrainian tradition, and these vary throughout the [[Ukrainian historical regions|regions of Ukraine]].\n* ''Krashanky'' \u2013from ''krasyty'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to decorate\"\u2013 are boiled eggs [[dyed]] a single color (with vegetable dyes, traditionally onion skin), and are blessed and eaten at Easter.\n* ''Pysanky'' \u2013from ''pysaty'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to write\"\u2013 are raw eggs created with the wax-resist method ([[Resist dyeing]]). The designs are \"written\" in hot wax with a pinhead or a special [[stylus]] called a ''pysachok'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) or a ''kistka'' (\u043a\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) which has a small funnel attached to hold a small amount of liquid wax. The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.

The sun was important \u2013 it warmed the earth and thus was a source of all life. Eggs decorated with nature symbols became an integral part of spring rituals, serving as benevolent talismans.\n\nIn pre-Christian times, Dazhboh was one of the major deities in the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]; birds were the sun god's chosen creations, for they were the only ones who could get near him. Humans could not catch the birds, but they did manage to obtain the eggs the birds laid. Thus, the eggs were magical objects, a source of life.  The egg was also honored during rite-of-Spring festivals&ndash;&ndash;it represented the rebirth of the earth. The long, hard winter was over; the earth burst forth and was reborn just as the egg miraculously burst forth with life. The egg therefore, was believed to have special powers.<ref>Manko, Vira.

Cultic ceramic eggs have been discovered in excavations near the village of Luka Vrublivets'ka, during excavations of a [[Trypillian]] site (5th to 3rd millennium BC). These eggs were ornamented, and in the form of \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0456 (torokhkal'tsi; rattles containing a small stone with which to scare evil spirits away).<ref>\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041c.\u0410. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0441   \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f-\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u00bb,  2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, no actual pysanky from the [[Kievan Rus']] period exist, but stone, clay and bone versions do, and have been excavated in many sites throughout Ukraine. Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya .

Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "name_user": "Lubap", "label": "safe", "comment": "extra space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pysanka"}

The binary decision variable ''x<sub>j</sub>'' is used to select the item. The objective is to pick some of the items, with maximal total profit, while obeying that the maximum total weight of the chosen items must not exceed ''W''.

The '''bounded knapsack problem''' specifies, for each item ''j'', an upper bound ''u<sub>j</sub>'' (which may be a positive integer, or infinity) on the number of times item ''j'' can be selected:\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j</math>\n|\n|-\n| subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math> u_j \\geq x_j \\geq 0, x_j</math> integral for all ''j''\n|}\n\nThe '''unbounded knapsack problem''' (sometimes called the '''integer knapsack problem''') does not put any upper bounds on the number of times an item may be selected:\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j</math>\n|\n|-\n| subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_j \\geq 0, x_j</math> integral for all ''j''\n|}\n\nThe unbounded variant was shown to be [[NP-complete]] in 1975 by Lueker.<ref>{{Cite paper\n  | first = G.S.\n  | last = Lueker\n  | title = Two NP-complete problems in nonnegative integer programming\n  | series = Report No. 178, Computer Science Laboratory, Princeton\n  | year = 1975}}</ref> Both the bounded and unbounded variants admit an [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme|FPTAS]] (essentially the same as the one used in the 0-1 knapsack problem).\n\nIf the items are subdivided into ''k'' classes denoted <math>N_i</math>, and exactly one item must be taken from each class, we get the '''multiple-choice knapsack problem''':\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j\\in N_i} p_{ij} x_{ij}</math>\n|\n|-\n|subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j\\in N_i} w_{ij} x_{ij} \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math>\\sum_{j \\in N_i}x_{ij} = 1,</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq i \\leq k</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq i \\leq k</math> and all <math>j \\in N_i</math>\n|}\n\nIf for each item the profit and weight are equal, we get the '''[[subset sum problem]]''' (often the corresponding [[decision problem]] is given instead):\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j</math>\n|\n|-\n|subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>\n|\n|}\n\nIf we have ''n'' items and ''m'' knapsacks with capacities <math>W_i</math>, we get the '''multiple knapsack problem''':\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_{ij}</math>\n|\n|-\n|subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_{ij} \\leq W_i,</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq i \\leq m</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>\\sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij} \\leq 1,</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq j \\leq n</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq j \\leq n</math> and all <math>1 \\leq i \\leq m</math>\n|}\n\nAs a special case of the multiple knapsack problem, when the profits are equal to weights and all bins have the same capacity, we can have '''multiple subset sum problem'''.\n\n'''[[Quadratic knapsack problem]]''':\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j+\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^n p_{ij} x_i x_j</math>\n|\n|-\n|subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>\n|for all <math>1 \\leq j \\leq n</math>\n|\n|}\n\n'''Set-Union Knapsack Problem''':\n\nSUKP is defined by Kellerer et al<ref name = KP-KPP>{{cite book\n | author= Kellerer, Hans and Pferschy, Ulrich and Pisinger, David\n | year = 2004\n | title = Knapsack Problems\n | publisher = [[Springer Verlag]]\n | isbn = 978-3-540-40286-2\n }}</ref> (on page 423) as follows:\n<blockquote>\nGiven a set of <math>n</math> items <math>N = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}</math> and a set of <math>m</math> so-called elements <math>P = \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}</math>, each item <math>j</math> corresponds to a subset <math>P_j</math> of the element set <math>P</math>.

For this reason, many special cases and generalizations have been examined.\n\nCommon to all versions are a set of ''n'' items, with each item <math>1 \\leq j \\leq n</math> having an associated profit ''p<sub>j</sub>'' ,weight ''w<sub>j</sub>''. The binary decision variable ''x<sub>j</sub>'' is used to select the item. The objective is to pick some of the items, with maximal total profit, while obeying that the maximum total weight of the chosen items must not exceed ''W''. Generally, these coefficients are scaled to become integers, and they are almost always assumed to be positive.\n\nThe '''knapsack problem''' in its most basic form:\n{|\n|colspan=\"2\"|maximize <math>\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j</math>\n|\n|-\n|subject to\n|<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j \\leq W,</math>\n|\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>\n|<math>\\forall j \\in \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}</math>\n|}\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Direct generalizations==\nOne common variant is that each item can be chosen multiple times.
