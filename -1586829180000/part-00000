It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including ''Final Fantasy VI'' had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including ''Final Fantasy VI'' had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems.

The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office.

A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nBolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. \n\nIt is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.\n\nBolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.\n\nWarren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan\u2014The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.\n\nHe signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66\u201367  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".\n\nHis tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n==Tyrannosaurus Rex==\nWhen John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />\n\nThe original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 \u201cStand and Deliver: The Autobiography\u201d]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan married his girlfriend, June Ellen Child, on 30 January 1970.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Daddy of Britpop by Marc Bolan's son |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-daddy-of-britpop-by-marc-bolans-son-6665946.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=London Evening Standard}}</ref> She was a former secretary to the manager of another of his heroes, [[Syd Barrett]], and June was influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Becoming more adventurous musically, Marc bought a modified vintage [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar (featured on the cover of the album ''[[T.

Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this\u2014some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers\u2014and their fans\u2014soon took up variations on the idea. The era of [[glam rock|glam]] and glitter rock was born.<ref name=\"Bolan glam\"/>\n[[File:Mark Bolan T-Rex (8716257007).jpg|thumb|upright|An outfit of Marc Bolan on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Sydney, Australia]]\nThe glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend [[David Bowie]], whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which would continue throughout his career.\n\nBolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and ''T. Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nBy late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.\n\nEventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n== Resurgence ==\n[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]\nIn September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nLater in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nBolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>\nThe another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.

Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation.

However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.\n\nBolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;\u2013 $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.\n\nThere are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.\n\nIn 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]]. Time-travelling [[Sam Tyler]] recognises him, has a fan boy moment, and warns him to be careful of riding in Minis. In the [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|American version of the series]], the character is replaced by that of [[Jim Croce]], who died later that year in a plane crash, and Sam warns him. However, the T. Rex version of \"Get It On\" is played in the New York dance club in that scene.\n\nIn 2007, the [[English Tourist Board]] included [[Bolan's Rock Shrine]] in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/740087/Rockin-all-over-England.html|title=Rockin' all over England|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/58393|title=Marc Bolan School of Music opens in Sierra Leone|date=2 August 2011|website=Nme.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> A musical, ''20th Century Boy'', based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the [[New Wolsey Theatre]] in [[Ipswich]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |title=A Show About Bolan in Ipswich |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020124308/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |archive-date=20 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\nSee [[T.

He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nBolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. \n\nIt is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.\n\nBolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.\n\nWarren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan\u2014The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.\n\nHe signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66\u201367  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".\n\nHis tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n==Tyrannosaurus Rex==\nWhen John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />\n\nThe original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 \u201cStand and Deliver: The Autobiography\u201d]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this\u2014some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers\u2014and their fans\u2014soon took up variations on the idea. The era of [[glam rock|glam]] and glitter rock was born.<ref name=\"Bolan glam\"/>\n[[File:Mark Bolan T-Rex (8716257007).jpg|thumb|upright|An outfit of Marc Bolan on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Sydney, Australia]]\nThe glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend [[David Bowie]], whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which would continue throughout his career.\n\nBolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and ''T. Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nBy late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.\n\nEventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n== Resurgence ==\n[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]\nIn September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nLater in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nBolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>\nThe another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.

Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation. [[Mitsubishi]] also featured \"20th Century Boy\" in a 2002 car commercial, prompting Hip-O Records to release a best-of collection CD titled ''20th Century Boy: The Ultimate Collection''.\n\nHis music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', ''Breaking-Up'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' , ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' and ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wonderland (2003)|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0335563/|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.\n\nBolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;\u2013 $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.\n\nThere are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.\n\nIn 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]].
