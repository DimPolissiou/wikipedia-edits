The party currently holds 69 seats out of 709 in the [[Bundestag]], the federal legislature of Germany, having won 9.2% of votes cast in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. Its parliamentary group is the fifth largest of six in the Bundestag, and is headed by parliamentary co-leaders [[Amira Mohamed Ali]] and [[Dietmar Bartsch]].\n\nThe party is represented in ten of Germany's sixteen state legislatures, including all five of the [[New states of Germany|eastern states]]. The party currently participates in governments in the states of both [[Berlin]] and [[Bremen]], where it is a junior partner in a three-party coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]], as well as in [[Thuringia]], where it leads a coalition with the SPD and Greens, headed by Minister-President [[Bodo Ramelow]].\n\nThe Left is a founding member of the [[Party of the European Left]], and is the third largest party in the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) group in the [[European Parliament]]. In September 2019, The Left had 61,055 registered members, making it the sixth largest party in Germany by membership.<ref name=\"membership\"/>\n\nThe party is the most [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party of the six represented in the [[Bundestag]].

From December 1989 to February 1990, the party used both names linked with a dash. After 1990 the party was led by [[Gregor Gysi]] (an attorney who had defended dissidents) and later [[Lothar Bisky]] (a professor of the film academy), who had been members of the SED, but had not belonged to the inner circle of the ruling party elite. SED members automatically became PDS members, but more than 90 percent of the once 2.3 million members left the party during the revolution or shortly thereafter.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |page=x}}</ref> The PDS also inherited parts of the SED's considerable assets, but most of them were treated as state property and put under the ''[[Treuhandanstalt]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |pages=20, 69\u201371}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[German reunification]], the PDS also created branches in former West Germany, but never managed to cross the 5-percent threshold in one of the \"old states\". It was viewed as a representation of East Germans, especially those who were disadvantaged by the economic transformation after the reunification, and as a \"protest party\" (but unlike typical protest parties, it had a very loyal voters base).<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Dan Hough |author2=Michael Ko\u00df |author3=Jonathan Olsen |title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=5}}</ref> In the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], the PDS provided [[confidence and supply]] to a minority government by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 1994 to 2002. In [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (1998\u20132006) and the state of Berlin (2002\u20132011), the PDS joined formal government coalitions with the SPD ([[red\u2013red coalition]]s). Each of these agreements sparked heated debates due to the PDS's past as the SED successor party and suspicions of left-wing extremism.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |pages=78\u201380, 120\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1998, the PDS was joined by some former members of the SPD and the Greens who were opposed to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]] and therefore disaffected with the foreign policy of their respective parties during the [[red\u2013green coalition]]. However, in the [[2002 German federal election]], the PDS won only 4 percent of votes (failing to pass the 5 percent threshold) and had only two representatives in the Bundestag who had individually won their respective constituencies.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Dan Hough |author2=Michael Ko\u00df |author3=Jonathan Olsen |title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=27}}</ref>\n\n===PDS\u2013WASG alliance===\n[[File:Oskar Lafontaine and Gregor Gysi election poster.jpg|thumb|A poster for The Left.PDS featuring [[Gregor Gysi]] and [[Oskar Lafontaine]], posted in [[Berlin]] during the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]].]]\nIn January 2005, a group of disaffected SPD members and trade unionists founded [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative]] (WASG), a left-wing party opposed to federal Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''[[Agenda 2010]]'' labour and welfare reforms. The party made a modest showing of 2.2% in the [[2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] in May, but failed to win seats. The election saw the incumbent SPD government defeated in a landslide, which was widely interpreted as a sign of the federal SPD's unpopularity. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der subsequently called an early federal election to be held September.\n\nWASG continued to gain members, prompting the PDS leadership to propose an alliance between the two parties. With the established eastern base of the PDS and WASG's potential for growth in the west, the parties hoped to enter the Bundestag together. They agreed to form an electoral pact, in which they would not run against one another in the direct mandates, and would create a joint list of candidates from both parties. They also agreed to unify into a single party in 2007. To symbolise the new relationship, the PDS renamed itself the Left Party.PDS (''Linkspartei.PDS''). The joint list ran under the name The Left.PDS (''Die Linke.PDS''), though in the western states, where the PDS was viewed with suspicion for its association with the GDR, \"PDS\" was optional. The alliance's profile was boosted when former federal Minister of Finance [[Oskar Lafontaine]], who had left the SPD after the North Rhine-Westphalia election, joined WASG in June. He was chosen as the party's top candidate for the federal election and shared the spotlight with Gregor Gysi of the PDS.\n\nPolls early in the summer showed the unified Left list winning as much as 12 percent of the vote, and for a time it seemed possible the party would surge past the Greens and FDP and become the third-largest party in the Bundestag. Alarmed by the Left's unexpected rise in the polls, Germany's mainstream politicians attacked Lafontaine and Gysi as \"leftist populists\" and \"demagogues\" and accused the party of flirting with neo-Nazi voters. A [[gaffe]] from Lafontaine early in the campaign in which he described \"foreign workers\", a term associated with the Nazi regime, as a threat, provided ammunition for charges that the Left was attempting to exploit xenophobia and racist [[populism]] to attract voters from the [[far-right politics|far-right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/241.html|title=Writers warn about Linkspartei|publisher=signandsight |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], the Left.PDS easily passed the electoral threshold, winning 8.7% of the vote and 53 seats. It became the fourth largest party in the Bundestag. The result of the election was inconclusive; between the SPD, Greens, and Left.PDS, left-wing held a majority, but the SPD was unwilling to cooperate with the Left.PDS. The result was a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] of the CDU and SPD.\n\n===Foundation of The Left===\nNegotiations for a formal merger of the PDS and WASG continued through the next year until a final agreement was reached on 27 March 2007. The new party, called The Left (''Die Linke''), held its founding congress in Berlin on 16 June 2007. Lothar Bisky and Oskar Lafontaine were elected as co-leaders, while Gregor Gysi became leader of the party's Bundestag group.\n\nThe unified party quickly became a serious force in western Germany for the first time. The party comfortably surpassed the electoral threshold in [[2007 Bremen state election|Bremen in 2007]], and throughout 2008 won seats in [[2008 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony]], [[2008 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and [[2008 Hamburg state election|Hamburg]]. The \"five-party system\" in Germany was now a reality in the west as well as the east.\n\nA string of electoral successes followed during the \"super election year\" of 2009.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|European elections]], The Left won 7.5% of the vote nationwide, continuing a steady upward trend in European elections (1994: 4.7%, 1999: 5.8%, 2004: 6.1%). Six state elections were held in 2009, and in each of them the party either surged ahead or consolidated earlier gains. They saw gains in [[2009 Thuringia state election|Thuringia]] and [[2009 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and won seats for the first time in [[2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[2009 Saarland state election|Saarland]]. Oskar Lafontaine ran as the party's lead candidate in Saarland, leading the party to a massive success with 21.3% of the vote. In [[2009 Saxony state election|Saxony]] and [[2009 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]], The Left's vote declined slightly, but it remained the second largest party in both states.\n\n===2009 federal election===\n[[File:Bundestag 2009 Linke.svg|thumb|Results for the second votes by constituency in the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]].]]\nThe electoral collapse of the Social Democratic Party in the [[2009 German federal election|federal election]] on 27 September 2009 gave The Left an unprecedented opportunity. The party's vote surged to 11.9%, increasing its representation in the Bundestag from 54 to 76 seats, just under half as large as the SPD's parliamentary group.\n\nThe Left won seats in the parliament of Germany's most populous state, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], in May 2010. They now held seats in thirteen of Germany's sixteen states, only absent from three states in the traditionally conservative south.\n\nIn January 2010, Oskar Lafontaine announced that, due to his ongoing cancer treatment, he would not seek re-election to the party leadership at the upcoming party congress. At the congress in May, Lothar Bisky also chose not to nominate for re-election; [[Klaus Ernst]] and [[Gesine L\u00f6tzsch]] were elected as the party's new leaders.\n\nJust a few weeks later, the SPD and Greens invited the Left to support their candidate for the [[2010 German presidential election|2010 presidential election]], former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] [[Joachim Gauck]]. They suggested that this was an opportunity for the Left to leave their communist past behind them and show unconditional support for democracy.<ref>{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-06/gauck-linkspartei|title=Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl: Linke, w\u00e4hlt Gauck!|publisher=Zeit.de |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref> However, the party refused to support him, highlighting his support of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and his attacks on The Left party.<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Linke-ist-gegen-Gauck-article942387.html \"Nicht w\u00e4hlbar\": Linke ist gegen Gauck], n-tv, 28 June 2010</ref> They also rejected the conservative [[Christian Wulff]], favourite of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703784,00.html Linke verhindert Gauck, Wulff wird Pr\u00e4sident], Manager Magazin</ref> They instead put forward their own nominee, television journalist [[Luc Jochimsen]].<ref>{{cite web|author=von Markus Ehrenberg|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/tagesschau-luc-jochimsen-oder-doch-lukrezia/1854908.html |title=Tagesschau: Luc Jochimsen?

In the [[2019 Bremen state election|Bremen state election]] held on the same day, the party made small gains, and entered into government under the SPD and Greens. The Left suffered major losses in the [[2019 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]] and [[2019 Saxony state election|Saxony]] state elections held on 1 September, losing almost half its voteshare in each. As a result, The Left left the Brandenburg government, in which they had participated since 2009.\n\nIn October however, Bodo Ramelow led the party to its best ever result in the [[2019 Thuringian state election|Thuringian state election]], winning 31.0% and becoming the largest party in a state legislature for the first time, though his red-red-green government lost its majority. In February 2020, the FDP's [[Thomas Kemmerich]] was elected Minister-President with the support of AfD and the CDU, but immediately resigned due to widespread outrage. After a protracted [[2019 Thuringian state election#Government formation|government crisis]], Ramelow was re-elected for a second term to lead a minority government.\n\nIn the [[2020 Hamburg state election]], the Left made small gains.\n\n==Ideology==\nThe Left aims for [[democratic socialism]] in order to overcome [[capitalism]]. As a platform for left politics in the wake of [[globalization]], The Left includes many different factions, ranging from [[communism|communists]] to [[social democracy|social democrats]]. In March 2007, during the joint party convention of Left Party and WASG, a document outlining political principles was agreed on. The official program of the party was decided upon by an overwhelming majority at the party conference in October 2011 in Erfurt, Thuringia.\n\nThe party's fiscal policies are based on [[Keynesian economics]], originating from the 1930s when governments responded to the [[Great Depression]]. The central bank and government should collaborate with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in order to ameliorate [[business cycle]]s, to support economic growth, and to reduce unemployment. Wage rises in the private sector should be determined through the productivity growth, the target inflation rate of the [[European Central Bank]], and [[Master contract (labor)|master contract]]s.\n\nThe party aims at increasing [[government spending]] in the areas of public investments, education, research and development, culture, and infrastructure, as well as increasing taxes for large [[corporations]]. It calls for increases in [[inheritance tax]] rates and the reinstatement of the individual \"net worth\" tax. The Left aims at a linear [[income tax]] progression, which would reduce the tax burden for lower incomes, while raising the middle- and top-income tax rates. The combating of tax loopholes is a perennial issue, as The Left believes that they primarily benefit people with high incomes.\n\nThe financial markets should be subject to heavier government regulation, with the goal, among others, to reduce the speculation of bonds and derivatives. The party wants to strengthen [[Competition law|anti-trust laws]] and empower [[cooperatives]] to decentralise the economy. Further economic reforms shall include solidarity and more self-determination for workers, a ban on [[hydraulic fracturing|gas and oil fracking]], the rejection of privatization and the introduction of a federal [[minimum wage]],<ref name=BBCLeft>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8272658.stm|title=German hard left set to gain ground |author=Steve Rosenberg  |publisher=BBC News|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref> and more generally the overthrow of property and power structures in which, citing [[Karl Marx]]'s aphorism, \"man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence\".<ref>\"''Our alternative: Social, democratic and peacemaking reforms to overcome capitalism''\" [http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf Programmatic Points, part III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210617/http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nConcerning foreign policy, The Left calls for international [[disarmament]], while ruling out any form of involvement of the [[Bundeswehr]] outside of Germany. The party calls for a replacement of [[NATO]] with a collective security system including [[Russia]] as a member country. German foreign policy should be strictly confined to the goals of civil diplomacy and cooperation, instead of confrontation.\n\nThe Left supports further debt cancellations for developing countries and increases in development aid, in collaboration with the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], and diverse bilateral treaties among countries. The party supports [[reform of the United Nations]] as long as it is aimed at a fair balance between developed and developing countries. The Left would have all American military bases within Germany, and if possible in the [[European Union]], enacted within a binding treaty, dissolved. The Left welcomes the European process of integration, while opposing what it believes to be [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies in the European Union. The party strives for the democratisation of the EU institutions and a stronger role of the United Nations in international politics. The Left opposed both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]],<ref name=BBCLeft/> as well as the [[Lisbon Treaty]].<ref name=\"euractiv lisbon treaty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|title=Bundestag paves way for Lisbon Treaty ratification|publisher=EurActive.com|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2009-09-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609230050/http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|archivedate=2011-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe party has a mixed stance towards the [[Ukrainian crisis]].

As of 2018, the group has 836 members.<ref name=\"BfV2018\"/> Due to its association with Marx21, SL is monitored by the ''Verfassungsschutz''.<ref name=\"BfW2018\">{{citation|publisher=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]]|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2018|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/vsbericht-2018.pdf}}</ref> Leading members include [[Janine Wissler]], [[Thomas H\u00e4ndel]], [[J\u00fcrgen Klute]], and [[Christine Buchholz]].\n\nIn addition to the recognised platforms, a number of smaller groups have aligned with The Left and its predecessors, such as Marx21. The Trotskyist [[Socialist Alternative (Germany)|Socialist Alternative]] (SAV) is another example, though the membership applications of some of its leaders, including [[Lucy Redler]], were initially rejected. ''Der Funke'', supporters of the [[International Marxist Tendency]] (IMT) in Germany, pursue [[Entryism|entryist]] strategies in the party, while the [[Fourth International (post-reunification)|Fourth International]]-affiliated [[International Socialist Organisation (Germany)|International Socialist Organisation]] (ISO) also works inside The Left. Other left-wing groups, such as the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), have formed local alliances with the party, but have not joined. The [[Association for Solidarity Perspectives]] (VsP) also supports the party.\n\nThe party has a youth wing ([[Left Youth Solid]]) and a student wing known as The Left.SDS. The party is also affiliated with a number of left-wing [[think tank]]s, education, and policy groups, most prominently the [[Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]].\n\n==Membership and electorate==\n[[File:Membership of The Left by year, 2007-2019.png|thumb|350px|Membership of The Left over time.]]\nThe PDS inherited 170,000 members from the SED in 1990, but suffered constant decline from that point until the merger with WASG. Upon its formation, The Left had 71,000 members, of which 11,500 had been WASG members. Over the next two years the party grew, reaching a peak of 78,000 in 2009, after which point numbers began to decline. In 2016, the party had 59,000 members. However, the trend reversed in 2017, and the party gained several thousand new members for a total of 62,300.<ref name=\"BPBorganisation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/die-linke/42135/organisation|title=Die Organisation der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nA large part of The Left's base and membership reside in the [[New states of Germany|new states]] (the former GDR). The voting base of the PDS was limited almost entirely to the east; upon its formation, the vast majority of The Left's western membership came from WASG. However, this has been changing in recent years: while in [[2005 German federal election|2005]], the Left.PDS list won just 45.5% of its votes in the western states, this grew to 57.7% in [[2009 German federal election|2009]], and 65.4% in [[2017 German federal election|2017]]. Despite this, on the state level, the party has been marginalised in the west since making several breakthroughs in 2007\u20132010. Since 2010, it has lost representation in the Landtags of [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Generally growing popularity in the west has also been offset by major losses in most of its eastern heartland since 2014.<ref name=\"BPBelectorate\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/themen/FB25SL,0,DIE_LINKE_%96_W%E4hlerschaft_und_Mitglieder.html|title=Wahlergebnisse und W\u00e4hlerschaft der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the merger, the voting base of PDS was an approximate cross-section of the population, favoured somewhat by more educated voters. Since the merger, The Left has become more favoured among working-class and poorer voters, which made up the core of WASG's support.<ref name=\"BPBelectorate\"/> According to regular studies by the [[Free University of Berlin]], in 2017 The Left's membership compromised around 19% blue-collar workers, 32% white-collar workers, 34% civil servants, and 16% self-employed. 46% of party members held an academic degree, and 68% were not organized in unions.<ref name=\"BPBsurvey\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/zahlen-und-fakten/140358/soziale-zusammensetzung|title=Die soziale Zusammensetzung der Parteimitgliederschaften|date=7 October 2017|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nThe Left's voter demographics are skewed strongly by region.

Prior to the merger, PDS had by far the highest proportion of members over 60 years of any party, at 68%, and the lowest proportion of members under 30, at just 4%. By 2016, these numbers had fallen and risen, respectively, to 47% and 14%.

During this period, the party's membership total in the west exceeded that of the east for the first time.<ref name=\"ND2018\"/>\n\nWomen have been well-represented amongst elected representatives from The Left. The party's [[Women in government#Quotas|gender quota]] requires that at least half of the party's ruling bodies and representatives should be female. Amongst the party membership however, the proportion of women has decreased in recent years since the large majority of WASG members were male.<ref name=\"BPBorganisation\"/> The proportion of female members fell from 44% in the PDS in 2006 to 39% post-merger in 2007; nonetheless, the party had the highest representation of women in its membership until it was overtaken by the Greens in 2012.<ref name=\"BPBsurvey\"/> After the 2009 election, the party's Bundestag group was 52.6% female, second only to the Greens (57.4%).

Members of The Left and groups within the party have been periodically monitored, sometimes leading to controversy.

The party currently holds 69 seats out of 709 in the [[Bundestag]], the federal legislature of Germany, having won 9.2% of votes cast in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. Its parliamentary group is the fifth largest of six in the Bundestag, and is headed by parliamentary co-leaders [[Amira Mohamed Ali]] and [[Dietmar Bartsch]].\n\nThe party is represented in ten of Germany's sixteen state legislatures, including all five of the [[New states of Germany|eastern states]]. The party currently participates in governments in the states of both [[Berlin]] and [[Bremen]], where it is a junior partner in a three-party coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]], as well as in [[Thuringia]], where it leads a coalition with the SPD and Greens, headed by Minister-President [[Bodo Ramelow]].\n\nThe Left is a founding member of the [[Party of the European Left]], and is the third largest party in the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) group in the [[European Parliament]]. In September 2019, The Left had 61,055 registered members, making it the sixth largest party in Germany by membership.<ref name=\"membership\"/>\n\nThe party is the most [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party of the six represented in the [[Bundestag]].

From December 1989 to February 1990, the party used both names linked with a dash. After 1990 the party was led by [[Gregor Gysi]] (an attorney who had defended dissidents) and later [[Lothar Bisky]] (a professor of the film academy), who had been members of the SED, but had not belonged to the inner circle of the ruling party elite. SED members automatically became PDS members, but more than 90 percent of the once 2.3 million members left the party during the revolution or shortly thereafter.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |page=x}}</ref> The PDS also inherited parts of the SED's considerable assets, but most of them were treated as state property and put under the ''[[Treuhandanstalt]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |pages=20, 69\u201371}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[German reunification]], the PDS also created branches in former West Germany, but never managed to cross the 5-percent threshold in one of the \"old states\". It was viewed as a representation of East Germans, especially those who were disadvantaged by the economic transformation after the reunification, and as a \"protest party\" (but unlike typical protest parties, it had a very loyal voters base).<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Dan Hough |author2=Michael Ko\u00df |author3=Jonathan Olsen |title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=5}}</ref> In the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], the PDS provided [[confidence and supply]] to a minority government by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 1994 to 2002. In [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (1998\u20132006) and the state of Berlin (2002\u20132011), the PDS joined formal government coalitions with the SPD ([[red\u2013red coalition]]s). Each of these agreements sparked heated debates due to the PDS's past as the SED successor party and suspicions of left-wing extremism.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Franz Oswald |title=The Party that Came Out of the Cold War: The Party of Democratic Socialism in United Germany |publisher=Praeger |year=2002 |pages=78\u201380, 120\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1998, the PDS was joined by some former members of the SPD and the Greens who were opposed to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]] and therefore disaffected with the foreign policy of their respective parties during the [[red\u2013green coalition]]. However, in the [[2002 German federal election]], the PDS won only 4 percent of votes (failing to pass the 5 percent threshold) and had only two representatives in the Bundestag who had individually won their respective constituencies.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Dan Hough |author2=Michael Ko\u00df |author3=Jonathan Olsen |title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=27}}</ref>\n\n===PDS\u2013WASG alliance===\n[[File:Oskar Lafontaine and Gregor Gysi election poster.jpg|thumb|A poster for The Left.PDS featuring [[Gregor Gysi]] and [[Oskar Lafontaine]], posted in [[Berlin]] during the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]].]]\nIn January 2005, a group of disaffected SPD members and trade unionists founded [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative]] (WASG), a left-wing party opposed to federal Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s [[Agenda 2010]]. The party made a modest showing of 2.2% in the [[2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] in May, but failed to win seats. The election saw the incumbent SPD government defeated in a landslide, which was widely interpreted as a sign of the federal SPD's unpopularity. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der subsequently called an early federal election to be held September.\n\nWASG continued to gain members, prompting the PDS leadership to propose an alliance between the two parties. With the established eastern base of the PDS and WASG's potential for growth in the west, the parties hoped to enter the Bundestag together. They agreed to form an electoral pact, in which they would not run against one another in the direct mandates, and would create a joint list of candidates from both parties. They also agreed to unify into a single party in 2007. To symbolise the new relationship, the PDS renamed itself the Left Party.PDS (''Linkspartei.PDS''). The joint list ran under the name The Left.PDS (''Die Linke.PDS''), though in the western states, where the PDS was viewed with suspicion for its association with the GDR, \"PDS\" was optional. The alliance's profile was boosted when former federal Minister of Finance [[Oskar Lafontaine]], who had left the SPD after the North Rhine-Westphalia election, joined WASG in June. He was chosen as the party's top candidate for the federal election and shared the spotlight with Gregor Gysi of the PDS.\n\nPolls early in the summer showed the unified Left list winning as much as 12 percent of the vote, and for a time it seemed possible the party would surge past the Greens and FDP and become the third-largest party in the Bundestag. Alarmed by the Left's unexpected rise in the polls, Germany's mainstream politicians attacked Lafontaine and Gysi as \"leftist populists\" and \"demagogues\" and accused the party of flirting with neo-Nazi voters. A [[gaffe]] from Lafontaine early in the campaign in which he described \"foreign workers\", a term associated with the Nazi regime, as a threat, provided ammunition for charges that the Left was attempting to exploit xenophobia and racist [[populism]] to attract voters from the [[far-right politics|far-right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/241.html|title=Writers warn about Linkspartei|publisher=signandsight |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], the Left.PDS easily passed the electoral threshold, winning 8.7% of the vote and 53 seats. It became the fourth largest party in the Bundestag. The result of the election was inconclusive; between the SPD, Greens, and Left.PDS, left-wing held a majority, but the SPD was unwilling to cooperate with the Left.PDS. The result was a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] of the CDU and SPD.\n\n===Foundation of The Left===\nNegotiations for a formal merger of the PDS and WASG continued through the next year until a final agreement was reached on 27 March 2007. The new party, called The Left (''Die Linke''), held its founding congress in Berlin on 16 June 2007. Lothar Bisky and Oskar Lafontaine were elected as co-leaders, while Gregor Gysi became leader of the party's Bundestag group.\n\nThe unified party quickly became a serious force in western Germany for the first time. The party comfortably surpassed the electoral threshold in [[2007 Bremen state election|Bremen in 2007]], and throughout 2008 won seats in [[2008 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony]], [[2008 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and [[2008 Hamburg state election|Hamburg]]. The \"five-party system\" in Germany was now a reality in the west as well as the east.\n\nA string of electoral successes followed during the \"super election year\" of 2009.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|European elections]], The Left won 7.5% of the vote nationwide, continuing a steady upward trend in European elections (1994: 4.7%, 1999: 5.8%, 2004: 6.1%). Six state elections were held in 2009, and in each of them the party either surged ahead or consolidated earlier gains. They saw gains in [[2009 Thuringia state election|Thuringia]] and [[2009 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and won seats for the first time in [[2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[2009 Saarland state election|Saarland]]. Oskar Lafontaine ran as the party's lead candidate in Saarland, leading the party to a massive success with 21.3% of the vote. In [[2009 Saxony state election|Saxony]] and [[2009 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]], The Left's vote declined slightly, but it remained the second largest party in both states.\n\n===2009 federal election===\n[[File:Bundestag 2009 Linke.svg|thumb|Results for the second votes by constituency in the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]].]]\nThe electoral collapse of the Social Democratic Party in the [[2009 German federal election|federal election]] on 27 September 2009 gave The Left an unprecedented opportunity. The party's vote surged to 11.9%, increasing its representation in the Bundestag from 54 to 76 seats, just under half as large as the SPD's parliamentary group.\n\nThe Left won seats in the parliament of Germany's most populous state, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], in May 2010. They now held seats in thirteen of Germany's sixteen states, only absent from three states in the traditionally conservative south.\n\nIn January 2010, Oskar Lafontaine announced that, due to his ongoing cancer treatment, he would not seek re-election to the party leadership at the upcoming party congress. At the congress in May, Lothar Bisky also chose not to nominate for re-election; [[Klaus Ernst]] and [[Gesine L\u00f6tzsch]] were elected as the party's new leaders.\n\nJust a few weeks later, the SPD and Greens invited the Left to support their candidate for the [[2010 German presidential election|2010 presidential election]], former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] [[Joachim Gauck]]. They suggested that this was an opportunity for the Left to leave their communist past behind them and show unconditional support for democracy.<ref>{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-06/gauck-linkspartei|title=Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl: Linke, w\u00e4hlt Gauck!|publisher=Zeit.de |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref> However, the party refused to support him, highlighting his support of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and his attacks on The Left party.<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Linke-ist-gegen-Gauck-article942387.html \"Nicht w\u00e4hlbar\": Linke ist gegen Gauck], n-tv, 28 June 2010</ref> They also rejected the conservative [[Christian Wulff]], favourite of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703784,00.html Linke verhindert Gauck, Wulff wird Pr\u00e4sident], Manager Magazin</ref> They instead put forward their own nominee, television journalist [[Luc Jochimsen]].<ref>{{cite web|author=von Markus Ehrenberg|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/tagesschau-luc-jochimsen-oder-doch-lukrezia/1854908.html |title=Tagesschau: Luc Jochimsen?

In the [[2019 Bremen state election|Bremen state election]] held on the same day, the party made small gains, and entered into government under the SPD and Greens. The Left suffered major losses in the [[2019 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]] and [[2019 Saxony state election|Saxony]] state elections held on 1 September, losing almost half its voteshare in each. As a result, The Left left the Brandenburg government, in which they had participated since 2009.\n\nIn October however, Bodo Ramelow led the party to its best ever result in the [[2019 Thuringian state election|Thuringian state election]], winning 31.0% and becoming the largest party in a state legislature for the first time, though his red-red-green government lost its majority. In February 2020, the FDP's [[Thomas Kemmerich]] was elected Minister-President with the support of AfD and the CDU, but immediately resigned due to widespread outrage. After a protracted [[2019 Thuringian state election#Government formation|government crisis]], Ramelow was re-elected for a second term to lead a minority government.\n\nIn the [[2020 Hamburg state election]], the Left made small gains.\n\n==Ideology==\nThe Left aims for [[democratic socialism]] in order to overcome [[capitalism]]. As a platform for left politics in the wake of [[globalization]], The Left includes many different factions, ranging from [[communism|communists]] to [[social democracy|social democrats]]. In March 2007, during the joint party convention of Left Party and WASG, a document outlining political principles was agreed on. The official program of the party was decided upon by an overwhelming majority at the party conference in October 2011 in Erfurt, Thuringia.\n\nThe party's fiscal policies are based on [[Keynesian economics]], originating from the 1930s when governments responded to the [[Great Depression]]. The central bank and government should collaborate with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in order to ameliorate [[business cycle]]s, to support economic growth, and to reduce unemployment. Wage rises in the private sector should be determined through the productivity growth, the target inflation rate of the [[European Central Bank]], and [[Master contract (labor)|master contract]]s.\n\nThe party aims at increasing [[government spending]] in the areas of public investments, education, research and development, culture, and infrastructure, as well as increasing taxes for large [[corporations]]. It calls for increases in [[inheritance tax]] rates and the reinstatement of the individual \"net worth\" tax. The Left aims at a linear [[income tax]] progression, which would reduce the tax burden for lower incomes, while raising the middle- and top-income tax rates. The combating of tax loopholes is a perennial issue, as The Left believes that they primarily benefit people with high incomes.\n\nThe financial markets should be subject to heavier government regulation, with the goal, among others, to reduce the speculation of bonds and derivatives. The party wants to strengthen [[Competition law|anti-trust laws]] and empower [[cooperatives]] to decentralise the economy. Further economic reforms shall include solidarity and more self-determination for workers, a ban on [[hydraulic fracturing|gas and oil fracking]], the rejection of privatization and the introduction of a federal [[minimum wage]],<ref name=BBCLeft>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8272658.stm|title=German hard left set to gain ground |author=Steve Rosenberg  |publisher=BBC News|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref> and more generally the overthrow of property and power structures in which, citing [[Karl Marx]]'s aphorism, \"man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence\".<ref>\"''Our alternative: Social, democratic and peacemaking reforms to overcome capitalism''\" [http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf Programmatic Points, part III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210617/http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nConcerning foreign policy, The Left calls for international [[disarmament]], while ruling out any form of involvement of the [[Bundeswehr]] outside of Germany. The party calls for a replacement of [[NATO]] with a collective security system including [[Russia]] as a member country. German foreign policy should be strictly confined to the goals of civil diplomacy and cooperation, instead of confrontation.\n\nThe Left supports further debt cancellations for developing countries and increases in development aid, in collaboration with the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], and diverse bilateral treaties among countries. The party supports [[reform of the United Nations]] as long as it is aimed at a fair balance between developed and developing countries. The Left would have all American military bases within Germany, and if possible in the [[European Union]], enacted within a binding treaty, dissolved. The Left welcomes the European process of integration, while opposing what it believes to be [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies in the European Union. The party strives for the democratisation of the EU institutions and a stronger role of the United Nations in international politics. The Left opposed both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]],<ref name=BBCLeft/> as well as the [[Lisbon Treaty]].<ref name=\"euractiv lisbon treaty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|title=Bundestag paves way for Lisbon Treaty ratification|publisher=EurActive.com|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2009-09-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609230050/http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|archivedate=2011-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe party has a mixed stance towards the [[Ukrainian crisis]].

It is closely associated with the Democratic Socialist Forum, which was formed around the same time. The Reform Left Network strongly supports involvement in coalition governments with the SPD and Greens. It includes a number of prominent Left politicians, including former PDS chairperson and current Bundestag Vice-President [[Petra Pau]], and The Left's Saxony-Anhalt leader Wulf Gallert. Other members include [[Jan Korte (politician)|Jan Korte]], [[Stefan Liebich]], and Halina Wawzyniak.\n*The '''[[Socialist Left (Germany)|Socialist Left]]''' (''Sozialistische Linke, SL'') includes [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] leftists and [[Eurocommunism|reform communists]], and seeks to orient the party toward the [[Trade unions in Germany|labour movement]]. The revolutionary socialist current [[Linksruck|Marx21]] organises within SL, as it does not meet the requirements to become its own caucus. Many leaders of the Socialist Left were formerly members of WASG, and the group models itself on the Dutch [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and the Italian [[Communist Refoundation Party]]. As of 2018, the group has 836 members.<ref name=\"BfV2018\"/> Due to its association with Marx21, SL is monitored by the ''Verfassungsschutz''.<ref name=\"BfW2018\">{{citation|publisher=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]]|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2018|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/vsbericht-2018.pdf}}</ref> Leading members include [[Janine Wissler]], [[Thomas H\u00e4ndel]], [[J\u00fcrgen Klute]], and [[Christine Buchholz]].\n\nIn addition to the recognised platforms, a number of smaller groups have aligned with The Left and its predecessors, such as Marx21. The Trotskyist [[Socialist Alternative (Germany)|Socialist Alternative]] (SAV) is another example, though the membership applications of some of its leaders, including [[Lucy Redler]], were initially rejected. ''Der Funke'', supporters of the [[International Marxist Tendency]] (IMT) in Germany, pursue [[Entryism|entryist]] strategies in the party, while the [[Fourth International (post-reunification)|Fourth International]]-affiliated [[International Socialist Organisation (Germany)|International Socialist Organisation]] (ISO) also works inside The Left. Other left-wing groups, such as the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), have formed local alliances with the party, but have not joined. The [[Association for Solidarity Perspectives]] (VsP) also supports the party.\n\nThe party has a youth wing ([[Left Youth Solid]]) and a student wing known as The Left.SDS. The party is also affiliated with a number of left-wing [[think tank]]s, education, and policy groups, most prominently the [[Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]].\n\n==Membership and electorate==\n[[File:Membership of The Left by year, 2007-2019.png|thumb|350px|Membership of The Left over time.]]\nThe PDS inherited 170,000 members from the SED in 1990, but suffered constant decline from that point until the merger with WASG. Upon its formation, The Left had 71,000 members, of which 11,500 had been WASG members. Over the next two years the party grew, reaching a peak of 78,000 in 2009, after which point numbers began to decline. In 2016, the party had 59,000 members. However, the trend reversed in 2017, and the party gained several thousand new members for a total of 62,300.<ref name=\"BPBorganisation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/die-linke/42135/organisation|title=Die Organisation der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nA large part of The Left's base and membership reside in the [[New states of Germany|new states]] (the former GDR). The voting base of the PDS was limited almost entirely to the east; upon its formation, the vast majority of The Left's western membership came from WASG. However, this has been changing in recent years: while in [[2005 German federal election|2005]], the Left.PDS list won just 45.5% of its votes in the western states, this grew to 57.7% in [[2009 German federal election|2009]], and 65.4% in [[2017 German federal election|2017]]. Despite this, on the state level, the party has been marginalised in the west since making several breakthroughs in 2007\u20132010. Since 2010, it has lost representation in the Landtags of [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Generally growing popularity in the west has also been offset by major losses in most of its eastern heartland since 2014.<ref name=\"BPBelectorate\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/themen/FB25SL,0,DIE_LINKE_%96_W%E4hlerschaft_und_Mitglieder.html|title=Wahlergebnisse und W\u00e4hlerschaft der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the merger, the voting base of PDS was an approximate cross-section of the population, favoured somewhat by more educated voters. Since the merger, The Left has become more favoured among working-class and poorer voters, which made up the core of WASG's support.<ref name=\"BPBelectorate\"/> According to regular studies by the [[Free University of Berlin]], in 2017 The Left's membership compromised around 19% blue-collar workers, 32% white-collar workers, 34% civil servants, and 16% self-employed. 46% of party members held an academic degree, and 68% were not organized in unions.<ref name=\"BPBsurvey\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/zahlen-und-fakten/140358/soziale-zusammensetzung|title=Die soziale Zusammensetzung der Parteimitgliederschaften|date=7 October 2017|publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Politische Bildung}}</ref>\n\nThe Left's voter demographics are skewed strongly by region.

During this period, the party's membership total in the west exceeded that of the east for the first time.<ref name=\"ND2018\"/>\n\nWomen have been well-represented amongst elected representatives from The Left. The party's [[Women in government#Quotas|gender quota]] requires that at least half of the party's ruling bodies and representatives should be female. Amongst the party membership however, the proportion of women has decreased in recent years since the large majority of WASG members were male.<ref name=\"BPBorganisation\"/> The proportion of female members fell from 44% in the PDS in 2006 to 39% post-merger in 2007; nonetheless, the party had the highest representation of women in its membership until it was overtaken by the Greens in 2012.<ref name=\"BPBsurvey\"/> After the 2009 election, the party's Bundestag group was 52.6% female, second only to the Greens (57.4%).
