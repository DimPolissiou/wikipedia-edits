General [[definitions of music]] include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]] (''mousike''; \"art of the [[Muse]]s\").<ref name=\"perseus.tufts.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\nSee [[glossary of musical terminology]].\n\nIn its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the [[harmony of the spheres]]\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no [[noise]], only sound.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as \"not being music\", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,<ref>Watson 2009, 109\u201310.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}</ref> early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s<ref>Reiland Rabaka.

''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.</ref> There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions\u2013such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nMusic can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.\n\nIn many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, [[sheet music]], and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, [[music criticism|music critics]], [[music journalism|music journalists]], and [[musicology|music scholars]] may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]\nThe word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]] (''mousike''; \"art of the [[Muses]]\").<ref name=\"perseus.tufts.edu\"/> In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term \"music\" is derived from \"mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' \"the art of music,\" also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''m\u00fasica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'').\" This is derived from the \"...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' \"(art) of the Muses,\" from fem. of mousikos \"pertaining to the Muses,\" from Mousa \"Muse\" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term \"music\" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]].\"<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==As a form of art or entertainment==\n[[File:Photo r\u00e9cital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Saint-Fran\u00e7ois Xavier]]\nMusic is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a \"self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.\"<ref>Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}</ref>\n\nAmateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.\n\nA distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Musical composition}}\n[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album \"Hubardo\" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]\n[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657\u20131726), pen in hand.]]\n\"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music \"score\"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.\n\nEven when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.\n\nThe study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].\n\n===Notation===\n{{Main|Musical notation}}\n[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled \"[[Adeste Fideles]]\", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices.[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a \"slow blues\" or a \"fast swing\", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.\n\nWritten notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).\n\nIn Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz \"[[big band]]s.\" In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as \"tab\"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.\n\n===Improvisation===\n[[File:Johnny Hodges edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Improvisation plays a central role in jazz; musicians learn progressions using scale and chord tones (Pictured is [[Johnny Hodges]])]]\n{{Main|Musical improvisation}}\n[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or [[chord progression]]. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones not from the typical scales associated with a chord. Imorovisay on a song can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. \n\nIn the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as [[Prelude (music)|prelude]]s. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts.\n\nHowever, in the 20th and early 21st century, as \"common practice\" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century [[art music]] composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.\n\n===Theory===\n{{Main|Music theory}}\nMusic theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music \u2013 rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought\u2026 |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}</ref> People who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.\n\n==Elements==\n{{main|Aspect of music}}\nMusic has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the \"elements of music\":\n* Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure.<ref>ACARA. (2015).

Core music standards glossary. http://www.nafme.org/my-classroom/standards/core-music-standards /</ref>\n\nIn relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate [[musical notation]]s\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.<ref>Gov.uk. (2013).

Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"the elements of music\" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the \"rudimentary elements of music\" and the \"perceptual elements of music\".\n\n===Rudimentary elements===\nIn the 1800s, the phrases \"the elements of music\" and \"the rudiments of music\" were used interchangeably.<ref>[[Muzio Clementi|Clementi, M.]]: \"Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte\", Da Capo Press (1974).

In Dictionary.com unabridged. Retrieved 10 June 2015</ref> The UK's curriculum switch to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.\n\n===Perceptual elements===\nSince the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',<ref>Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.</ref> identified four \"psychological attributes of sound\". These were: \"pitch, loudness, time, and timbre\" (p.&nbsp;3). He did not call them the \"elements of music\" but referred to them as \"elemental components\" (p.&nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: \"Pitch\" and \"timbre\" match exactly, \"loudness\" links with dynamics and \"time\" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase \"the elements of music\" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: \"a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods\"<ref>Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.</ref> and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.\n\nAlthough writers of lists of \"rudimentary elements of music\" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.\n\n===Analysis of styles===\n[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]\nSome styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.\n\n===Description of elements===\n\n====Pitch and melody====\n[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.\n[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song \"[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]\"  [[File:Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|thumb]]]]\n\nA [[melody]] (also called a \"tune\") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the \"[[white notes]]\" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the \"white notes\" and \"black notes\" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].\n\n====Harmony and chords====\n[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]\u2013 three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]\n[[Harmony]] refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the \"home note\" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\n\n====Rhythm====\nRhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.\n\n====Texture====\n[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:\n* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or \"tune\") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.\n* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.\n* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as \"[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]\", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.\n* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.\n\nMusic that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a \"thicker\" or \"denser\" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).\n\n====Timbre or \"tone color\"====\n{{Main|Timbre}}\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\" or \"tone color\" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.<ref>Harnsberger, Lindsey. \"Articulation.\" ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.</ref> Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).\n\nThe physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].\n\n====Expression====\n[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]\nExpressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).\n\nExpression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey \"an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life.

From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] (\"refrain\") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}</ref> Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].\n\nScholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co.

Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:\n\n;Strophic form\nThis form is defined by its \"unrelieved repetition\" ('''AAAA'''...).\n\n;Medley\n\n[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of \"unrelieved variation\": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.\n\n;Binary form\n[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.<ref>White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, \"simple binary\" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.\nb\n;Ternary form\nThis form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. \"repeat from the top\") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the \"middle eight\". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.\n\n;Rondo form\nThis form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called \"episodes\". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a \"development\" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.\n\n;Variational form\nVariational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.\n\n'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only \"section\" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] \u2013 a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA<sup>1</sup>BA<sup>2</sup>CA<sup>3</sup>BA<sup>4</sup>''') or ('''ABA<sup>1</sup>CA<sup>2</sup>B<sup>1</sup>A''').\n\n;Developmental form\nDevelopmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].\n\nThis form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|date=September 2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the \"A\" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the \"B\" part (the [[musical development|development]]) \u2013 thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A<sup>1</sup>ab<sup>1</sup>+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as [[Berlioz]], [[Liszt]] and [[Wagner]] made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of music}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|A bone flute which is over 41,000 years old.]]\n\n[[Prehistoric music]] can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites.

[[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].<!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &c.?--> Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs).

Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\n\n===Baroque===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (''[[Bach cello suites|Cello suites]]''), [[George Frideric Handel]] (''[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]''), [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]] (''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'').\n\n===Classicism===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A.

Even before he became a celebrated composer, he was widely known as a gifted performer and improviser.]]\nThe music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],<ref>Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1970. Print.</ref> where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses).\n\nImportance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.\n\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.\n\nThe best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\n\n===Romanticism===\n[[File:Moritz von Schwind Schubertiade.jpg|thumb|230px|The piano was the centrepiece of social activity for middle-class urbanites in the 19th century ([[Moritz von Schwind]], 1868).

Wagner]]<br /><small>[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:silver;\"|[[File:Wagner - die walkure fantasie.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.\n\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound \"colours\". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===20th and 21st century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n\nIn the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.\n\nThe focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]<ref>Schaeffer, P. (1966), Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.</ref> and [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.\n\n[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].<ref>Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nRock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].<ref>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 \u2013 Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things|show=55}}{{Time needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]]. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its \"purest form\", it \"has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody\".{{Cite quote|date=February 2020}} The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands also have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the [[DX-7]] synthesizer, electronic [[drum machine]]s such as the [[TR-808]] and synth bass devices (such as the [[TB-303]]) or [[synth bass]] keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g., [[digital audio workstation]]s)  were used. In the 2020s, [[soft synth]]s and computer music apps make it possible for [[bedroom producers]] to create and record some types of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] in their own home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, some bands in genres such as [[nu metal]] began including [[DJ]]s in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music on record players or CD players, using a [[DJ mixer]].\n\n==Performance==\n{{Main|Performance}}\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]\n[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]\nPerformance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.\n\nA performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles\u2013or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea\u2013a melody or other musical line\u2013created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.\n\nMany cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.\n\n===Oral and aural tradition===\nMany types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]\". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as \"traditional\" or as a \"folk song\". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.\n\n===Ornamentation===\n{{Main|Ornament (music)}}\n[[File:Trel 001.png|thumb|[[trill (music)|Trill]] sign\u2014a rapid alternation between two notes. [[File:Trill example ornaments.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn music, an \"ornament\" consists of added notes that provide decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. Performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]]. Different styles of music use different ornaments. A Baroque flute player might add [[mordent]]s, which are short notes that are played before the main melody note, either above or below the main melody note. A blues guitarist playing electric guitar might use string bending to add expression; a [[heavy metal guitar]] player might use [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s.\n\nIn the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this \"expressive\" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In popular music and traditional music styles, performers are expected to know what types of ornaments are stylistically appropriate for a given song or piece, and performers typically add them in an improvised fashion. One exception is note-for-note solos, in which some players precisely recreate a famous version of a solo, such as a [[guitar solo]].\n\n==Philosophy and aesthetics==\n{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}\n[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by [[Boldini]] of a woman playing the piano]]\n\n[[Philosophy of music]] is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].\nSome basic questions in the philosophy of music are:\n\n* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)\n* What is the relationship between music and mind?\n* What does [[music history]] reveal to us about the world?\n* What is the connection between music and emotions?\n* What is meaning in relation to music?\n\nIn ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the [[aesthetics of music]] explored the mathematical and [[cosmological]] dimensions of [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning [[sensory perception]], received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a [[music critic]] and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIt is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] suggests in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThere has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Psychology==\n{{Main|Music psychology}}\n\nModern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].<ref name = Tan>{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harr\u00e9 |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}</ref> Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[human subject research|human participants]].

These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).\n\n===Cognitive musicology===\n{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}\nCognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.<ref>{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ottolaskenavigat0000unse }}</ref> The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].<ref>Laske, O.

[https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27</ref> Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a \"[[high culture]]\" and \"[[low culture]].\" \"High culture\" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.\n\nOther types of music\u2014including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced \"art music\" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.\n\nHowever, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between \"high\" and \"low\" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-\"art\" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.\n\nWhen composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].\n\n===Role of women===\n{{Main|Women in music}}\n[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|right|19th-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]\nWomen have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.<ref>Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. \"Grunting Alone?

Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. \n\nSome musical styles focus on producing songs and pieces for a live performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played \"live.\" Even in essentially live styles such as rock, recording engineers often use the ability to [[Multitrack recording|edit, splice and mix]] to produce recordings that may be considered \"better\" than the actual live performance. For example, some singers record themselves singing a melody and then record multiple harmony parts using overdubbing, creating a sound that would be impossible to do live.\n\n[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. \n\nIn the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}</ref> During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.<ref>Hubbard (1985), p. 429.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}</ref> With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled \"Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever\"<ref>[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ \"Canned Music on Trial\"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.</ref>\n\nSince legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].\n\nIn many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often in a communal setting. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] on record or radio became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. By the 1980s, watching a [[music video]]s was a popular way to listen to music, while also seeing the performers.\n\nSometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[disc jockey]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded [[backing tracks]]. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.\n\n===Internet===\n\nThe advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.<ref>Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a \"[[prosumer]]\" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are \"[[independent record label|independent]],\" while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.\n\n===Intellectual property laws===\n{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}\nIn spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Non-professional===\n{{Main|Music education}}\n[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]\nThe incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.<ref>Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}</ref> In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.\n\nAt the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).\n\n===Professional training===\n[[File:TimothyBCobb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Manhattan School of Music]] professor and professional double bass player [[Timothy Cobb]] teaching a bass lesson in the late 2000s.

Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).\n\nWhile most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube \"how-to\" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.\n\n====Undergraduate====\n[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).\n\n====Graduate====\nGraduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.\n\nThe PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.\n\n====Musicology====\n[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.\n\n====Music theory====\n[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.\n\n====Zoomusicology====\n[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" [[Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage<!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech-->, musique, po\u00e9sie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that \"in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.\"\n\n====Ethnomusicology====\n{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}\n[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]\nIn the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures (\"[[world music]]\" or the field of \"ethnomusicology\"), which typically covers music from\nAfrica and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nThere is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or \"art\" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these \"big two\" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).\n\nAs world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic \"[[melting pot]]\" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].\n\n==Music therapy==\n{{Main|Music therapy}}\n[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a \"Blues in the Schools\" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]\n[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872\u2013950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357\u2013377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].<ref>cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, \"Music a Remedy\"</ref> He noted that music has an \"excellent power ...to expel many other diseases\" and he called it \"a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.\" He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to \"make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\"<ref>Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are\ntroubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

[[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the [[harmony of the spheres]]\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no [[noise]], only sound.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context.

''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.</ref> There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions\u2013such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nMusic can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.\n\nIn many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, [[sheet music]], and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, [[music criticism|music critics]], [[music journalism|music journalists]], and [[musicology|music scholars]] may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]\nThe word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]] (''mousike''; \"art of the [[Muses]]\").<ref name=\"perseus.tufts.edu\"/> In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture.

When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a \"self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.\"<ref>Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}</ref>\n\nAmateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.\n\nA distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Musical composition}}\n[[File:Coffee and synths.

In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music \"score\"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.\n\nEven when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.\n\nThe study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].\n\n===Notation===\n{{Main|Musical notation}}\n[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled \"[[Adeste Fideles]]\", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices.[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a \"slow blues\" or a \"fast swing\", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.\n\nWritten notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).\n\nIn Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz \"[[big band]]s.\" In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as \"tab\"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.\n\n===Improvisation===\n[[File:Johnny Hodges edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Improvisation plays a central role in jazz; musicians learn progressions using scale and chord tones (Pictured is [[Johnny Hodges]])]]\n{{Main|Musical improvisation}}\n[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or [[chord progression]]. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones not from the typical scales associated with a chord. Imorovisay on a song can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. \n\nIn the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as [[prelude]]s. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts.\n\nHowever, in the 20th and early 21st century, as \"common practice\" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century [[art music]] composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.\n\n===Theory===\n{{Main|Music theory}}\nMusic theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music \u2013 rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought\u2026 |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}</ref> People who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.\n\n==Elements==\n{{main|Aspect of music}}\nMusic has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the \"elements of music\":\n* Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure.<ref>ACARA. (2015).

Core music standards glossary. http://www.nafme.org/my-classroom/standards/core-music-standards /</ref>\n\nIn relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate [[musical notation]]s\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.<ref>Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"the elements of music\" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the \"rudimentary elements of music\" and the \"perceptual elements of music\".\n\n===Rudimentary elements===\nIn the 1800s, the phrases \"the elements of music\" and \"the rudiments of music\" were used interchangeably.<ref>[[Muzio Clementi|Clementi, M.]]: \"Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte\", Da Capo Press (1974).

In Dictionary.com unabridged. Retrieved 10 June 2015</ref> The UK's curriculum switch to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.\n\n===Perceptual elements===\nSince the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',<ref>Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.</ref> identified four \"psychological attributes of sound\". These were: \"pitch, loudness, time, and timbre\" (p.&nbsp;3). He did not call them the \"elements of music\" but referred to them as \"elemental components\" (p.&nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: \"Pitch\" and \"timbre\" match exactly, \"loudness\" links with dynamics and \"time\" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase \"the elements of music\" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: \"a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods\"<ref>Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.</ref> and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.\n\nAlthough writers of lists of \"rudimentary elements of music\" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.\n\n===Analysis of styles===\n[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]\nSome styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.\n\n===Description of elements===\n\n====Pitch and melody====\n[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.\n[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song \"[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]\"  [[File:Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|thumb]]]]\n\nA [[melody]] (also called a \"tune\") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the \"[[white notes]]\" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the \"white notes\" and \"black notes\" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].\n\n====Harmony and chords====\n[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]\u2013 three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]\n[[Harmony]] refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the \"home note\" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\n\n====Rhythm====\nRhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.\n\n====Texture====\n[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:\n* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or \"tune\") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.\n* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.\n* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as \"[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]\", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.\n* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.\n\nMusic that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a \"thicker\" or \"denser\" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).\n\n====Timbre or \"tone color\"====\n{{Main|Timbre}}\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\" or \"tone color\" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.<ref>Harnsberger, Lindsey. \"Articulation.\" ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.</ref> Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).\n\nThe physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].\n\n====Expression====\n[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]\nExpressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).\n\nExpression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey \"an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life.

Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:\n\n;Strophic form\nThis form is defined by its \"unrelieved repetition\" ('''AAAA'''...).\n\n;Medley\n\n[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of \"unrelieved variation\": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.\n\n;Binary form\n[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.<ref>White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, \"simple binary\" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.\nb\n;Ternary form\nThis form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. \"repeat from the top\") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the \"middle eight\". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.\n\n;Rondo form\nThis form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called \"episodes\". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a \"development\" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.\n\n;Variational form\nVariational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.\n\n'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only \"section\" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] \u2013 a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA<sup>1</sup>BA<sup>2</sup>CA<sup>3</sup>BA<sup>4</sup>''') or ('''ABA<sup>1</sup>CA<sup>2</sup>B<sup>1</sup>A''').\n\n;Developmental form\nDevelopmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].\n\nThis form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|date=September 2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the \"A\" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the \"B\" part (the [[musical development|development]]) \u2013 thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A<sup>1</sup>ab<sup>1</sup>+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as [[Berlioz]], [[Liszt]] and [[Wagner]] made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of music}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|A bone flute which is over 41,000 years old.]]\n\n[[Prehistoric music]] can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites.

Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\n\n===Baroque===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]].

(Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],<ref>Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1970. Print.</ref> where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses).\n\nImportance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.\n\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.\n\nThe best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\n\n===Romanticism===\n[[File:Moritz von Schwind Schubertiade.jpg|thumb|230px|The piano was the centrepiece of social activity for middle-class urbanites in the 19th century ([[Moritz von Schwind]], 1868).

Wagner]]<br /><small>[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:silver;\"|[[File:Wagner - die walkure fantasie.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.\n\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound \"colours\". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===20th and 21st century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n\nIn the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.\n\nThe focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]<ref>Schaeffer, P. (1966), Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.</ref> and [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.\n\n[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].<ref>Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nRock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].<ref>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 \u2013 Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things|show=55}}{{Time needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]]. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its \"purest form\", it \"has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody\".{{Cite quote|date=February 2020}} The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands also have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the [[DX-7]] synthesizer, electronic [[drum machine]]s such as the [[TR-808]] and synth bass devices (such as the [[TB-303]]) or [[synth bass]] keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g., [[digital audio workstation]]s)  were used. In the 2020s, [[soft synth]]s and computer music apps make it possible for [[bedroom producers]] to create and record some types of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] in their own home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, some bands in genres such as [[nu metal]] began including [[DJ]]s in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music on record players or CD players, using a [[DJ mixer]].\n\n==Performance==\n{{Main|Performance}}\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]\n[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]\nPerformance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.\n\nA performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles\u2013or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea\u2013a melody or other musical line\u2013created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.\n\nMany cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.\n\n===Oral and aural tradition===\nMany types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]\". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as \"traditional\" or as a \"folk song\". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.\n\n===Ornamentation===\n{{Main|Ornament (music)}}\n[[File:Trel 001.png|thumb|[[trill (music)|Trill]] sign\u2014a rapid alternation between two notes. [[File:Trill example ornaments.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn music, an \"ornament\" consists of added notes that provide decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. Performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]]. Different styles of music use different ornaments. A Baroque flute player might add [[mordent]]s, which are short notes that are played before the main melody note, either above or below the main melody note. A blues guitarist playing electric guitar might use string bending to add expression; a [[heavy metal guitar]] player might use [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s.\n\nIn the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this \"expressive\" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In popular music and traditional music styles, performers are expected to know what types of ornaments are stylistically appropriate for a given song or piece, and performers typically add them in an improvised fashion. One exception is note-for-note solos, in which some players precisely recreate a famous version of a solo, such as a [[guitar solo]].\n\n==Philosophy and aesthetics==\n{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}\n[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by [[Boldini]] of a woman playing the piano]]\n\n[[Philosophy of music]] is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].\nSome basic questions in the philosophy of music are:\n\n* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)\n* What is the relationship between music and mind?\n* What does [[music history]] reveal to us about the world?\n* What is the connection between music and emotions?\n* What is meaning in relation to music?\n\nIn ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the [[aesthetics of music]] explored the mathematical and [[cosmological]] dimensions of [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning [[sensory perception]], received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a [[music critic]] and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIt is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] suggests in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThere has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Psychology==\n{{Main|Music psychology}}\n\nModern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].<ref name = Tan>{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harr\u00e9 |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}</ref> Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[human subject research|human participants]].

These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).\n\n===Cognitive musicology===\n{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}\nCognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.<ref>{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ottolaskenavigat0000unse }}</ref> The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].<ref>Laske, O.

Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a \"[[high culture]]\" and \"[[low culture]].\" \"High culture\" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.\n\nOther types of music\u2014including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced \"art music\" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.\n\nHowever, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between \"high\" and \"low\" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-\"art\" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.\n\nWhen composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].\n\n===Role of women===\n{{Main|Women in music}}\n[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|right|19th-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]\nWomen have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.<ref>Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. \"Grunting Alone?

Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. \n\nSome musical styles focus on producing songs and pieces for a live performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played \"live.\" Even in essentially live styles such as rock, recording engineers often use the ability to [[Multitrack recording|edit, splice and mix]] to produce recordings that may be considered \"better\" than the actual live performance. For example, some singers record themselves singing a melody and then record multiple harmony parts using overdubbing, creating a sound that would be impossible to do live.\n\n[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. \n\nIn the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}</ref> During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.<ref>Hubbard (1985), p. 429.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}</ref> With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled \"Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever\"<ref>[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ \"Canned Music on Trial\"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.</ref>\n\nSince legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].\n\nIn many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often in a communal setting. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] on record or radio became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. By the 1980s, watching a [[music video]]s was a popular way to listen to music, while also seeing the performers.\n\nSometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[disc jockey]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded [[backing tracks]]. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.\n\n===Internet===\n\nThe advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.<ref>Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a \"[[prosumer]]\" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are \"[[independent record label|independent]],\" while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.\n\n===Intellectual property laws===\n{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}\nIn spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Non-professional===\n{{Main|Music education}}\n[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]\nThe incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.<ref>Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}</ref> In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.\n\nAt the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).\n\n===Professional training===\n[[File:TimothyBCobb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Manhattan School of Music]] professor and professional double bass player [[Timothy Cobb]] teaching a bass lesson in the late 2000s. His bass has a low C extension with a metal \"machine\" with buttons for playing the pitches on the extension.]]\nIndividuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).\n\nWhile most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube \"how-to\" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.\n\n====Undergraduate====\n[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).\n\n====Graduate====\nGraduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.\n\nThe PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.\n\n====Musicology====\n[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.\n\n====Music theory====\n[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.\n\n====Zoomusicology====\n[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" [[Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage<!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech-->, musique, po\u00e9sie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that \"in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.\"\n\n====Ethnomusicology====\n{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}\n[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]\nIn the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures (\"[[world music]]\" or the field of \"ethnomusicology\"), which typically covers music from\nAfrica and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nThere is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or \"art\" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these \"big two\" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).\n\nAs world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic \"[[melting pot]]\" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].\n\n==Music therapy==\n{{Main|Music therapy}}\n[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a \"Blues in the Schools\" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]\n[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872\u2013950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357\u2013377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].<ref>cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, \"Music a Remedy\"</ref> He noted that music has an \"excellent power ...to expel many other diseases\" and he called it \"a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.\" He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to \"make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\"<ref>Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are\ntroubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

Initially, mail services were handled by the military authorities and then by the Master Attendant in 1823.  The volume of mail was very small in those days and letters were collected and delivered from a single mail office.  The Post Office, as it was then known, shared a room with the Master Attendant's Marine Office and the clerk to the Registrar of Import and Export.  The whole establishment of the post office in the 1830s consisted of one European clerk, one local writer and a peon.\n\nTo cope with the increasing volume of mail, the Post Office, then known as the Singapore Post Office, later General Post Office, was moved in 1854 to its own building near the Town Hall by the side of the Singapore River.  Although it was more spacious, there were frequent complaints regarding its location.  The Commercial Square (business sector) was on the opposite side of the river, so going to the Post office was inconvenient as one had to cross the river by boat. After 1856, a footbridge was constructed across the river and a toll of {{frac|1|4}} cent was levied.\n\nAs trade flourished in Singapore and both postal and marine traffic grew heavier, the Post Office was separated from the Marine Office and it became a separate department in October 1858.  During the period 1819 and 1858, letters for posting had to be handed in at the Post Office.  No postage stamps were used but a register was kept of all letters received at the Post Office and of the names of sailing ships on which they were conveyed.\n\nStamped receipts were also given for all letters sent to the Post Office for dispatch.  For the convenience of the residents, a register was kept of their individual postage accounts on the understanding that all postage due would be regularly settled every month.  The first postage stamps were introduced for payment of postage only in 1854.  In the early days, the flagstaff at Government Hill (now Fort Canning) was eagerly watched as flying of a flag at daylight, or the firing of a gun at night, signified the arrival of a ship with mail.  This infused new life into the quiet community.\n\nOn receipt of letters from incoming ships, the Post Office sorters would proceed to register alphabetically all the letters before sending them out through the postmen for delivery.  Postal delivery services by means of bullock cart, horse carriage or on foot, were first restricted to the town area.  Posting boxes were later installed in the town area for the posting of mail which were then collected by horse-drawn mail coaches.\n\nIn 1873, a new General Post office was built on the site of the former Fort Fullerton, a location which was much nearer to the commercial centre of the town.  However, the British Government failed to foresee the needs of the future, with the result that the building had to be replaced by another on practically the same site.  The new General Post Office was completed in 1885, three years after approval was obtained.\n\nThe General Post Office was closed on 23 April 1921.  All the equipment were moved to a building on the recently reclaimed land at Collyer Quay, and staff worked at this temporary post office during the construction of Fullerton Building.  The post office was transferred back to Fullerton Building on 23 July 1928 and has remained there since.\n\nThe latter part of the 19th century marked the modern phase of the development in the history of the Singapore postal service.  Services were extended to include a parcel post service, money order and postal order services and a post office savings bank.  1897 saw the establishment of the first sub-post offices, and by 1938, some 20 sub-post offices were already providing decentralised postal facilities on the island.  The horse-drawn mail coaches were withdrawn and replaced by motor vans in 1914 as the mail traffic handled steadily increased.\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1982, the Postal Services Department merged with the then ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'', also known as Telecoms.\n\nIn 1992, the ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'' was split into three entities:\n# The reconstituted Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS, now part of the [[Infocomm Media Development Authority]] (IMDA))\n# Singapore Telecommunications Limited (now [[Singtel]]) and\n# Singapore Post Private Limited, an associated company of Singapore Telecommunications (as of Jun 2012).\n\nSingapore Post Limited was listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX-ST) on 13 May 2003.\n<!--The company was incorporated on [[28 March 1992]], and listed on 13 May 2003-->\nSingapore Post is the first Public Postal Licensee. TAS granted the licence in 1992 in accordance with section 42 of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Act 1992. As a licensee, Singapore Post is empowered to operate postal services with the exclusive privilege of receiving, collecting and delivering letters and postcards from one place to another until 31 March 2007.\n\nSingPost was fined S$100,000 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-100000-for-failing-to-meet-local-mail-delivery-standards-in-2017|title=SingPost fined $100k for failing to meet local mail delivery standards in 2017|date=7 February 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> and S$300,000 in 2018<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-record-300000-for-failing-to-meet-2018-service-standards|title=SingPost fined record $300,000 for failing to meet service standards in 2018|date=29 March 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> for failing to meet mail delivery standards by IMDA.\n\n==Growth==\nSingPost has made several acquisitions to strengthen and grow its business. In 2009, it acquired the remaining 50% stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac (G3AP),<ref>{{cite web|title=SingPost acquires stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac|url=http://postandparcel.info/23900/news/singpost-acquires-stake-in-g3-worldwide-aspac/}}</ref> thereby giving the company presence in 10 countries (including Singapore).

Both parties also signed an agreement to pursue a joint venture in the business of e-commerce logistics.\n\nIn October 2015, SingPost acquired a 96.3 per cent stake in TradeGlobal for US$168.6 million (S$230 million), thereby expanding its e-commerce footprint in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpost-acquires-us-e/2193930.html|title=SingPost acquires US e-commerce provider TradeGlobal for S$236m|accessdate=22 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041444/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpost-acquires-us-e/2193930.html|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of Singapore]]\n*[[Postal codes in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.singpost.com/ Singapore Post Limited official website]\n*[http://quantiumsolutions.com/ Quantium Solutions official website]\n*[http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-its-the-postman Singapore Drone Mail Delivery Trial]\n{{Postal administrations of Asia}}\n\n[[Category:Postal organizations]]\n[[Category:Logistics companies of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Postal system of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1819]]\n[[Category:Singaporean brands]]\n[[Category:Philately of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Government-owned companies of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Singapore domestic and international postal service provider}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox government agency\n| agency_name = Singapore Post\n| nativename =\n| nativename_a =\n| nativename_r =\n| type = Agency\n| seal =\n| seal_width =\n| seal_caption =\n| logo = Singapore Post Logo.svg\n| logo_width =\n| logo_caption = Singapore Post logo\n| picture = Singapore Post Headquarters (2336054323).jpg\n| picture_width =\n| picture_caption = Singapore Post headquarters\n| formed = {{start date and age|df=y|1819}} (as Singapore Post Office)<br/ >{{start date and age|df=y|1992|04|01}} (as Singapore Post)\n| jurisdiction = Singapore\n| headquarters = [[Paya Lebar]], [[Singapore]]\n| employees = \n| budget =\n| chief1_name = Simon Israel\n| chief1_position = Chairman\n| chief2_name = Paul William Coutts\n| chief2_position = Group Chief Executive Officer\n| chief3_name =\n| chief3_position =\n| chief4_name =\n| chief4_position =\n| chief5_name =\n| chief5_position =\n| chief6_name =\n| chief6_position =\n| chief7_name =\n| chief7_position =\n| chief8_name =\n| chief8_position =\n| chief9_name =\n| chief9_position =\n| parent_department =\n| parent_agency =\n| child1_agency =\n| child2_agency = <!-- (etc.) -->\n| keydocument1 = \n<!-- (etc.) -->| website = {{URL|https://www.singpost.com}}\n| map =\n| map_width =\n| map_caption =\n| footnotes =\n| agency_type = \n| embed = {{Infobox\n|bodystyle   = width:100%\n | data1 = {{Infobox | decat = yes | child = yes\n    | label1= \n    | data1 = \n   }}\n | data2 = {{Infobox | decat = yes | child = yes\n  | label1= \n  | data1 = \n  }}\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Singapore Post Limited''', commonly abbreviated as '''SingPost''', is a [[mail|postal service]] and [[courier]] company in [[Singapore]], originally established in 1819.

As a licensee, Singapore Post is empowered to operate postal services with the exclusive privilege of receiving, collecting and delivering letters and postcards from one place to another until 31 March 2007.\n\nSingPost was fined S$100,000 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-100000-for-failing-to-meet-local-mail-delivery-standards-in-2017|title=SingPost fined $100k for failing to meet local mail delivery standards in 2017|date=7 February 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> and S$300,000 in 2018<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-record-300000-for-failing-to-meet-2018-service-standards|title=SingPost fined record $300,000 for failing to meet service standards in 2018|date=29 March 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> for failing to meet mail delivery standards by IMDA.\n\n==Growth==\nSingPost has made several acquisitions to strengthen and grow its business. In 2009, it acquired the remaining 50% stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac (G3AP),<ref>{{cite web|title=SingPost acquires stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac|url=http://postandparcel.info/23900/news/singpost-acquires-stake-in-g3-worldwide-aspac/}}</ref> thereby giving the company presence in 10 countries (including Singapore).

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (\u00a312,930 per annum in 2019/20). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has also refurbished its original Lecture Theatre extending and enhancing facilities within a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010 with an event attended by the author Alan Bennett and OM Sir Nicholas Hytner.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J.

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]].

''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (\u00a312,930 per annum in 2019/20). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has replaced its original Lecture Theatre with a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J.

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April 1, the Australian

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April 1, the Australian

A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.

On the escutcheon it is depicted as casting a net into the ocean referencing [[Matthew 4]]:18-19:<blockquote>''\"As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.

The mountains depicted are intended to represent the [[Hollyburn]], [[Grouse Mountain|Grouse]] and [[Mount Seymour|Seymour]] mountaintops.\n\n'''The Barque of St. Peter'''\n\nThe [[Barque of St. Peter]], the ship, symbolises the church. On the escutcheon it is depicted as casting a net into the ocean referencing [[Matthew 4]]:18-19:<blockquote>''\"As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

As complete as possible removal of the tumor visible on the MRI is preferred, provided the location of the tumor allows this. Since the cells of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma have already migrated into the surrounding healthy brain tissue at the time of diagnosis, a complete surgical removal of all tumor cells is not possible. The \"1p / 19q Codeletion\" marker plays an increasingly important role in the selection of therapy and therapy combinations.\nBecause of the indolent nature of this tumor and the potential [[morbidity]] associated with [[neurosurgery]], [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]], most [[oncology|neurooncologists]] will initially pursue a course of [[watchful waiting]] and treat patients symptomatically.  Symptomatic treatment often includes the use of [[anticonvulsants]] for seizures and [[Glucocorticoid|steroids]] for [[oedema|brain swelling]]. For further treatment, radiation or chemotherapy with temozolomide or a chemotherapy with [[Procarbazine]], [[Lomustine|CCNU]] and [[Vincristine]] (PCV) has been shown to be effective and was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen used for treating anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.<ref name=SwissBrain/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Engelhard HH, Stelea A, Mundt A |title=Oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma: clinical features, treatment, and prognosis |journal=Surg Neurol |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=443\u201356 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14572971 |doi=10.1016/s0090-3019(03)00167-8 |url=}}</ref>\n\n== Prognosis ==\n5\u2013Year relative survival rate: Age 20\u201344, 71%.

It can be seen as favorable for the patient and makes a response to radiation or chemotherapy more likely.<ref name=SwissBrain/> The designation of grade III oligodendroglioma (high grade) generally subsumes the previous diagnoses of anaplastic or malignant oligodendroglioma.<ref name=Louis2007/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=packed heights=200px>\nAnaplastic oligodendroglioma (1).jpg|Histopathological image of anaplastic oligodendroglioma in cerebrum.

As complete as possible removal of the tumor visible on the MRI is preferred, provided the location of the tumor allows this. Since the cells of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma have already migrated into the surrounding healthy brain tissue at the time of diagnosis, a complete surgical removal of all tumor cells is not possible. The \"1p / 19q Codeletion\" marker plays an increasingly important role in the selection of therapy and therapy combinations.\nBecause of the indolent nature of this tumor and the potential [[morbidity]] associated with [[neurosurgery]], [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]], most [[oncology|neurooncologists]] will initially pursue a course of [[watchful waiting]] and treat patients symptomatically.  Symptomatic treatment often includes the use of [[anticonvulsants]] for seizures and [[Glucocorticoid|steroids]] for [[oedema|brain swelling]]. For further treatment, radiation or chemotherapy with temozolomide or a chemotherapy with [[Procarbazine]], [[Lomustine|CCNU]] and [[Vincristine]] (PCV) has been shown to be effective and was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen used for treating anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.<ref name=SwissBrain/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Engelhard HH, Stelea A, Mundt A |title=Oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma: clinical features, treatment, and prognosis |journal=Surg Neurol |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=443\u201356 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14572971 |doi=10.1016/s0090-3019(03)00167-8 |url=}}</ref>\n\n== Prognosis ==\n5\u2013Year relative survival rate: Age 20\u201344, 71%.
