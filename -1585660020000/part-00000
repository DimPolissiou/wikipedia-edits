The smallest American Ford vehicle since 1907, the Pinto was the first subcompact vehicle produced by Ford in North America.\n\nThe Pinto was marketed in three body styles through its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon.  [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the '''Mercury Bobcat''' from 1975 to 1980 (1974\u20131980 in Canada<ref>Mays, James C. ''Ford and Canada: 100 Years Together'' (Montr\u00e9al: Syam Publishing, 2003). p.116.</ref>). From 1974 to 1978, the [[Ford Mustang (second generation)|Ford Mustang II]] shared a common platform with the Pinto and Bobcat, though with a different unibody and powertrain assortment.  For the 1981 model year, the Pinto was replaced by the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], as Ford moved its product line towards front-wheel drive. Over 3 million Pintos were produced over its 10-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevy Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at [[Edison Assembly]] 1n Edison, New Jersey, [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Southwold, Ontario, and [[San Jose Assembly Plant|San Jose Assembly]] in Milpitas, California.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/25/HOG2UHS4701.DTL|title=Lofty ambition / Developer revs up former Ford factory in Richmond for real live-work spaces|last=Smith|first=Charles|date=March 25, 2006|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>  \n\nSince the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has been surrounded by controversy.  Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires related to the tanks rupturing in rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars.  The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as a [[business ethics]] as well as [[tort reform]] case study.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Gremlin-Pinto-Vega in 2010.JPG|thumb|left|First-generation American subcompacts, left to right: AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto, Chevrolet Vega]]\n\nAmerican automakers had first countered imports such as the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with vehicles [[compact car]]s including the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]], although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class.

Unlike most 1970s cars, the addition of larger bumpers to the Pinto did not necessitate major changes to the bodywork.  While the underpowered Kent engine was dropped, the optional OHC engine was expanded to 2.3L; in various forms this engine powered a variety of Ford vehicles for 23 years.  In 1974, Mercury began selling a rebadged version of the Pinto called Bobcat as a Canada-only model. 544,209 units sold; 1974 became the most popular model year for the Pinto.<ref name=\"Ford 2007\"/> Steel-belted tires, an anti-theft alarm system, and metallic glow paint were optional.<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---March/1974-Ford-Pinto-Brochure-Rev/1974-Ford-Pinto-Rev--10-11</ref>\n\nIn 1975, in a move to better compete with the AMC Gremlin, Ford introduced the 2.8L V6; while far less powerful than the Gremlin, the V6 gave the Pinto a feature unavailable in the Chevrolet Vega.

Ford was accused of knowing the car had an unsafe tank placement then forgoing design changes based on an internal cost-benefit analysis.  Two landmark legal cases, ''[[Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.]]'' and ''[[Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', resulted from fatal accidents involving Pintos.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Conventional wisdom holds that Ford Motor Company decided to rush the Pinto into production in 1970 to compete with compact foreign imports, despite internal pre-production tests that showed gas tank ruptures in low-speed rear-end collisions would produce deadly fires.  This decision purportedly derived from an infamous seven-page cost-benefit analysis (the \"Grush/Saunby Report\" [1973]) that valued human lives at $200,000.  Settling burn victims' lawsuits would have cost $49.5 million, far less than the $137 million needed to make minor corrections.

The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]], initially only considered front impacts.  In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions.  The proposed standard was based on a 20&nbsp;mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20&nbsp;mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard.<ref name=Rossow>{{cite news |last1=Rossow |first1=Mark |title=Ethics: An Alternative Account of the Ford Pinto Case|publisher=Continuing Education and Development Inc. |date=2015 |quote='Fixed-barrier' meant that the vehicle was moving (towed backwards) into a stationary barrier&nbsp;...

This situation changed in the marketing stage (post 1970). Shortly after the 1971 model year Pintos were released, Ford adopted an internal20 mile-per-hour moving barrier standard for the 1973 model year-the only manufacturer to do so (Gioia 1996; Strobel 1994). The extant legal/regulatory environment reinforced engineers' beliefs that this standard was quite reasonable\" since it was the \"same one recommended at that time by the federal General Services Administration; the Canadian equivalent of the GSA; the Society of Automotive Engineers; and a private consulting firm hired by NHTSA&nbsp;...\" and by NHTSA itself in 1969 (Strobel 1980:205). This standard would constrain future debates by certifying the Pinto as safe\" to Ford's subunit charged with evaluating potential recallable safety problems.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1970, 1971 model-year Pintos began coming off the assembly line. Just a few days later, NHTSA-which had never acted on its earlier proposal-advanced a more demanding set of proposed regulations. Three months later, Ford officials decided that for purposes of the 1973 model year, Ford would adopt, as its own internal objective, the regulations that NHTSA had suggested in 1969. In order to respond to NHTSA's more recent proposal, Ford engineers, with actual Pintos now available, stepped up the crash-testing process, and identified a. number of design modifications that might imp:rove the Pinto's performance. In October 1971, Ford officials decided against incorporating any of these modifications into current Pintos; rather, it would wait until NHTSA clarified its position. In 1973, NHTSA promulgated its fuel-tank standard but ruled that this standard would apply only to 1977 models.  Ford adopted a 20&nbsp;mph moving-barrier standard for all 1973 cars.</ref>  Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.<ref>{{harvnb|Strobel|1979}}: Ford then joined other automakers in an aggressive lobbying campaign that was successful in delaying and softening proposed federal standards on how strong fuel systems must be to resist rupture an potential explosion.</ref>\n\nThe Pinto's design positioned its fuel tank between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: The tank was positioned between the rear bumper and the rear axle (a standard industry practice for the time).</ref> The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and fire in a rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear \"crush space\", a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an \"essentially ornamental\" rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers).<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:Page 1015 and Footnote 9, \"The court of appeal opinion referred to the Pinto's bumper as the flimsiest of any American car.

In the later criminal case, however, Byron Bloch, a prosecution witness, stated in cross-examination that the Pinto's bumper was about the same as those of the Gremlin, Vega, and Dodge Colt. See L. STROBEL, supra note 5, at 157 (\"I would say they were all bad.\").\"</ref>  Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, as part of a response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds.  Design changes were made, but post-launch tests showed similar results.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: A few months later Ford began crash-testing modified Mavericks in part to prepare a response to NHTSA's proposed regulations.  The results demonstrated vulnerability of fuel-integrity at fairly low speeds and some modifications were made. In August of 1970, the first model year Pinto, the 1971, went into production. Post-production testing revealed similar results. Still, there were no federal performance standards at the time and the proposed regulations addressed only front-end collisions.</ref> These tests were conducted to develop crash testing standards rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity.  Though Ford engineers were not pleased with the car's performance, no reports of the time indicate particular concern.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: engineers in the design stage were still trying \"to find out how to conduct crash tests\" (Feaheny 1997; see also Lacey 1986:613). For example, an internal Pinto test report dated November, 1970 listed as its objective \"To develop a test procedure to be used to provide baseline data on vehicle fuel system integrity\" (NHTSA C7-38-Al.5, Final Test Report #T-0738). In this test, a Pinto sedan exhibited \"excessive fuel tank leakage\" when towed rearward into a fixed barrier at 21.5 miles per hour, considered roughly equivalent to a car-to-car impact at 35 miles per hour.  Nothing in this, or any other, Ford test report indicates that participants felt cause for concern or organizational action. Although some Ford engineers were not especially pleased, they felt that the data were inconclusive or the risks acceptable (Feaheny 1997; Strobel 1980), or they kept their concerns to themselves (Camps 1997). Some felt that cars would rarely be subjected to the extreme forces generated in a fixed-barrier test in real-world collisions (Feaheny 1997; Devine 1996). NHTSA apparently agreed and ultimately replaced the proposed fixedbarrier test with a less-stringent moving-barrier test in its final standard (U.S. Department of Transportation 1988)</ref>\nFord also tested several different vehicle modifications which could improve rear impact performance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: Ford had in fact crash-tested 11 vehicles; 8 of these cars suffered potentially catastrophic gas tank ruptures. The only 3 cars that survived intact had each been modified in some way to protect the tank.</ref> However, the engineer's occupational caution and aversion to \"unproven\" solutions as well as a view that the crash test results were inconclusive resulted in the use of a conventional fuel tank design and placement.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Occupational caution encouraged engineers to view many design adjustments that improved test performance as \"unproven\" in real-world accidents (Devine 1996; Feaheny 1997; Schwartz 1991; Strickland 1996; Strobel 1980). Engineers, who typically value \"uncertainty avoidance\" (Allison 1971:72 ), chose to stick with an existing design rather than face uncertainties associated with novel ones (Devine 1996; Strobel 1980). One series of tests, for instance, showed that Pintos equipped with pliable foam-like gas tanks would not leak in 30 mile-per-hour crashes. But some engineers feared that such a tank might melt and disagreed with others who felt it was safer than the existing metal design (Devine 1996, see also Strobel\n1980). Other engineers believed that rubber bladders improved performance in tests, but anticipated problems under real-world conditions (Strobel 1980).</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a \"tank within the tank\"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970s, but also rebuttal testimony that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility.</ref>  The use of an above-the-axle tank location was considered safer by some, but not all, at Ford.  This placement was not a viable option for the hatchback and station wagon body styles.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Ford whistle-blower Harley Copp's argument-that the Pinto would have been safer had its\ngas tank been placed above the axle rather than behind it-is often cited in Pinto narratives as an example of safety being sacrificed to profits, or at least trunk space, in the design stage (Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987; Dowie 1977; Strobel1994). Yet Copp did not reach this conclusion until 1977 (Strobel1980). And other engineers were considerably less certain about it, even though the above-the-axle design did perform better in one set of crash tests. The engineer overseeing the Pinto's design, Harold MacDonald (whose father died in a fuel tank fire when his Model A Ford exploded after a frontal collision with a tree), felt that the above-the axle placement was less safe under real-world conditions because the tank was closer to the passenger compartment and more likely to be punctured by items in the trunk (Strobel1980).</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1973, field reports of Ford Pintos consumed by fire after low-speed rear-end collisions were received by Ford's recall coordinator office.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: I began to construct my own files of incoming safety problems. One of these new files concerned reports of Pintos \"lighting up\"  (in the words of a field representative) in rear-end accidents. There were actually very few reports, perhaps because component failure was not initially assumed. These cars simply were consumed by fire after apparently very low speed accidents.</ref>  Based on standard procedures used to evaluate field reports, Ford's internal recall evaluation group twice reviewed the field data and found no actionable issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: When Gioia became Recall Coordinator, he inherited about 100 active recall campaigns, half of them safety-related. As with most jobs, the enormous workload required him to use standard operating procedures\" (SOPs) to organize and manage information for decision making (d. Kriesberg 1976:1102). SOPs increase organizational efficiency by operating as cognitive scripts that transform decision-making opportunities into largely predetermined action patterns. Existing SOPs required that, to be \"recallable,\" problems needed either high frequency or a directly traceable causal link to a design defect. When reports began to trickle in to Gioia that Pintos were \"lighting up\" in relatively low speed accidents, and after viewing the burned wreckage of a Pinto, he initiated a meeting to determine if this represented a recallable problem. His work group voted unanimously not to recall the Pinto because the weak data did not meet SOP criteria (Gioia 1996). The work group was unaware of any cost-benefit analyses or Pinto crash test results. Reports of Pinto fires continued to trickle in, and eventually Gioia did become aware of, and concerned about, the crash test results. Again he wondered if the Pinto had a recallable problem, so he initiated a second meeting to convince his co-workers that crash tests showed a possible design flaw. But others again saw no design flaws\u2014after all, the Pinto met internal company standards, and no contradictory external standard existed. The work group conceived the tank leak \"problem\" not as a defect, but as a fundamental and unalterable design feature: the car's small size, the use of light metals, and unibody construction produced a tendency for Pintos (and others in its class) to \"crush up like an accordion\" in rear-end collisions (Gioia 1996).</ref>\n\n=== Cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Pinto Memo ===\n\nIn 1973, Ford's Environmental and Safety Engineering division developed a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] entitled ''Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires'' for submission to the NHTSA in support of Ford's objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation.<ref name=PintoMemo>{{cite report |title=Fatalities Associated With Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires |first1=E.S. |last1=Grush |first2=C.S. |last2=Saundy |publisher=Ford Environmental and Safety Engineering |url=http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/import/phpq3mJ7F_FordMemo.pdf |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> The document became known as the \"Pinto Memo\".

The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: In calculating the benefits, the analysis used a figure of $200,000 per life.  NHTSA had developed this figure in 1972.</ref>  In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million.  The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a benefit to society of $49.5 million.\n\nIn August 1977, having been provided with a copy of the memo by ''[[Grimshaw v.

The common belief is that the Pinto, on account of its fuel-tank design, was a \"firetrap.\" The Mother Jones article derived emotional power from its presentation of the Pinto as a \"firetrap,'' a \"death trap,\" and a \"lethal car.\"47 The combination of that article, the verdict in the Ford Pinto case, the NHTSA initial determination, and the Pinto recall clearly conveyed this sense of the Pinto-as-firetrap to the general public.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Dowie (1977) accurately explains in part of his Mother Jones article that Ford employees wrote this document as part of an ongoing lobbying effort to influence NHTSA (24, 28).

A large \"bullet car\" was used instead of a standard moving barrier. Weights were placed in the nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable [[Stoddard solvent|Stoddard fluid]] as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview, the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35&nbsp;mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed. \"Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: NHTSA engineer Lee Strickland was assigned to determine if Pinto (and Chevrolet Vega) tank problems warranted a mandatory recall. Strickland's work group held the Pinto and Vega to a higher standard than other cars (Strickland 1996). It dispensed with the usual moving barrier. Instead, it intentionally selected a large and particularly rigid \"bullet car\" to hit the Pinto's rear end. It weighed down the bullet car's nose to slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. It also turned on the bullet car's headlights to provide a ready source of ignition. And it completely filled gas tanks in both cars with gasoline rather than the non-flammable Stoddard fluid normally used. Strickland justified these actions as approximating real-world worst-case circumstances (Davidson 1983; NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). For NHTSA, the tests seemed an unqualified success: two 1972 Pintos burst into flame upon impact. In the summer of 1978 NHTSA announced that the Pinto gas tank represented a safety defect, leading to the largest recall campaign in automobile history at that time (NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). Ford agreed to \"voluntarily\" recall 1971\u20131976 Pintos. Other small cars sold during the 19 70s were not recalled, even though most were comparable, or in the case of the AMC Gremlin probably less safe (Schwartz 1991; NHTSA C7-38; Swigert and Farrell 198081:180). Their manufacturers successfully defended them as acceptable risks (see Wallace 1978). When we asked why NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing the 35 mile-per-hour test, although most small cars could not withstand such a test, Strickland ( 1996) analogized that, \"Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too.\"</ref><ref name=\"Lee1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Matthew T|title=The Ford Pinto Case and the Development of Auto Safety Regulations, 1893\u20141978|journal=Business and Economic History|date=1998|volume=27|issue=2|pages=390\u2013401}}</ref>\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ultimately directed Ford to recall the Pinto. Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. The NHTSA investigation found that 27 deaths were found to have occurred between 1970 and mid-1977 in rear-impact crashes that resulted in fire.  The NHTSA did not indicate if these impacts would have been survivable absent fire or if the impacts were more severe than even a state of the art (for 1977) fuel system could have withstood.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: Relying on a variety of external sources (including Ford), NHTSA indicated that it was aware of thirty-eight instances in which rear-end impact on Pintos had resulted in fuel-tank leakage or fire; these instances, in turn, resulted in twenty-seven deaths and twenty-four nonfatal burn injuries.66 The NHTSA report also incorporated the data internally provided by NHTSA's own Fatal Accident Reporting System (\"FARS\"), which had begun operation in 1975. FARS data showed that from January 1975 through the middle of 1977, seventeen people had died in accidents in which Pinto rear-end collisions resulted in fires. 67 In comparing NHTSA's figure of twenty-seven deaths for 1971\u201377 with the FARS figure of seventeen for 1975\u201377,68 one should keep in mind that the number of Pintos on the road was increasing every year in a cumulative way. The NHTSA figure of twenty-seven fatalities hence seems roughly in the ballpark by way of suggesting the number of people who had died in Pinto rear-end fires. In setting forth this number, however, NHTSA made no effort to estimate how many of these deaths were caused by the Pinto's specific design features. Many fire deaths undeniably result from high-speed collisions that would induce leakage even in state-of-the-art fuel systems;69 moreover, cars in the subcompact class generally entail a relatively high fatality risk.70 Yet the NHTSA report did not compare the performance results of the Pinto to the results of other cars then on the road, including other subcompacts.</ref>  In their analysis of the social factors affecting the NHTSA's actions, Lee and Ermann note that 27 is the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem which contributed to collisions after the affected cars stalled.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:Beginning in the late 1970s, claims consistent with \"Pinto Madness\" readily gained public acceptance, but credible contradictory claims did not (e.g., Davidson 1983; Epstein 1980). For instance, Dowie's \"conservative\" estimate of 500 deaths (1977:18) was accepted, while NHTSA's report that it could document only 27 Pinto fire-related deaths (NHTSA C7-38; Frank 1985) was ignored. A transmission problem that also caused 27 Pinto deaths (and 180 on other Ford products [Clarke 1988]) never became a social problem. Similarly, publics accepted claims of safety errors leveled by Harley Copp, a Ford engineer who was apparently overseas when early crucial decisions were made (Camps 1997; Strobel 1980), but ignored other safety-conscious Pinto engineers who believed windshield retention was a more important safety problem (Camps 1997), and lack of safety glass caused more deaths (Feaheny 1997).</ref>  They also note that the NHTSA had two primary incentives in proving a defect existed in the Pinto's fuel system design.  The administration was pressured by safety advocates (Center for Auto Safety) as well as the public response.  It was also being forced into action due to the ways in which both the courts and executive branch were limiting the ability of the NHTSA to address systematic auto safety issues.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: By the time of its Pinto investigation, NHTSA had essentially abandoned its original mission of forcing industry-wide safety improvements, in favor of investigating and recalling specific cars (Mashaw and Harfst 1990). NHTSA had two primary incentives in reinforcing the extant Nfocal organization\" imagery of the Pinto narrative. First, NHTSA was pressured by specific organizations in its network (e.g., the Center for Auto Safety) and members of the public (see NHTSA C7-38) to take action on the Pinto's gas tank. Second, other network actors (e.g., courts, the Nixon administration, the auto industry) had increasingly limited NHTSA's ability to address systemic auto safety issues.</ref>\n\n===Recall===\n\nThough Ford could have proceeded with the formal recall hearing, fearing additional damage to the company's public reputation the company agreed to a \"voluntary recall\" program.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: Ford could have refused to recall and have chosen instead to defend the Pinto's design in the formal recall hearings at NHTSA.\" While this tactic could easily have delayed any forced recall for months, if not for more than a year, the cost of the publicized hearings to Ford's reputation could have been substantial, even if Ford had been successful in the end. Ford agreed to \"voluntarily recall\" the Pinto in June 1978.</ref> On June 9, 1978, days before the NHTSA was to issue Ford a formal recall order, Ford recalled 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest recall in automotive history at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: the Pinto was the subject of the largest recall in automobile history at the time.</ref> Ford disagreed with the NHTSA finding of defect, and said the recall was to \"end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: In a prepared statement, Ford vice President Herbet L. Misch said: \"Ford informed NHTSA that it does not agree with the agency's initial determination of May 8 that an unreasonable risk of safety is involved in the design of these cars&nbsp;...\" Misch said Ford decided to offer the modifications \"so as to end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles\".</ref> The Ford recall placed a polyethylene shield between the tank and likely causes of puncture, lengthened the filler tube, and improved the tank filler seal in the event of collision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/1975/FORD/PINTO|title=1975 FORD PINTO|website=NHTSA}}</ref>\n\n=== Legal cases ===\nApproximately 117 lawsuits were brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto.<ref>{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003}}: Ford customers filed 117 lawsuits, according to Peter Wyden in The Unknown Iacocca.</ref>  The two most significant cases were ''Grimshaw v.

Ford Motor Co.]]'', decided in February 1978, is one of two important Pinto cases.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}</ref>  A 1972 Pinto driven by Lily Gray stalled in the center lane of a California freeway.  The car was struck from behind by a vehicle initially traveling at 50&nbsp;mph and impacted at an estimated between 30 and 50&nbsp;mph, resulting in a fuel tank fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:The Pinto was then struck by a car, which had originally been traveling at about fifty miles per hour but which had braked down to a speed of perhaps thirty miles per hour at the point of impact.9 ... [footnote 9]For reasons quite beyond the court's control, its opinion must be treated cautiously as a source of actual facts. Because the defendant was appealing a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the court was under an obligation to view all the evidence in a way most favorable to the plaintiffs and essentially to ignore evidence in the record that might be favorable to the defendant. See id. at 773, 820, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 359, 388.  In fact, Ford's basic position at trial-which the court's opinion at no point mentions was that the approaching car (a Ford Galaxie) had not slowed down at all, and had struck the Gray car at a speed in excess of 50 miles per hour. There was an enormous amount of evidence at trial supporting each of the parties' factual claims as to the\nGalaxie's closing speed. Had the jury accepted Ford's speed estimate, there would not have been much of an issue of crashworthiness: for the plaintiffs' position throughout trial was that even a state-of-the-art fuel system could not maintain integrity in a 50 mile-per hour collision.</ref>  Gray died at the time of the impact.  The passenger, Richard Grimshaw, was seriously burned.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: pg 208</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:pg 1016</ref> The plaintiff's bar collaborated with ''Mother Jones'' and The Center for Auto Safety to publicize damning information about Ford prior to trial.<ref name=\"Frank\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:\nBased on information given to it by lawyers preparing cases against Ford, the Center for Auto Safety petitioned NHTSA in the mid-1970s to investigate the Pinto's rear-end design.

The fact that these costs would also have been incurred for thousands of consumers who were not injured will not loom as large, as Judge Easterbrook emphasized. Thus, there is a tendency to exhibit \"hindsight bias\" rather than to consider the expected costs and expected benefits at the time of the safety decision.|jstor=1229473|hdl=1803/6556}}</ref>  The case is also cited as an example of irrational punitive damage awards.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Viscusi|first1=W.

The punitive damage award in the Ford Pinto case is, however, much more difficult to justify. To a large extent it rested on the premise that Ford had behaved reprehensibly when it balanced safety against cost in designing the Pinto. However, the process by which manufacturers render such trade-off design decisions seems not only to be anticipated but endorsed by the prevailing risk-benefit standard for design liability. Accordingly, the Pinto jury's decision that punitive damages were appropriate-a decision that was affirmed by the trial judge and the court of appeal-raises serious questions about the operational viability of the risk-benefit standard itself.</ref>\n\n==== ''Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.'' ====\n\nOn August 10, 1978, three teenage girls of the Urlich family of [[Osceola, Indiana]], were killed when the 1973 Pinto they were in was involved in a rear-end collision. The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left on the top of the car and subsequently fell onto the road. While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van.<ref>{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}</ref>  Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. ''Indiana v. Ford'' was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with homicide.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:There is little doubt about the importance of State of Indiana v. Ford Motor Company from a legal standpoint. This case was the first time criminal charges were bought against an American corporation for faulty product design. According to attorney Malcolm Wheeler (1981, p. 250), \"[n]ewspapers referred to it as the most important economic case of the century&nbsp;...\" The notion that a corporation could be held accountable for its criminal actions was a novel legal concept at the time. Wheeler was not alone in his estimation of the case as influential. Because of the application of criminal law to corporate behavior, others have referred to this litigation as \"unprecedented\" (Welty, 1982) and as a \"landmark case\" (Clinard, 1990; Frank & Lynch, 1992; Hills, 1987; Maakestad, 1987). Maakestad (1987, p. 7) stated that the case \"[r]eestablished an important precedent: In certain cases involving human health and safety, corporations and their executives could be required to submit not only to the scrutiny and sanctions of traditional federal regulatory agencies, but to state criminal courts as well.\"</ref> If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute.<ref name=csm19800314>{{cite news |title=Pinto verdict lets US industry off hook |first=Charles E. |last=Dole |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=March 14, 1980 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0314/031435.html |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |quote=An Indiana farm country jury in the 10-week landmark trial found Ford \"not guilty\" in the deaths of three teen-age girls whose 1973-model Pinto exploded when a speeding van struck it in the rear Aug. 10, 1978.}}</ref>  Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1978-half a year after the verdict in the tort case-a 1973 Pinto was involved in a fatal crash in Ulrich, Indiana. Indiana public officials decided to prosecute Ford for the crime of reckless homicide. Because the reckless homicide statute had been enacted only in 1977, Ford could not be prosecuted for the reckless design of the Pinto; rather, the prosecution needed to show a reckless post-1977 failure by Ford to repair or warn. Largely because of the narrowness of the resulting issue, at trial the prosecution was not able to secure the admission of internal Ford documents on which it had hoped to build its case. Ford's defense effort in this criminal case was vastly more ambitious than the effort the company had previously mounted in defending itself against Grimshaw's tort claim. In March 1980 the Indiana jury found Ford not guilty. The jury seemed ambivalent about the Pinto, but concluded that Ford had avoided recklessness in the conduct of its recall program.</ref>  The effort was led by [[James F. Neal]] with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the [[Elkhart County]] Prosecuting Attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 4, 1980 |volume=13 |number=5 |title=A Local D.A.

One viewpoint was stated by thenpresident of the National District Attorneys Association, Robert Johnson, Sr. He is quoted as saying \"We'll see more prosecutions like this&nbsp;... A psychological barrier has been broken, and the big corporations are now vulnerable\" (Bodine, 1980, p. 3). The popular idea was that corporate malfeasance would be curtailed if corporations were held accountable for their actions. Thus, the feeling among some legal commentators was that the Pinto case represented a fundamental shift in how the criminal courts would perceive corporations.&nbsp;... Another perspective was that the case was completely frivolous. Commenting on civil litigation, Harry Philo, then president-elect of the Association of American Trial Lawyers of America, commented that \"In my opinion, the Pinto case was a completely irrelevant prosecution\" (Stuart, 1980, p.4). However, he also stated that \"[t]he verdict won't deter civil lawsuits\" (Mleczko, 1980, llA).</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}:The important point here is that neither the drama of the case nor its outcome should be allowed to obscure the essential legal and institutional issues. On the record, this criminal prosecution should never have been brought at all.</ref>  In 2002, Malcolm Wheeler, a lawyer working with the Ford defense team, noted that the case was a poor application of criminal law.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:The very fact that there has not been another product liability criminal prosecution since that case tells you one major impact of the case was&nbsp;... [that] it said the criminal law is a very, very poor tool to use for product litigation.  It's just not appropriate</ref> The case also impacted how Ford handled future product liability cases both legally and in the press.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:Paul Weaver worked for the Ford Motor Company from 1978 to 1980 in the corporation's public affairs staff preparing company positions on public policy issues. He criticized Ford for how it dealt with the controversy surrounding the Pinto. According to Weaver (1988, p.94), \"[t]he design of its [Pinto's] fuel system was essentially the same as that of other cars of its size and generation\" and \"Pintos had about the same rate of death from fire due to rear-end collision as other small cars.\" His assertion is that the Pinto was not unusual compared to similar models. Weaver admits that \"[w]e should simply have told the truth about the car\" and \"[w]e did not fight to vindicate ourselves.\" Thus, by refusing to mount a major publicity campaign, Ford gave the impression that it was guilty.&nbsp;... These remarks add an interesting dimension to the Pinto case in that one of the clear lessons was to confront issues raised about defective products. This concern illustrates that after the Pinto case, corporations became much more willing and adept at handling images stemming from poor design. In other words, the Pinto case made corporations much more willing to wage public relations battles over design and production flaws.</ref>\n\n===Subsequent analysis===\nThe recall was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 2009 top ten product recalls, ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine's 2010 five most notorious recalls of all time, and [[NBC News]]' 2013 twelve famous recalls.<ref name=nbc20130618>{{cite news |agency=[[NBC News]] |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/18/19024405-take-that-back-famous-recalls-from-tylenol-to-toyota |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |first=Gillian |last=Spear |title=Take that back: Famous recalls, from Tylenol to Toyota |quote=Three people died before the recall and six died in Pinto fires during the time following the recall but before the parts to repair the vehicle were made available.}}</ref><ref name=time20090702>{{cite news |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Top 10 Product Recalls |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1908719_1908717_1908696,00.html |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |title=5 Most Notorious Recalls of All Time |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g261/4345725/?slide=2 |first=John Pearley |last=Huffman |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref> ''Time'' said \"The Ford Pinto was a famously bad automobile, but worse still might be Ford's handling of the safety concerns.\"<ref name=time20090702/>\nAccording to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2010, the award \"signaled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects.\"<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\nUCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz, in a ''[[Rutgers Law Review]]'' article (see ''Section 7.3 NHTSA Investigation'' above), studied the fatality rates of the Pinto and several other small cars of the time period.  He noted that fires, and rear-end fires in particular, are very small portion of overall auto fatalities.  At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes are the result of rear-end collisions.<ref name=\"Schwartz 1991\">{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} Footnote pg 1029</ref>  When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, Schwartz notes that subcompact cars as a class have a generally higher fatality risk.  Pintos represented 1.9% of all cars on the road in the 1975\u201376 period.  During that time the car represented 1.9% of all \"fatal accidents accompanied by some fire.\" Implying the car was average for all cars and slightly above average for its class.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1031</ref>  When all types of fatalities are considered, the Pinto was approximately even with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Datsun 510.

This was considered respectable for a subcompact car.  Only when considering the narrow subset of rear-impact, fire fatalities for the car were somewhat worse than the average for subcompact cars.  While acknowledging this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejects the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1033</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[60 Minutes#Unintended acceleration|''60 Minutes'': \"Unintended acceleration\"]]\n* [[AVE Mizar]] \u2013 a flying Pinto\n* [[Dateline NBC#General Motors vs. NBC|''Dateline NBC'': \"General Motors v.

The smallest American Ford vehicle since 1907, the Pinto was the first subcompact vehicle produced by Ford in North America.\n\nThe Pinto was marketed in three body styles through its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon.  [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the '''Mercury Bobcat''' from 1975 to 1980 (1974\u20131980 in Canada<ref>Mays, James C. ''Ford and Canada: 100 Years Together'' (Montr\u00e9al: Syam Publishing, 2003). p.116.</ref>). From 1974 to 1978, the [[Ford Mustang (second generation)|Ford Mustang II]] shared a common platform with the Pinto and Bobcat, though with a different unibody and powertrain assortment.  For the 1981 model year, the Pinto was replaced by the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], as Ford moved its product line towards front-wheel drive. Over 3 million Pintos were produced over its 10-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevy Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at [[Edison Assembly]] (Edison, New Jersey), [[St. Thomas Assembly]] (Southwold, Ontario), and [[San Jose Assembly Plant|San Jose Assembly]] (Milpitas, California).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/25/HOG2UHS4701.DTL|title=Lofty ambition / Developer revs up former Ford factory in Richmond for real live-work spaces|last=Smith|first=Charles|date=March 25, 2006|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>  \n\nSince the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has been surrounded by controversy.  Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires related to the tanks rupturing in rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars.  The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as a [[business ethics]] as well as [[tort reform]] case study.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Gremlin-Pinto-Vega in 2010.JPG|thumb|left|First-generation American subcompacts, left to right: AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto, Chevrolet Vega]]\n\nAmerican automakers had first countered imports such as the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with vehicles [[compact car]]s including the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]], although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class.

Ford was accused of knowing the car had an unsafe tank placement then forgoing design changes based on an internal cost-benefit analysis.  Two landmark legal cases, ''[[Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.]]'' and ''[[Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', resulted from fatal accidents involving Pintos.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Conventional wisdom holds that Ford Motor Company decided to rush the Pinto into production in 1970 to compete with compact foreign imports, despite internal pre-production tests that showed gas tank ruptures in low-speed rear-end collisions would produce deadly fires.  This decision purportedly derived from an infamous seven-page cost-benefit analysis (the \"Grush/Saunby Report\" [1973]) that valued human lives at $200,000.  Settling burn victims' lawsuits would have cost $49.5 million, far less than the $137 million needed to make minor corrections.  According to this account, the company made an informed, cynical, and impressively coordinated decision that \"payouts\" (Kelman and Hamilton 1989:311) to families of burn victims were more cost-effective than improving fuel tank integrity.  This description provides the unambiguous foundation on which the media and academics have built a Pinto gas tank decision-making narrative.</ref>\n\nScholarly work published in the decades after the Pinto's release have examined the cases and offered summations of the general understanding of the Pinto and the controversy regarding the car's safety performance and risk of fire.

The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]], initially only considered front impacts.  In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions.  The proposed standard was based on a 20&nbsp;mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20&nbsp;mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard.<ref name=Rossow>{{cite news |last1=Rossow |first1=Mark |title=Ethics: An Alternative Account of the Ford Pinto Case|publisher=Continuing Education and Development Inc. |date=2015 |quote='Fixed-barrier' meant that the vehicle was moving (towed backwards) into a stationary barrier&nbsp;... The 20-mph fixed barrier standard was greeted with uniform opposition from the auto industry because it was a much more severe test than the moving-barrier standard.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: pg 36, 43</ref>  Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30&nbsp;mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20&nbsp;mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: In the design stage (1967\u20131970), no company or government standard on rear-end fuel tank integrity existed to guide the engineers, but their actions were consistent with the taken for granted, industry-wide tradition of building lower levels of [[crashworthiness]] into small cars. This situation changed in the marketing stage (post 1970). Shortly after the 1971 model year Pintos were released, Ford adopted an internal20 mile-per-hour moving barrier standard for the 1973 model year-the only manufacturer to do so (Gioia 1996; Strobel 1994). The extant legal/regulatory environment reinforced engineers' beliefs that this standard was quite reasonable\" since it was the \"same one recommended at that time by the federal General Services Administration; the Canadian equivalent of the GSA; the Society of Automotive Engineers; and a private consulting firm hired by NHTSA&nbsp;...\" and by NHTSA itself in 1969 (Strobel 1980:205). This standard would constrain future debates by certifying the Pinto as safe\" to Ford's subunit charged with evaluating potential recallable safety problems.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1970, 1971 model-year Pintos began coming off the assembly line. Just a few days later, NHTSA-which had never acted on its earlier proposal-advanced a more demanding set of proposed regulations. Three months later, Ford officials decided that for purposes of the 1973 model year, Ford would adopt, as its own internal objective, the regulations that NHTSA had suggested in 1969. In order to respond to NHTSA's more recent proposal, Ford engineers, with actual Pintos now available, stepped up the crash-testing process, and identified a. number of design modifications that might imp:rove the Pinto's performance. In October 1971, Ford officials decided against incorporating any of these modifications into current Pintos; rather, it would wait until NHTSA clarified its position. In 1973, NHTSA promulgated its fuel-tank standard but ruled that this standard would apply only to 1977 models.  Ford adopted a 20&nbsp;mph moving-barrier standard for all 1973 cars.</ref>  Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.<ref>{{harvnb|Strobel|1979}}: Ford then joined other automakers in an aggressive lobbying campaign that was successful in delaying and softening proposed federal standards on how strong fuel systems must be to resist rupture an potential explosion.</ref>\n\nThe Pinto's design positioned its fuel tank between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: The tank was positioned between the rear bumper and the rear axle (a standard industry practice for the time).</ref> The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and fire in a rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear \"crush space\", a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an \"essentially ornamental\" rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers).<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:Page 1015 and Footnote 9, \"The court of appeal opinion referred to the Pinto's bumper as the flimsiest of any American car.

Telephone interview with Mark Robinson, Jr. (Sept. 12, 1990) [hereinafter Robinson Interview). In the later criminal case, however, Byron Bloch, a prosecution witness, stated in cross-examination that the Pinto's bumper was about the same as those of the Gremlin, Vega, and Dodge Colt. See L. STROBEL, supra note 5, at 157 (\"I would say they were all bad.\").\"</ref>  Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, as part of a response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds.  Design changes were made, but post-launch tests showed similar results.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: A few months later Ford began crash-testing modified Mavericks in part to prepare a response to NHTSA's proposed regulations.  The results demonstrated vulnerability of fuel-integrity at fairly low speeds and some modifications were made. In August of 1970, the first model year Pinto, the 1971, went into production. Post-production testing revealed similar results. Still, there were no federal performance standards at the time and the proposed regulations addressed only front-end collisions.</ref> These tests were conducted to develop crash testing standards rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity.  Though Ford engineers were not pleased with the car's performance, no reports of the time indicate particular concern.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: engineers in the design stage were still trying \"to find out how to conduct crash tests\" (Feaheny 1997; see also Lacey 1986:613). For example, an internal Pinto test report dated November, 1970 listed as its objective \"To develop a test procedure to be used to provide baseline data on vehicle fuel system integrity\" (NHTSA C7-38-Al.5, Final Test Report #T-0738). In this test, a Pinto sedan exhibited \"excessive fuel tank leakage\" when towed rearward into a fixed barrier at 21.5 miles per hour, considered roughly equivalent to a car-to-car impact at 35 miles per hour.  Nothing in this, or any other, Ford test report indicates that participants felt cause for concern or organizational action. Although some Ford engineers were not especially pleased, they felt that the data were inconclusive or the risks acceptable (Feaheny 1997; Strobel 1980), or they kept their concerns to themselves (Camps 1997). Some felt that cars would rarely be subjected to the extreme forces generated in a fixed-barrier test in real-world collisions (Feaheny 1997; Devine 1996). NHTSA apparently agreed and ultimately replaced the proposed fixedbarrier test with a less-stringent moving-barrier test in its final standard (U.S. Department of Transportation 1988)</ref>\nFord also tested several different vehicle modifications which could improve rear impact performance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: Ford had in fact crash-tested 11 vehicles; 8 of these cars suffered potentially catastrophic gas tank ruptures. The only 3 cars that survived intact had each been modified in some way to protect the tank.</ref> However, the engineer's occupational caution and aversion to \"unproven\" solutions as well as a view that the crash test results were inconclusive resulted in the use of a conventional fuel tank design and placement.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Occupational caution encouraged engineers to view many design adjustments that improved test performance as \"unproven\" in real-world accidents (Devine 1996; Feaheny 1997; Schwartz 1991; Strickland 1996; Strobel 1980). Engineers, who typically value \"uncertainty avoidance\" (Allison 1971:72 ), chose to stick with an existing design rather than face uncertainties associated with novel ones (Devine 1996; Strobel 1980). One series of tests, for instance, showed that Pintos equipped with pliable foam-like gas tanks would not leak in 30 mile-per-hour crashes. But some engineers feared that such a tank might melt and disagreed with others who felt it was safer than the existing metal design (Devine 1996, see also Strobel\n1980). Other engineers believed that rubber bladders improved performance in tests, but anticipated problems under real-world conditions (Strobel 1980).</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a \"tank within the tank\"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970s, but also rebuttal testimony that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility.</ref>  The use of an above-the-axle tank location was considered safer by some, but not all, at Ford.  This placement was not a viable option for the hatchback and station wagon body styles.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Ford whistle-blower Harley Copp's argument-that the Pinto would have been safer had its\ngas tank been placed above the axle rather than behind it-is often cited in Pinto narratives as an example of safety being sacrificed to profits, or at least trunk space, in the design stage (Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987; Dowie 1977; Strobel1994). Yet Copp did not reach this conclusion until 1977 (Strobel1980). And other engineers were considerably less certain about it, even though the above-the-axle design did perform better in one set of crash tests. The engineer overseeing the Pinto's design, Harold MacDonald (whose father died in a fuel tank fire when his Model A Ford exploded after a frontal collision with a tree), felt that the above-the axle placement was less safe under real-world conditions because the tank was closer to the passenger compartment and more likely to be punctured by items in the trunk (Strobel1980).</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1973, field reports of Ford Pintos consumed by fire after low-speed rear-end collisions were received by Ford's recall coordinator office.<ref>{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: I began to construct my own files of incoming safety problems. One of these new files concerned reports of Pintos \"lighting up\"  (in the words of a field representative) in rear-end accidents. There were actually very few reports, perhaps because component failure was not initially assumed. These cars simply were consumed by fire after apparently very low speed accidents.</ref>  Based on standard procedures used to evaluate field reports, Ford's internal recall evaluation group twice reviewed the field data and found no actionable issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: When Gioia became Recall Coordinator, he inherited about 100 active recall campaigns, half of them safety-related. As with most jobs, the enormous workload required him to use standard operating procedures\" (SOPs) to organize and manage information for decision making (d. Kriesberg 1976:1102). SOPs increase organizational efficiency by operating as cognitive scripts that transform decision-making opportunities into largely predetermined action patterns. Existing SOPs required that, to be \"recallable,\" problems needed either high frequency or a directly traceable causal link to a design defect. When reports began to trickle in to Gioia that Pintos were \"lighting up\" in relatively low speed accidents, and after viewing the burned wreckage of a Pinto, he initiated a meeting to determine if this represented a recallable problem. His work group voted unanimously not to recall the Pinto because the weak data did not meet SOP criteria (Gioia 1996). The work group was unaware of any cost-benefit analyses or Pinto crash test results. Reports of Pinto fires continued to trickle in, and eventually Gioia did become aware of, and concerned about, the crash test results. Again he wondered if the Pinto had a recallable problem, so he initiated a second meeting to convince his co-workers that crash tests showed a possible design flaw. But others again saw no design flaws\u2014after all, the Pinto met internal company standards, and no contradictory external standard existed. The work group conceived the tank leak \"problem\" not as a defect, but as a fundamental and unalterable design feature: the car's small size, the use of light metals, and unibody construction produced a tendency for Pintos (and others in its class) to \"crush up like an accordion\" in rear-end collisions (Gioia 1996).</ref>\n\n=== Cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Pinto Memo ===\n\nIn 1973, Ford's Environmental and Safety Engineering division developed a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] entitled ''Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires'' for submission to the NHTSA in support of Ford's objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation.<ref name=PintoMemo>{{cite report |title=Fatalities Associated With Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires |first1=E.S. |last1=Grush |first2=C.S. |last2=Saundy |publisher=Ford Environmental and Safety Engineering |url=http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/import/phpq3mJ7F_FordMemo.pdf |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> The document became known as the \"Pinto Memo\".

The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: In calculating the benefits, the analysis used a figure of $200,000 per life.  NHTSA had developed this figure in 1972.</ref>  In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million.  The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a benefit to society of $49.5 million.\n\nIn August 1977, having been provided with a copy of the memo by ''[[Grimshaw v.

A large \"bullet car\" was used instead of a standard moving barrier. Weights were placed in the nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable [[Stoddard solvent|Stoddard fluid]] as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview, the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35&nbsp;mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed. \"Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: NHTSA engineer Lee Strickland was assigned to determine if Pinto (and Chevrolet Vega) tank problems warranted a mandatory recall. Strickland's work group held the Pinto and Vega to a higher standard than other cars (Strickland 1996). It dispensed with the usual moving barrier. Instead, it intentionally selected a large and particularly rigid \"bullet car\" to hit the Pinto's rear end. It weighed down the bullet car's nose to slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. It also turned on the bullet car's headlights to provide a ready source of ignition. And it completely filled gas tanks in both cars with gasoline rather than the non-flammable Stoddard fluid normally used. Strickland justified these actions as approximating real-world worst-case circumstances (Davidson 1983; NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). For NHTSA, the tests seemed an unqualified success: two 1972 Pintos burst into flame upon impact. In the summer of 1978 NHTSA announced that the Pinto gas tank represented a safety defect, leading to the largest recall campaign in automobile history at that time (NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). Ford agreed to \"voluntarily\" recall 1971\u20131976 Pintos. Other small cars sold during the 19 70s were not recalled, even though most were comparable, or in the case of the AMC Gremlin probably less safe (Schwartz 1991; NHTSA C7-38; Swigert and Farrell 198081:180). Their manufacturers successfully defended them as acceptable risks (see Wallace 1978). When we asked why NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing the 35 mile-per-hour test, although most small cars could not withstand such a test, Strickland ( 1996) analogized that, \"Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too.\"</ref><ref name=\"Lee1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Matthew T|title=The Ford Pinto Case and the Development of Auto Safety Regulations, 1893\u20141978|journal=Business and Economic History|date=1998|volume=27|issue=2|pages=390\u2013401}}</ref>\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ultimately directed Ford to recall the Pinto. Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. The NHTSA investigation found that 27 deaths were found to have occurred between 1970 and mid-1977 in rear-impact crashes that resulted in fire.  The NHTSA did not indicate if these impacts would have been survivable absent fire or if the impacts were more severe than even a state of the art (for 1977) fuel system could have withstood.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: Relying on a variety of external sources (including Ford), NHTSA indicated that it was aware of thirty-eight instances in which rear-end impact on Pintos had resulted in fuel-tank leakage or fire; these instances, in turn, resulted in twenty-seven deaths and twenty-four nonfatal burn injuries.66 The NHTSA report also incorporated the data internally provided by NHTSA's own Fatal Accident Reporting System (\"FARS\"), which had begun operation in 1975. FARS data showed that from January 1975 through the middle of 1977, seventeen people had died in accidents in which Pinto rear-end collisions resulted in fires. 67 In comparing NHTSA's figure of twenty-seven deaths for 1971\u201377 with the FARS figure of seventeen for 1975\u201377,68 one should keep in mind that the number of Pintos on the road was increasing every year in a cumulative way. The NHTSA figure of twenty-seven fatalities hence seems roughly in the ballpark by way of suggesting the number of people who had died in Pinto rear-end fires. In setting forth this number, however, NHTSA made no effort to estimate how many of these deaths were caused by the Pinto's specific design features. Many fire deaths undeniably result from high-speed collisions that would induce leakage even in state-of-the-art fuel systems;69 moreover, cars in the subcompact class generally entail a relatively high fatality risk.70 Yet the NHTSA report did not compare the performance results of the Pinto to the results of other cars then on the road, including other subcompacts.</ref>  In their analysis of the social factors affecting the NHTSA's actions, Lee and Ermann note that 27 is the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem which contributed to collisions after the affected cars stalled.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:Beginning in the late 1970s, claims consistent with \"Pinto Madness\" readily gained public acceptance, but credible contradictory claims did not (e.g., Davidson 1983; Epstein 1980). For instance, Dowie's \"conservative\" estimate of 500 deaths (1977:18) was accepted, while NHTSA's report that it could document only 27 Pinto fire-related deaths (NHTSA C7-38; Frank 1985) was ignored. A transmission problem that also caused 27 Pinto deaths (and 180 on other Ford products [Clarke 1988]) never became a social problem. Similarly, publics accepted claims of safety errors leveled by Harley Copp, a Ford engineer who was apparently overseas when early crucial decisions were made (Camps 1997; Strobel 1980), but ignored other safety-conscious Pinto engineers who believed windshield retention was a more important safety problem (Camps 1997), and lack of safety glass caused more deaths (Feaheny 1997).</ref>  They also note that the NHTSA had two primary incentives in proving a defect existed in the Pinto's fuel system design.  The administration was pressured by safety advocates (Center for Auto Safety) as well as the public response.  It was also being forced into action due to the ways in which both the courts and executive branch were limiting the ability of the NHTSA to address systematic auto safety issues.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: By the time of its Pinto investigation, NHTSA had essentially abandoned its original mission of forcing industry-wide safety improvements, in favor of investigating and recalling specific cars (Mashaw and Harfst 1990). NHTSA had two primary incentives in reinforcing the extant Nfocal organization\" imagery of the Pinto narrative. First, NHTSA was pressured by specific organizations in its network (e.g., the Center for Auto Safety) and members of the public (see NHTSA C7-38) to take action on the Pinto's gas tank. Second, other network actors (e.g., courts, the Nixon administration, the auto industry) had increasingly limited NHTSA's ability to address systemic auto safety issues.</ref>\n\n===Recall===\n\nThough Ford could have proceeded with the formal recall hearing, fearing additional damage to the company's public reputation the company agreed to a \"voluntary recall\" program.<ref>{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: Ford could have refused to recall and have chosen instead to defend the Pinto's design in the formal recall hearings at NHTSA.\" While this tactic could easily have delayed any forced recall for months, if not for more than a year, the cost of the publicized hearings to Ford's reputation could have been substantial, even if Ford had been successful in the end. Ford agreed to \"voluntarily recall\" the Pinto in June 1978.</ref> On June 9, 1978, days before the NHTSA was to issue Ford a formal recall order, Ford recalled 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest recall in automotive history at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: the Pinto was the subject of the largest recall in automobile history at the time.</ref> Ford disagreed with the NHTSA finding of defect, and said the recall was to \"end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: In a prepared statement, Ford vice President Herbet L. Misch said: \"Ford informed NHTSA that it does not agree with the agency's initial determination of May 8 that an unreasonable risk of safety is involved in the design of these cars&nbsp;...\" Misch said Ford decided to offer the modifications \"so as to end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles\".</ref> The Ford recall placed a polyethylene shield between the tank and likely causes of puncture, lengthened the filler tube, and improved the tank filler seal in the event of collision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/1975/FORD/PINTO|title=1975 FORD PINTO|website=NHTSA}}</ref>\n\n=== Legal cases ===\nApproximately 117 lawsuits were brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto.<ref>{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003}}: Ford customers filed 117 lawsuits, according to Peter Wyden in The Unknown Iacocca.</ref>  The two most significant cases were ''Grimshaw v.

The car was struck from behind by a vehicle initially traveling at 50&nbsp;mph and impacted at an estimated between 30 and 50&nbsp;mph, resulting in a fuel tank fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:The Pinto was then struck by a car, which had originally been traveling at about fifty miles per hour but which had braked down to a speed of perhaps thirty miles per hour at the point of impact.9 ... [footnote 9]For reasons quite beyond the court's control, its opinion must be treated cautiously as a source of actual facts. Because the defendant was appealing a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the court was under an obligation to view all the evidence in a way most favorable to the plaintiffs and essentially to ignore evidence in the record that might be favorable to the defendant. See id. at 773, 820, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 359, 388.  In fact, Ford's basic position at trial-which the court's opinion at no point mentions was that the approaching car (a Ford Galaxie) had not slowed down at all, and had struck the Gray car at a speed in excess of 50 miles per hour. There was an enormous amount of evidence at trial supporting each of the parties' factual claims as to the\nGalaxie's closing speed. Had the jury accepted Ford's speed estimate, there would not have been much of an issue of crashworthiness: for the plaintiffs' position throughout trial was that even a state-of-the-art fuel system could not maintain integrity in a 50 mile-per hour collision.</ref>  Gray died at the time of the impact.

Jurors have a tendency to compare the often very small per-unit safety cost with the costs borne by the injured victim. Rather than examine the entire market and the associated benefits and costs, jurors will be offended by, or will not fully understand, a comprehensive risk-analysis approach and will focus their assessment more narrowly on the identified victim and the costs of preventing that injury. The fact that these costs would also have been incurred for thousands of consumers who were not injured will not loom as large, as Judge Easterbrook emphasized. Thus, there is a tendency to exhibit \"hindsight bias\" rather than to consider the expected costs and expected benefits at the time of the safety decision.|jstor=1229473|hdl=1803/6556}}</ref>  The case is also cited as an example of irrational punitive damage awards.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Viscusi|first1=W.

The punitive damage award in the Ford Pinto case is, however, much more difficult to justify. To a large extent it rested on the premise that Ford had behaved reprehensibly when it balanced safety against cost in designing the Pinto. However, the process by which manufacturers render such trade-off design decisions seems not only to be anticipated but endorsed by the prevailing risk-benefit standard for design liability. Accordingly, the Pinto jury's decision that punitive damages were appropriate-a decision that was affirmed by the trial judge and the court of appeal-raises serious questions about the operational viability of the risk-benefit standard itself.</ref>\n\n==== ''Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.'' ====\n\nOn August 10, 1978, three teenage girls of the Urlich family of [[Osceola, Indiana]], were killed when the 1973 Pinto they were in was involved in a rear-end collision. The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left on the top of the car and subsequently fell onto the road. While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van.<ref>{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}</ref>  Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. ''Indiana v. Ford'' was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with homicide.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:There is little doubt about the importance of State of Indiana v. Ford Motor Company from a legal standpoint. This case was the first time criminal charges were bought against an American corporation for faulty product design. According to attorney Malcolm Wheeler (1981, p. 250), \"[n]ewspapers referred to it as the most important economic case of the century&nbsp;...\" The notion that a corporation could be held accountable for its criminal actions was a novel legal concept at the time. Wheeler was not alone in his estimation of the case as influential. Because of the application of criminal law to corporate behavior, others have referred to this litigation as \"unprecedented\" (Welty, 1982) and as a \"landmark case\" (Clinard, 1990; Frank & Lynch, 1992; Hills, 1987; Maakestad, 1987). Maakestad (1987, p. 7) stated that the case \"[r]eestablished an important precedent: In certain cases involving human health and safety, corporations and their executives could be required to submit not only to the scrutiny and sanctions of traditional federal regulatory agencies, but to state criminal courts as well.\"</ref> If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute.<ref name=csm19800314>{{cite news |title=Pinto verdict lets US industry off hook |first=Charles E. |last=Dole |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=March 14, 1980 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0314/031435.html |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |quote=An Indiana farm country jury in the 10-week landmark trial found Ford \"not guilty\" in the deaths of three teen-age girls whose 1973-model Pinto exploded when a speeding van struck it in the rear Aug. 10, 1978.}}</ref>  Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1978-half a year after the verdict in the tort case-a 1973 Pinto was involved in a fatal crash in Ulrich, Indiana. Indiana public officials decided to prosecute Ford for the crime of reckless homicide. Because the reckless homicide statute had been enacted only in 1977, Ford could not be prosecuted for the reckless design of the Pinto; rather, the prosecution needed to show a reckless post-1977 failure by Ford to repair or warn. Largely because of the narrowness of the resulting issue, at trial the prosecution was not able to secure the admission of internal Ford documents on which it had hoped to build its case. Ford's defense effort in this criminal case was vastly more ambitious than the effort the company had previously mounted in defending itself against Grimshaw's tort claim. In March 1980 the Indiana jury found Ford not guilty. The jury seemed ambivalent about the Pinto, but concluded that Ford had avoided recklessness in the conduct of its recall program.</ref>  The effort was led by [[James F. Neal]] with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the [[Elkhart County]] Prosecuting Attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 4, 1980 |volume=13 |number=5 |title=A Local D.A.

One viewpoint was stated by thenpresident of the National District Attorneys Association, Robert Johnson, Sr. He is quoted as saying \"We'll see more prosecutions like this&nbsp;... A psychological barrier has been broken, and the big corporations are now vulnerable\" (Bodine, 1980, p. 3). The popular idea was that corporate malfeasance would be curtailed if corporations were held accountable for their actions. Thus, the feeling among some legal commentators was that the Pinto case represented a fundamental shift in how the criminal courts would perceive corporations.&nbsp;... Another perspective was that the case was completely frivolous. Commenting on civil litigation, Harry Philo, then president-elect of the Association of American Trial Lawyers of America, commented that \"In my opinion, the Pinto case was a completely irrelevant prosecution\" (Stuart, 1980, p.4). However, he also stated that \"[t]he verdict won't deter civil lawsuits\" (Mleczko, 1980, llA).</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}:The important point here is that neither the drama of the case nor its outcome should be allowed to obscure the essential legal and institutional issues. On the record, this criminal prosecution should never have been brought at all.</ref>  In 2002, Malcolm Wheeler, a lawyer working with the Ford defense team, noted that the case was a poor application of criminal law.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:The very fact that there has not been another product liability criminal prosecution since that case tells you one major impact of the case was&nbsp;... [that] it said the criminal law is a very, very poor tool to use for product litigation.  It's just not appropriate</ref> The case also impacted how Ford handled future product liability cases both legally and in the press.<ref>{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:Paul Weaver worked for the Ford Motor Company from 1978 to 1980 in the corporation's public affairs staff preparing company positions on public policy issues. He criticized Ford for how it dealt with the controversy surrounding the Pinto. According to Weaver (1988, p.94), \"[t]he design of its [Pinto's] fuel system was essentially the same as that of other cars of its size and generation\" and \"Pintos had about the same rate of death from fire due to rear-end collision as other small cars.\" His assertion is that the Pinto was not unusual compared to similar models. Weaver admits that \"[w]e should simply have told the truth about the car\" and \"[w]e did not fight to vindicate ourselves.\" Thus, by refusing to mount a major publicity campaign, Ford gave the impression that it was guilty.&nbsp;... These remarks add an interesting dimension to the Pinto case in that one of the clear lessons was to confront issues raised about defective products. This concern illustrates that after the Pinto case, corporations became much more willing and adept at handling images stemming from poor design. In other words, the Pinto case made corporations much more willing to wage public relations battles over design and production flaws.</ref>\n\n===Subsequent analysis===\nThe recall was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 2009 top ten product recalls, ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine's 2010 five most notorious recalls of all time, and [[NBC News]]' 2013 twelve famous recalls.<ref name=nbc20130618>{{cite news |agency=[[NBC News]] |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/18/19024405-take-that-back-famous-recalls-from-tylenol-to-toyota |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |first=Gillian |last=Spear |title=Take that back: Famous recalls, from Tylenol to Toyota |quote=Three people died before the recall and six died in Pinto fires during the time following the recall but before the parts to repair the vehicle were made available.}}</ref><ref name=time20090702>{{cite news |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Top 10 Product Recalls |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1908719_1908717_1908696,00.html |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |title=5 Most Notorious Recalls of All Time |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g261/4345725/?slide=2 |first=John Pearley |last=Huffman |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref> ''Time'' said \"The Ford Pinto was a famously bad automobile, but worse still might be Ford's handling of the safety concerns.\"<ref name=time20090702/>\nAccording to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2010, the award \"signaled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects.\"<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\nUCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz, in a ''[[Rutgers Law Review]]'' article (see ''Section 7.3 NHTSA Investigation'' above), studied the fatality rates of the Pinto and several other small cars of the time period.  He noted that fires, and rear-end fires in particular, are very small portion of overall auto fatalities.  At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes are the result of rear-end collisions.<ref name=\"Schwartz 1991\">{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} Footnote pg 1029</ref>  When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, Schwartz notes that subcompact cars as a class have a generally higher fatality risk.  Pintos represented 1.9% of all cars on the road in the 1975\u201376 period.  During that time the car represented 1.9% of all \"fatal accidents accompanied by some fire.\" Implying the car was average for all cars and slightly above average for its class.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1031</ref>  When all types of fatalities are considered, the Pinto was approximately even with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Datsun 510.  It was significantly better than the Datsun 1200/210, Toyota Corolla and VW Beetle.<ref name=\"Schwartz 1991\"/>  The safety record of the car in terms of fire was average or slightly below average for compacts, and all cars respectively.  This was considered respectable for a subcompact car.  Only when considering the narrow subset of rear-impact, fire fatalities for the car were somewhat worse than the average for subcompact cars.  While acknowledging this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejects the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1033</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[60 Minutes#Unintended acceleration|''60 Minutes'': \"Unintended acceleration\"]]\n* [[AVE Mizar]] \u2013 a flying Pinto\n* [[Dateline NBC#General Motors vs. NBC|''Dateline NBC'': \"General Motors v.
