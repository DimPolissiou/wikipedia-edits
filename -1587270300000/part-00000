{"title_page": "Mid-range", "text_new": "{{For|loudspeakers|mid-range speaker}}\nIn [[statistics]], the '''mid-range''' or '''mid-extreme''' of a set of statistical data values is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the maximum and minimum values in a [[data set]], defined as:{{sfn|Dodge|2003}}\n\n:<math>M=\\frac{\\max x + \\min x}{2}.</math>\n\nThe mid-range is the midpoint of the [[Range (statistics)|range]]; as such, it is a measure of [[central tendency]].\n\nThe mid-range is rarely used in practical statistical analysis, as it lacks [[#Efficiency|efficiency]] as an estimator for most distributions of interest,  because it ignores all intermediate points, and lacks [[#Robustness|robustness]], as outliers change it significantly. Indeed, it is one of the least efficient and least robust statistics. However, it finds some use in special cases: it is the maximally efficient estimator for the center of a uniform distribution, trimmed mid-ranges address robustness, and as an [[L-estimator]], it is simple to understand and compute.\n\n==Robustness==\n\nThe midrange is highly sensitive to outliers and ignores all but two data points. It is therefore a very non-[[robust statistic]], having a [[breakdown point]] of 0, meaning that a single observation can change it arbitrarily. Further, it is highly influenced by outliers: increasing the sample maximum or decreasing the sample minimum by ''x'' changes the mid-range by <math>x/2,</math> while it changes the sample mean, which also has breakdown point of 0, by only <math>x/n.</math> It is thus of little use in practical statistics, unless outliers are already handled.\n\nA [[trimmed estimator|trimmed]] midrange is known as a '''{{visible anchor|midsummary}}''' \u2013 the ''n''% trimmed midrange is the average of the ''n''% and (100&minus;''n'')% percentiles, and is more robust, having a [[breakdown point]] of ''n''%. In the middle of these is the [[midhinge]], which is the 25% midsummary. The [[median]] can be interpreted as the fully trimmed (50%) mid-range; this accords with the convention that the median of an even number of points is the mean of the two middle points.\n\nThese trimmed midranges are also of interest as [[descriptive statistics]] or as [[L-estimator]]s of central location or [[skewness]]: differences of midsummaries, such as midhinge minus the median, give measures of skewness at different points in the tail.{{sfn|Velleman|Hoaglin|1981}}\n\n==Efficiency==\n\nDespite its drawbacks, in some cases it is useful: the midrange is a highly [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficient]] [[estimator]] of \u03bc, given a small sample of a sufficiently [[platykurtic]] distribution, but it is inefficient for [[mesokurtic]] distributions, such as the normal.\n\nFor example, for a [[continuous uniform distribution]] with unknown maximum and minimum, the mid-range is the [[UMVU]] estimator for the mean. The [[sample maximum]] and sample minimum, together with sample size, are a sufficient statistic for the population maximum and minimum \u2013 the distribution of other samples, conditional on a given maximum and minimum, is just the uniform distribution between the maximum and minimum and thus add no information. See [[German tank problem]] for further discussion. Thus the mid-range, which is an unbiased and sufficient estimator of the population mean, is in fact the UMVU: using the sample mean just adds noise based on the uninformative distribution of points within this range.\n\nConversely, for the normal distribution, the sample mean is the UMVU estimator of the mean. Thus for platykurtic distributions, which can often be thought of as between a uniform distribution and a normal distribution, the informativeness of the middle sample points versus the extrema values varies from \"equal\" for normal to \"uninformative\" for uniform, and for different distributions, one or the other (or some combination thereof) may be most efficient. A robust analog is the [[trimean]], which averages the midhinge (25% trimmed mid-range) and median.\n\n===Small samples===\n\nFor small sample sizes (''n'' from 4 to 20) drawn from a sufficiently platykurtic distribution (negative [[excess kurtosis]], defined as \u03b3<sub>2</sub> = (\u03bc<sub>4</sub>/(\u03bc<sub>2</sub>)\u00b2)&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3), the mid-range is an efficient estimator of the mean ''\u03bc''.

The original Gilgamesh line-up consisted of Gowen, Travis, Morcombe, [[Jeff Clyne]] and [[Alan Wakeman]] on saxophone.\n\nThe band's line-up took a while to stabilise, with, for example, [[Richard Sinclair]] depping for Clyne on their debut performance in January 1973; soon afterwards it settled on the quartet of Gowen, Travis, [[Phil Lee (musician)|Phil Lee]] on guitar (recommended by Travis) and [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass. Regular gigs followed throughout 1973, including two special performances co-headlining with [[Hatfield and the North]] which included a \"double-quartet\" set consisting of a 40-minute composition by Gowen. A demo tape was also recorded for gig- and contract-hunting purposes.\nJaksoskndjowos\nIn late 1973, Murray was replaced by Steve Cook but gigs subsequently became ever sparser, despite a series of radio sessions for the BBC's jazz programmes. For one of those the quartet were augmented with a second keyboard player, Peter Lemer. In 1975, Gilgamesh finally secured a contract with Virgin's subsidiary label [[Caroline Records (UK)|Caroline Records]], and recorded their debut album in downtime at the Virgin-owned Manor Studios, with Hatfield's Dave Stewart acting as co-producer.\n\nGowen and Stewart had become friends over the previous months and discussed a possible collaboration, but Stewart was hesitant about being in two bands simultaneously. When [[Hatfield and the North]] finally broke up in mid-1975, Stewart joined Gilgamesh as auxiliary member, playing one gig and a couple of radio sessions with the group. Meanwhile, plans were laid for the Stewart-Gowen collaboration, which eventually materialised as [[National Health]] and also (briefly) included Gilgamesh guitarist Phil Lee. Gilgamesh themselves ceased operations in late 1975 following the cancellation of a proposed Scottish tour.\n\nAfter leaving National Health, in 1977 Gowen reformed Gilgamesh as a rehearsal-oriented unit with Murray, Lee and drummer [[Trevor Tomkins]] (a longtime collaborator of Lee's) for occasional rehearsals. A second album was recorded in June 1978, ''Another Fine Tune You've Got Me Into'' (released 1979 on Charly Records), with Gowen, Lee, Tomkins and bassist [[Hugh Hopper]], but the band had no further existence. Gowen died a few years later in 1981.\n\nIn 2000, [[Cuneiform Records]] released archive recordings of the band under the name ''Arriving Twice''.

The original Gilgamesh line-up consisted of Gowen, Travis, Morcombe, [[Jeff Clyne]] and [[Alan Wakeman]] on saxophone.\n\nThe band's line-up took a while to stabilise, with, for example, [[Richard Sinclair]] depping for Clyne on their debut performance in January 1973; soon afterwards it settled on the quartet of Gowen, Travis, [[Phil Lee (musician)|Phil Lee]] on guitar (recommended by Travis) and [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass. Regular gigs followed throughout 1973, including two special performances co-headlining with [[Hatfield and the North]] which included a \"double-quartet\" set consisting of a 40-minute composition by Gowen. A demo tape was also recorded for gig- and contract-hunting purposes.\n\nIn late 1973, Murray was replaced by Steve Cook but gigs subsequently became ever sparser, despite a series of radio sessions for the BBC's jazz programmes. For one of those the quartet were augmented with a second keyboard player, Peter Lemer. In 1975, Gilgamesh finally secured a contract with Virgin's subsidiary label [[Caroline Records (UK)|Caroline Records]], and recorded their debut album in downtime at the Virgin-owned Manor Studios, with Hatfield's Dave Stewart acting as co-producer.\n\nGowen and Stewart had become friends over the previous months and discussed a possible collaboration, but Stewart was hesitant about being in two bands simultaneously. When [[Hatfield and the North]] finally broke up in mid-1975, Stewart joined Gilgamesh as auxiliary member, playing one gig and a couple of radio sessions with the group. Meanwhile, plans were laid for the Stewart-Gowen collaboration, which eventually materialised as [[National Health]] and also (briefly) included Gilgamesh guitarist Phil Lee. Gilgamesh themselves ceased operations in late 1975 following the cancellation of a proposed Scottish tour.\n\nAfter leaving National Health, in 1977 Gowen reformed Gilgamesh as a rehearsal-oriented unit with Murray, Lee and drummer [[Trevor Tomkins]] (a longtime collaborator of Lee's) for occasional rehearsals. A second album was recorded in June 1978, ''Another Fine Tune You've Got Me Into'' (released 1979 on Charly Records), with Gowen, Lee, Tomkins and bassist [[Hugh Hopper]], but the band had no further existence. Gowen died a few years later in 1981.\n\nIn 2000, [[Cuneiform Records]] released archive recordings of the band under the name ''Arriving Twice''. It consists of the 1973 demo as well as two radio sessions from 1974\u201375. It features variously Gowen, Lee, Travis, Murray, Cook, Clyne and [[Peter Lemer]], and includes several previously unheard compositions, notably \"Extract\", from the unrecorded Gilgamesh/Hatfield and the North double-quartet piece.\n\n==Discography==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"background:#ffdead;\"\n|width=70px|Year\n|width=350px|Artist\n|Title\n|-\n|1975||Gilgamesh||''Gilgamesh''\n|-\n|1979||Gilgamesh||''Another Fine Tune You've Got Me Into''\n|-\n|2000||Gilgamesh||''Arriving Twice''\n|}\n\n==Filmography==\n* 2015: ''[[Romantic Warriors III: Canterbury Tales]]'' (DVD)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.calyx-canterbury.fr/bands/gilgamesh.html Gilgamesh FAQ at Calyx]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gilgamesh}}\n[[Category:Canterbury scene]]\n[[Category:Jazz fusion ensembles]]\n", "name_user": "Aeonia Sei", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_(band)"}

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The [[Executive Director]] runs the day-to-day operations of the group.

National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules.<ref name=mission/>\n\nThe club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P. Cohen, ''The History of the Sierra Club, 1892\u20131970'' (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Club's first goals included establishing [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]] and [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]] national parks, convincing the California legislature to give [[Yosemite Valley]] to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s.\n\nMuir escorted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity.<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\" /> Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy.

Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands.

Ehrlich|Anne]],<ref name=monitor/> wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of [[immigration to the United States]]. The Club's position was that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote.

National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules.<ref name=mission/>\n\nThe club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P. Cohen, ''The History of the Sierra Club, 1892\u20131970'' (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Club's first goals included establishing [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]] and [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]] national parks, convincing the California legislature to give [[Yosemite Valley]] to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s.\n\nMuir escorted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Broydo|first1=Leora|title=Mutiny at the Sierra Club|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/mutiny-sierra-club|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Mother Jones|date=November 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by [[Clorox]], which had been named one of a \"dangerous dozen\" chemical companies by the [[Public Interest Research Group]] in 2004.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

Ehrlich|Anne]],<ref name=monitor/> wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of [[immigration to the United States]]. The Club's position was that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.

It distinguished a different focus in their live concerts compared to their studio albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/1983/|title=Bless Its Pointed Little Head - Review|work=headheritage.co.uk|accessdate=March 1, 2015}} </ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2bT1mu97kC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=crown+of+creation+album+bonus+tracks&source=bl&ots=f5nZYIOE0v&sig=aeSVkCQonXz6tvISp0kGjTYnp_U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TaneVJXHIMjLoAT1oIKYBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBzgK|title=Guide Required Listening |work=Google.com|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side one\n| title1          = Clergy\n| note1           = recorded November 28\u201330 at [[Fillmore East]]\n| writer1         = [[Jefferson Airplane]]\n| length1         = 1:37\n| title2          = 3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\n| note2           = recorded October 24\u201326 at [[Fillmore West]]\n| writer2         = [[Marty Balin]]\n| length2         = 4:39\n| title3          = [[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\n| note3           = recorded October 24\u201326 at Fillmore West\n| writer3         = [[Darby Slick]]\n| length3         = 4:15\n| title4          = Fat Angel\n| note4           = recorded November 28\u201330 at Fillmore East\n| writer4         = [[Donovan|Donovan Leitch]]\n| length4         = 7:36\n| title5          = [[Rock Me Baby (song)|Rock Me Baby]]\n| note5           = recorded October 24\u201326 at Fillmore West\n| writer5         = traditional, arranged by Jefferson Airplane\n| length5         = 7:45\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = The Other Side of This Life\n| note1           = recorded October 24\u201326 at Fillmore West\n| writer1         = [[Fred Neil]]\n| length1         = 6:48\n| title2          = It's No Secret\n| note2           = recorded October 24\u201326 at Fillmore West\n| writer2         = Balin\n| length2         = 3:31\n| title3          = Plastic Fantastic Lover\n| note3           = recorded October 24\u201326 at Fillmore West\n| writer3         = Balin\n| length3         = 3:53\n| title4          = Turn Out the Lights\n| note4           = recorded November 28\u201330 at Fillmore East\n| writer4         = [[Paul Kantner]], [[Jack Casady]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Grace Slick]], [[Spencer Dryden]]\n| length4         = 1:24\n| title5          = Bear Melt\n| note5           = recorded November 28\u201330 at Fillmore East\n| writer5         = Kantner, Casady, Kaukonen, G.

In 2011 the state had 3,671,032 residents, constituting 0.3% of the country's population.\n\nThe area of modern Tripura\u2014ruled for several centuries by the [[Manikya dynasty]]\u2014was part of an independent [[princely state]]  under the protectorate of the [[British Raj|British Empire]]. The independent Tripuri Kingdom (also known as Hill Tippera) joined the newly independent India in 1949.\n\nTripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India, as only one major highway, the [[National Highway 8 (India)|National Highway 8]], connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges\u2014[[Boromura]], [[Atharamura]], [[Longtharai]], [[Shakhan]] and [[Jampui Hills]]\u2014run north to south, with intervening valleys; [[Agartala]], the capital, is located on a plain to the west.  The state has a [[tropical savanna climate]], and receives seasonal heavy rains from the [[southwest monsoon|south west monsoon]].  Forests cover more than half of the area, in which [[bamboo]] and [[cane (grass)|cane]] tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of [[primate]] species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is hindered.  Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.\n\nAccording to 2011 census, Tripura is one of the most literate states in India with a literacy rate of 87.75%. Mainstream Indian cultural elements coexist with traditional practices of the ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites [[Unakoti]], [[Pilak, Tripura|Pilak]] and [[Devtamura]] provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and tribal religions. The Great Chinmoy in Agartala was the former royal abode of the Tripuri king.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{further|Debbarma|Twipra}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] name of the state is linked to the Hindu goddess of beauty; [[Tripura Sundari]], the presiding deity of the [[Tripura Sundari Temple]] at [[Udaipur, Tripura|Udaipur]], one of the 51 ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'' (pilgrimage centres of ''[[Shaktism]]''),<ref name=\"hr name\"/><ref name=\"Debbarma1996\"/> and to the legendary tyrant king Tripur, who reigned in the region.

Railway service was established in Tripura in 1964 by constructing {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} track from [[Lumding]] in Assam to [[Dharmanagar]] and [[Kailasahar]] in Tripura but the track did not connect the state capital Agartala. Rail transport was absent in the state until 2008\u201309 when the railway track was extended to the capital Agartala.<ref name=\"ecorev 2011 195-201\"/> The metre gauge rail track was connected to {{RailGauge|1676mm}} [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] at Lumding. The major railway stations in this line are in Agartala, [[Dharmanagar]], and [[Kumarghat]]. This metre gauge track was converted to {{RailGauge|1676mm}} broad gauge in 2016 and now trains run from Agartala to [[Calcutta]] and [[Delhi]]. The total length of this railway track in Tripura state is 153&nbsp;km. It is a single line without electrification.\n\nExtension of the railway line from Agartala to the southernmost town of [[Sabroom]] at Bangladesh border is in progress. The 76&nbsp;km long track from Agartala to [[Belonia, India|Belonia]] railway station (station code BENA) has been commissioned and two trains run on this section. The 38&nbsp;km long section from Belonia to Sabroom on the bank of [[Feni River]], which separates Tripura from Bangladesh, is being constructed as of 2019.\n\nA new railway line is being laid westwards from Agartala to [[Akhaura]] in [[Bangladesh]].

In 2011 the state had 3,671,032 residents, constituting 0.3% of the country's population.\n\nThe area of modern Tripura\u2014ruled for several centuries by the [[Manikya dynasty]]\u2014was part of an independent [[princely state]]  under the protectorate of the [[British Raj|British Empire]]. The independent Tripuri Kingdom (also known as Hill Tippera) joined the newly independent India in 1949.\n\nTripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India, as only one major highway, the [[National Highway 8 (India)|National Highway 8]], connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges\u2014[[Boromura]], [[Atharamura]], [[Longtharai]], [[Shakhan]] and [[Jampui Hills]]\u2014run north to south, with intervening valleys; [[Agartala]], the capital, is located on a plain to the west.  The state has a [[tropical savanna climate]], and receives seasonal heavy rains from the [[southwest monsoon|south west monsoon]].  Forests cover more than half of the area, in which [[bamboo]] and [[cane (grass)|cane]] tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of [[primate]] species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is hindered.  Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.\n\nAccording to 2011 census, Tripura is one of the most literate states in India with a literacy rate of 87.75%. Mainstream Indian cultural elements coexist with traditional practices of the ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites [[Unakoti]], [[Pilak, Tripura|Pilak]] and [[Devtamura]] provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and tribal religions. The Great Chinmoy in Agartala was the former royal abode of the Tripuri king.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{further|Debbarma|Twipra}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] name of the state is linked to the Hindu goddess of beauty; [[Tripura Sundari]], the presiding deity of the [[Tripura Sundari Temple]] at [[Udaipur, Tripura|Udaipur]], one of the 51 ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'' (pilgrimage centres of ''[[Shaktism]]''),<ref name=\"hr name\"/><ref name=\"Debbarma1996\"/> and to the legendary tyrant king Tripur, who reigned in the region.
