Born into a large family from [[Charlemagne, Quebec]], she emerged as a teen star in her homeland with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She first gained international recognition by winning both the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]], where she [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988|represented Switzerland]]. After learning to speak English, she signed on to [[Epic Records]] in the United States. In 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'', establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.\n\nDuring the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English albums, such as ''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996) and ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997), which were both certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|diamond]] in the US. She also scored a series of international number-one hits, including \"[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Celine Dion version|The Power of Love]]\", \"[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]\", \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", \"[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#Celine Dion|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]\", \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\", and \"[[I'm Your Angel]]\". Dion continued releasing French albums between each English record; ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' (1998), ''[[Sans attendre]]'' (2012), and ''[[Encore un soir]]'' (2016), were all certified [[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|diamond]] in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a highly successful live performer with [[A New Day...]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] (2003\u201307), which remains the highest-grossing [[concert residency]] of all time, as well as the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] (2008\u201309), one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours of all time]].\n\nDion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] to [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[European classical music|classical]]. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices. She has won five [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

Born into a large family from [[Charlemagne, Quebec]], she emerged as a teen star in her homeland with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She first gained international recognition by winning both the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]], where she [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988|represented Switzerland]]. After learning to speak English, she signed on to [[Epic Records]] in the United States. In 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'', establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.\n\nDuring the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English albums, such as ''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996) and ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997), which were both certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|diamond]] in the US. She also scored a series of international number-one hits, including \"[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Celine Dion version|The Power of Love]]\", \"[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]\", \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", \"[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#Celine Dion|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]\", \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\", and \"[[I'm Your Angel]]\". Dion continued releasing French albums between each English record; ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' (1998), ''[[Sans attendre]]'' (2012), and ''[[Encore un soir]]'' (2016), were all certified [[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|diamond]] in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a highly successful live performer with [[A New Day...]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] (2003\u201307), which remains the highest-grossing [[concert residency]] of all time, as well as the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] (2008\u201309), one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours of all time]].\n\nDion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] to [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[European classical music|classical]]. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices. She has won five [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. ''Billboard'' named her the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Adult Contemporary]]\" for having the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)#Most number-one songs|most number ones]] on the radio format for a female artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7776996/the-illustrious-career-of-celine-dion|title=Being Celine: A Look Back at the Illustrious Career of Celine Dion |work=Billboard|author=Billboard Staff|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era.

Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was even more well-received commercially than ''Unison''; it was certified diamond in Canada and double platinum in the US. The album's second single \"[[If You Asked Me To#C\u00e9line Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]\" (a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') became her first [[List of number-one singles of 1992 (Canada)|number-one single]] in Canada and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nAlso during this time, Dion released the Francophone album ''[[Dion chante Plamondon]]''.

It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991\u20131992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. \"[[Un gar\u00e7on pas comme les autres (Ziggy)]]\" became a smash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold.

On February 23, 1929, [[Maddux Air Lines]] began the airport's first scheduled passenger service with a route between San Francisco and El Paso stopping in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and several other cities however the service was short lived, ending by autumn 1929. [[Standard Air Lines]] had been serving Phoenix since late 1927 through a different airport and began landing at Sky Harbor on August 5, 1929. Standard operated a route between Los Angeles and El Paso stopping at Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, Arizona. Standard was acquired by American Airways in 1930 which later became [[American Airlines]]. American extended the route eastward to New York by way of Dallas, Nashville, and many other cities making for a southern transcontinental route across the United States. In 1935 the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] purchased Sky Harbor airport from Acme for $100,000.\n \n[[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] began service to [[San Francisco]] in 1938 and added Phoenix onto its transcontinental network by 1944 with flights to Los Angeles and eastward to New York stopping at Albuquerque, Kansas City, and many more cities. \n[[Arizona Airways]] began intrastate service within Arizona in 1946 and merged into [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]] in 1950 which added new routes to Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso. \n[[Bonanza Airlines]] began service by 1951 with a route to Las Vegas and Reno making several stops at smaller communities. New routes to Salt Lake City and southern California were added in the 1960's along with nonstop flights to Las Vegas and Reno aboard [[Douglas DC-9]] jets in 1965. Bonanza merged with two other carriers to become [[Air West]] in 1968 and was changed to [[Hughes Airwest]] in 1970 adding several new routes, including service to Mexico, creating a hub at Phoenix. Hughes Airwest was then merged into [[Republic Airlines (1979-1986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1980 which continued the Phoenix hub operation until the mid 1980's. \n[[Western Airlines]] came to Sky Harbor in 1957 with flights to Denver, Los Angeles and San Diego, [[Continental Airlines]] came in 1961 to El Paso, Los Angeles, and Tucson, and [[Delta Air Lines]] began flights to Dallas by 1969. <ref>{{cite web |title=1935 and The Farm \u2013 Sky Harbor's Early Years and Memories |url=http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |website=Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport |date=August 30, 2010 |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627205926/http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Since airline deregulation in 1978, Phoenix has seen numerous new air carriers begin service including [[United Airlines]] in 1980 and [[Southwest Airlines]] in 1982.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the airport began work on a new passenger terminal, as well as a new parallel runway and a diagonal runway.<ref name=\"tempe\">{{cite web |title=Phoenix Sky Harbor \u2013 City of Tempe History |url=http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |work=[[Tempe, Arizona|City of Tempe]] |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914155141/http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> On the February 1953 C&GS diagram runways 8L and 8R are each {{convert|6000|ft}} long and runway 3 is {{convert|5500|ft}}.\n\nThe $835,000 Terminal 1 (originally called the \"West Wing\") which also had the first [[control tower]], opened in October 1952.<ref name=\"tempe\"/> It was torn down in 1991 and replaced by a [[cellphone lot|cell phone waiting lot]], with Terminal 1's parking lot now being the West Economy lot.\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 42 scheduled airline departures a day: 16 American, 11 TWA, 10 Bonanza, and 5 Frontier.
