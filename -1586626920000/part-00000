Along with works by other filmmakers such as [[Shuji Terayama]] and [[Donald Richie]], Obayashi's films would develop the tone of Japanese experimental cinema through the 1960s. In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of avant-garde techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films while earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements. Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works. In the 1970s he began a series of Japanese ads featuring well-known American stars such as [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]].<ref name=schillingvariety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/asia/tokyo-festival-nobuhiko-obayashi-labyrinth-cinema-1203381807/|title=Tokyo Film Festival: Nobuhiko Obayashi Re-enters 'Labyrinth of Cinema'|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=27 October 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> Throughout his career, Obayashi directed around 3,000 television commercials.<ref name=varietyrip>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/nobuhiko-obayashi-dies-dead-japanese-director-1234577784/|title=Nobuhiko Obayashi Japanese Director Dead at 82|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=10 April 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He made his feature film [[directorial debut]] with the horror film ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]'', released in 1977.<ref name=dargis /><ref name=atkinson>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/01/12/rediscovering-the-japanese-horror-flick-house/|title=Rediscovering the Japanese Horror Flick House|last=Atkinson|first=Michael|date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> The film employed a mixture of trick photography and avant-garde techniques to achieve its distinctive, surreal visuals, and has gone on to be considered a [[Cult film|cult classic]].

Along with works by other filmmakers such as [[Shuji Terayama]] and [[Donald Richie]], Obayashi's films would develop the tone of Japanese experimental cinema through the 1960s. In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of avant-garde techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films while earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements. Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works. In the 1970s he began a series of Japanese ads featuring well-known American stars such as [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]].<ref name=schillingvariety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/asia/tokyo-festival-nobuhiko-obayashi-labyrinth-cinema-1203381807/|title=Tokyo Film Festival: Nobuhiko Obayashi Re-enters 'Labyrinth of Cinema'|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=27 October 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> Throughout his career, Obayashi directed around 3,000 television commercials.<ref name=varietyrip>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/nobuhiko-obayashi-dies-dead-japanese-director-1234577784/|title=Nobuhiko Obayashi Japanese Director Dead at 82|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=10 April 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He made his feature film [[directorial debut]] with the horror film ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]'', released in 1977.<ref name=dargis /><ref name=atkinson>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/01/12/rediscovering-the-japanese-horror-flick-house/|title=Rediscovering the Japanese Horror Flick House|last=Atkinson|first=Michael|date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> The film employed a mixture of trick photography and avant-garde techniques to achieve its distinctive, surreal visuals, and has gone on to be considered a [[Cult film|cult classic]].

Sometimes called \"playing the studio\", the approach is typically embodied by artists or producers who place less emphasis on simply capturing live performances in studio and instead favor the creative use of studio technology in completing finished works.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Techniques include the incorporation of [[noise in music|non-musical sounds]], [[overdub]]bing, [[magnetic tape|tape]] edits, [[sound synthesis]], [[Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects|audio signal processing]], and combining segmented performances ([[Take#Music_recording|takes]]) into a unified whole.\n\nComposers have been exploiting the potentials of [[multitrack recording]] since the technology was made available to them. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape in the mid 1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition. By the late 1960s, in-studio composition had become standard practice, and remained so into the 2010s.

It's very hard to do anything interesting with a disc\".{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=128}} In the mid 1950s, popular recording conventions changed profoundly with the advent of three-track tape,{{sfn|Eno|2004|pp=128\u2013129}} and by the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with [[musical form]], [[orchestration]], [[reverberation|unnatural reverb]], and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] and [[Joe Meek]]'s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like [[the Tornados]].{{sfn|Blake|2009|p=45}}\n\nIn-studio composition became standard practice by the late 1960s and early 1970s, and remained so into the 2010s. During the 1970s, the \"studio as instrument\" concept shifted from the studio's recording space to the studio's control room, where electronic instruments could be plugged directly into the mixing console.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} As of the 2010s, the \"studio as instrument\" idea remains ubiquitous in genres such as [[pop music|pop]], [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]], and electronic music.<ref name=\"Ableton1\">{{cite web|title=A Brief History of The Studio As An Instrument: Part 1 - Early Reflections|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/studio-as-an-instrument-part-1/|website=Ableton.com|date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notable artists and works==\n===1940s\u20131950s===\n* Pioneers from the 1940s include [[Bill Putnam]], [[Les Paul]], and [[Tom Dowd]], who each contributed to the development of common recording practices like reverb, [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]], and [[overdubbing]]. Putnam was one of the first to recognize echo and reverb as elements to enhance a recording, rather than as natural byproducts of the recording space. He engineered [[the Harmonicats]]' 1947 novelty song \"[[Peg o' My Heart]]\", which was a significant chart hit and became the first popular recording to use artificial reverb for artistic effect.<ref name=\"Ableton1\"/> Although Les Paul was not the first to use overdubs, he popularized the technique in the 1950s.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=12, 39}}\n\n* Around the same time, French composers [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry]] were developing ''[[musique concrete]]'', a method of composition in which pieces of tape are rearranged and spliced together, and thus originated [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Meanwhile in England, [[Daphne Oram]] experimented heavily with [[electronic instrument]]s during her tenure as a balancing engineer for the [[BBC]], however, her tape experiments were mostly unheard at the time.<ref name=\"Ableton1\"/>\n\n===1950s\u20131960s===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Telstar.ogg\n|title=The Tornadoes \u2013 \"Telstar\" (1962)\n|pos=right\n|description  = Meek's best-known production, \"[[Telstar (song)|Telstar]]\", features a sped-up piano, a [[clavioline]] overdubbed three times, and a guitar that fades in and out of the recording.<ref name=\"Ableton1\"/> The piece won an [[Ivor Novello Award]] and sold over five million copies worldwide.\n}}\n\n* English producer [[Joe Meek]] is considered one of the most influential engineers of all time,{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} being one of the first to exploit the use of recording studios as instruments, and one of the first producers to assert an [[auteur|individual identity as an artist]].<ref name=\"tmtpat2013\">{{cite web|last1=Patrick|first1=Jonathan|title=Joe Meek's pop masterpiece ''I Hear a New World'' gets the chance to haunt a whole new generation of audiophile geeks|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/joe-meeks-pop-masterpiece-i-hear-a-new-world-gets-the-chance-to-haunt-a-whole-new-generation-of|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref> He got his start in 1955 at [[IBC Studios]] in London. One of Meek's signature techniques was to overload a signal with [[dynamic range compression]], which was unorthodox at the time. He was antagonized by his employers for his \"radical\" techniques. Some of these methods, such as close-miking instruments, later became part of normal recording practice.<ref name=\"Ableton1\"/>\n\n* Discussing [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], Adam Bell describes the songwriting duo's productions for [[the Coasters]] as \"an excellent example of their pioneering practices in the emerging field of production\", citing an account from Stoller in which he recalls \"cutting esses off words, sticking the tape back together so you didn't notice. And sometimes if the first refrain on a take was good and the second one lousy, we'd tape another recording of the first one and stick it in place of the second one.\"{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=39}}\n\n* Phil Spector, sometimes regarded as Joe Meek's American counterpart,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gritten|first1=David|title=Joe Meek and the tragic demise of the maverick who revolutionised British pop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/joe-meek-and-the-tragic-demise-of-the-maverick-who-revolutionise/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 1, 2016}}</ref> is also considered \"important as the first star producer of popular music and its first 'auteur' ... Spector changed pop music from a performing art ... to an art which could sometimes exist only in the recording studio\".{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} His original production formula (dubbed the \"Wall of Sound\") called for large ensembles (including some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar]]s), with multiple instruments doubling and even tripling many of the parts to create a fuller, richer sound.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=77}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, Spector would often duplicate a part played by an [[acoustic piano]] with an [[electric piano]] and a [[harpsichord]].{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} Session guitarist [[Barney Kessel]] notes: \"Musically, it was terribly simple, but the way he recorded and miked it, they\u2019d diffuse it so that you couldn't pick out any one instrument. Techniques like distortion and echo were not new, but Phil came along and took these to make sounds that had not been used in the past.
