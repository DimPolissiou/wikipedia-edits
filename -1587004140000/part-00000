The resulting concession of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] compromised China's territorial sovereignty. The clashes included the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u20131842), with the British naval forces, and the [[Second Opium War]] (1856\u20131860), also known as the Arrow or Anglo-French Wars by the Chinese (because Britain was aided by French forces). The wars and the subsequently-imposed treaties weakened the Qing dynasty and Chinese governments, and forced China to open specified [[treaty ports]] (especially Shanghai and Canton) that handled all trade with imperial powers.<ref name=\"short\">{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/heroin/opiwar1.htm |title=A Short History of the Opium Wars (from: ''Civilizations Past And Present'', Chapter 29: South And East Asia, 1815\u20131914) |author1=Taylor Wallbank |author2=Bailkey |author3=Jewsbury |author4=Lewis |author5=Hackett |year=1992}}</ref><ref name=\"eb\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Opium-Wars |title=Chinese history: Opium Wars |author=Kenneth Pletcher |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]}}</ref> Around this time China's economy also contracted slightly, but the sizable [[Taiping Rebellion]] and [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]] had a much larger effect.<ref name=\"industrial2010\">{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=Jeff |last2=Rosenband |first2=Leonard N. |last3=Smith |first3=Merritt Roe |title=Reconceptualizing the Industrial Revolution |date=2010 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-28950-4}}</ref><ref name=\"industrial2001\">{{cite book |last1=Pomeranz |first1=Kenneth |title=The great divergence : China, Europe, and the making of the modern world economy |date=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691090108}}</ref>[[Angus Maddison statistics of the ten largest economies by GDP (PPP)|<sup>[3]</sup>]]<ref>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/over-2000-years-of-economic-history-in-one-chart</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Peter |title=Karl Marx, part 4: 'Workers of the world, unite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/25/karl-marx-communist-manifesto |accessdate=22 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nBritish merchants began selling opium to China.

In spite of this, a new Imperial Commissioner, Yeh Ming-ch'en, was appointed at Canton, the principal trading port of foreigners; he was determined to stamp out the illegal opium trade. In October 1856 he seized the British ship ''Arrow'' and threw its crew into chains. Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hong Kong, called up Admiral Sir Michael Seymour's fleet which, on 23 October, bombarded and captured the forts which guarded the approach to Canton on the Pearl River, and then proceeded to bombard Canton itself but had insufficient forces to take and hold the city. On 15 December, during a riot in Canton, European commercial properties were set on fire and Bowring appealed for military intervention.<ref name=\"Haythornthwaite, 2000, p.239\" /> Following the murder of a French missionary, Britain now had French support.

In spite of this, a new Imperial Commissioner, Yeh Ming-ch'en, was appointed at Canton, the principal trading port of foreigners; he was determined to stamp out the illegal opium trade. In October 1856 he seized the British ship ''Arrow'' and threw its crew into chains. Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hong Kong, called up Admiral Sir Michael Seymour's fleet which, on 23 October, bombarded and captured the forts which guarded the approach to Canton on the Pearl River, and then proceeded to bombard Canton itself but had insufficient forces to take and hold the city. On 15 December, during a riot in Canton, European commercial properties were set on fire and Bowring appealed for military intervention.<ref name=\"Haythornthwaite, 2000, p.239\" /> Following the murder of a French missionary, Britain now had French support. Britain now sought greater concessions from China, including legalization of the [[opium trade]], to expand trade in ''[[coolie]]s'' (cheap laborers), to open all of China to British merchants and opium traffickers, and to exempt foreign imports from [[Likin (taxation)|internal transit duties]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Zhihong Shi|title=Central Government Silver Treasury: Revenue, Expenditure and Inventory Statistics, ca. 1667\u20131899|year=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-30733-9|page=33}}</ref>  The war resulted in the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (26 June 1858), which forced the Chinese to pay reparations for the expenses of the recent war, open a second group of ten ports to European commerce, legalize the opium trade, and grant foreign traders and missionaries rights to travel within China.<ref name=\"Haythornthwaite, 2000, p.239\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of opium in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  Beeching, Jack.

Once they turn in the Golden Brick for immunity, it is then made available as the reward for a future challenge.
