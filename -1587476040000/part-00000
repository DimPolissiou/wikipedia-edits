In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.

He was the fifth child in a household of four boys and five girls. His father, Narayandas (\"Nav Narayan\") Raina, was the first person to have introduced [[houseboat]]s in the [[Kashmir Valley]].<ref 1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchkashmir.org/2010/10/origin-of-kashmiri-house-boat-and-some.html|title=Search Kashmir - in bits and pieces.|last=Razdan|first=Vinayak|date=10 October 2010|website=Origin of Kashmir|publisher=Search Kashmir|access-date= 29 March 2016}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His mother's name was Arnyamali Raina.\n\nAt the age of five he was introduced to the path of spirituality by his elder brother Maheshvaranath. Up to the age of eight his spiritual progress in the lineage of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivam]] was monitored by his family priest, [[Pandit]] Swami Ram Joo (1854-1915), and later by his chief disciple Swami Mehatab Kak (1870?-1942). At the age of 19, it is said, he experienced a clear taste of [[Self-realisation]]. Shortly afterwards he left home, as he wrote, \"in search of the Supreme\" and moved to the famous [[ashram]] of Sadhamalyun (Sadhuganga) in [[Handwara]]. Persuaded by his father to return to Srinagar, he continued to study [[Sanskrit]] and [[Shaiva philosophy]] under the guidance of a scholar named Maheshwar Razdan.\n\nIn 1934-35, he moved to an isolated place above the village of Gupta Ganga near [[Nishat]] suburb of [[Srinagar]] where his parents built him a house. This was a place where [[Abhinavagupta]] had lived nine centuries before. In 1962 he moved down the hill to a place closer to the famous [[Dal Lake]] a few hundred metres from the [[Nishat Gardens]].\n\nAround the age of 30 he traveled in India, spending time on a [[Bombay]] beach and a short time with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Sevagram]] and then with [[Sri Aurobindo]] at [[Pondicherry]]. From there he found his way to [[Tiruvannamalai]] to meet [[Ramana Maharshi]]. There he spent some weeks and later commented; \"I felt those golden days were indeed divine\".\n\nLittle was known about the Swami for almost three decades (1930-1960), as it was his habit to spend the winter months in silence and seclusion. Still, in the summer he had occasional visits from both scholars and saints. The Indian Spiritual Master [[Meher Baba]] visited his ashram in 1944. In 1948 [[Lilian Silburn]] from the [[National Centre for Scientific Research]], Paris, visited the Swami. She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that [[Andr\u00e9 Padoux]], another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. [[Paul Reps]], the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. This teaching also influenced [[Rajneesh|Osho]], and formed the basis of ''The Book of Secrets''. It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in [[Varanasi]], chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar [[Gopinath Kaviraj]], that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshmanjoo. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba [[Muktananda]], of [[Siddha Yoga]] also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving  weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism.  Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo's interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian of western [[Indologist]]s. The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991,  Swamiji traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by the Ishwar Ashram Trust, an organisation which was founded by him. The Ishwar Ashram Trust continues to publish works of the commentary of Shaivacharya Swami Lakshmanjoo on various Shaivite Text. <www.ishwarashramtrust.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n* 1933 \u2013 ''[[Gitartha Samgraha]]'' ([[Abhinavagupta]]'s commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]])\n* 1943 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Sambpanchashika]]''\n* 1958 \u2013 ''Sri Kramanayadipika'' (Hindi) on the 12 Kali-s\n* 1964 \u2013 Hindi translation of [[Utpaladeva]]'s ''[[Shivastotravali]]''\n* 1982 \u2013 Lectures on practice and discipline in Kashmir Shaivism\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme'', edited by John Hughes (the essence of the first fifteen chapters of Abhinavagupta's ''Tantraloka'')\n* 1986 \u2013 Hindi commentary by Swami Lakshman Joo on Abhinavagupta's ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha''\n* 1987 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Panchastavi]]''\nPosthumously:\n* 1992 \u2013 ''Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism, Oral Teachings of Swami Lakshmanjoo'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 English translation of ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 ''Shiva Sutras'' of Vasugupta along with original audio recordings\n* 2005 \u2013 ''Revelations on Grace and Spiritual Practice'', original audio and DVD recordings\n* 2006 \u2013 ''Trika Rahasya Prakriya'', Sanskrit verses with Hindi commentary\n* 2007 \u2013 ''[[Vijnana Bhairava]]'', original audio and transcript, introduction by John Hughes\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha'' of Abhinavagupta (Revisited), Chapters 1\u20136, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD\n* 2013 \u2013 ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 in the Light of Kashmir Shaivism'', Chapters 1-18, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD \n* 2015 \u2013 ''Paramarthasara with Abhinavagupta's commentary'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original DVD and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, chapter One'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript. \n* 2016 \u2013 ''Spanda Karika of Vasugupta, and Spanda Sandoha of Kshemaraja'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Stava Cintamani of Bhatta Narayana'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n\n=== Kashmir Shaivism \u2013 Library ===\n\nOver a period of nineteen years John Hughes recorded Lakshman Joo's translations of the following texts.

She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that [[Andr\u00e9 Padoux]], another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. [[Paul Reps]], the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. This teaching also influenced [[Rajneesh|Osho]], and formed the basis of ''The Book of Secrets''. It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in [[Varanasi]], chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar [[Gopinath Kaviraj]], that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshmanjoo. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba [[Muktananda]], of [[Siddha Yoga]] also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving  weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism.  Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo's interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian of western [[Indologist]]s. The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991,  Swamiji traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by the Ishwar Ashram Trust, an organisation which was founded by him. The Ishwar Ashram Trust continues to publish works of the commentary of Shaivacharya Swami Lakshmanjoo on various Shaivite Text. <www.ishwarashramtrust.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n* 1933 \u2013 ''[[Gitartha Samgraha]]'' ([[Abhinavagupta]]'s commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]])\n* 1943 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Sambpanchashika]]''\n* 1958 \u2013 ''Sri Kramanayadipika'' (Hindi) on the 12 Kali-s\n* 1964 \u2013 Hindi translation of [[Utpaladeva]]'s ''[[Shivastotravali]]''\n* 1982 \u2013 Lectures on practice and discipline in Kashmir Shaivism\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme'', edited by John Hughes (the essence of the first fifteen chapters of Abhinavagupta's ''Tantraloka'')\n* 1986 \u2013 Hindi commentary by Swami Lakshman Joo on Abhinavagupta's ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha''\n* 1987 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Panchastavi]]''\nPosthumously:\n* 1992 \u2013 ''Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism, Oral Teachings of Swami Lakshmanjoo'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 English translation of ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 ''Shiva Sutras'' of Vasugupta along with original audio recordings\n* 2005 \u2013 ''Revelations on Grace and Spiritual Practice'', original audio and DVD recordings\n* 2006 \u2013 ''Trika Rahasya Prakriya'', Sanskrit verses with Hindi commentary\n* 2007 \u2013 ''[[Vijnana Bhairava]]'', original audio and transcript, introduction by John Hughes\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha'' of Abhinavagupta (Revisited), Chapters 1\u20136, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD\n* 2013 \u2013 ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 in the Light of Kashmir Shaivism'', Chapters 1-18, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD \n* 2015 \u2013 ''Paramarthasara with Abhinavagupta's commentary'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original DVD and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, chapter One'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript. \n* 2016 \u2013 ''Spanda Karika of Vasugupta, and Spanda Sandoha of Kshemaraja'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Stava Cintamani of Bhatta Narayana'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n\n=== Kashmir Shaivism \u2013 Library ===\n\nOver a period of nineteen years John Hughes recorded Lakshman Joo's translations of the following texts.

It was originally named '''Maldon''' but was renamed '''Maldon East''' in 1889 and then '''Maldon East and Heybridge''' in 1907.\n\nIt was a terminus station located at the end of two branch lines from Witham and [[South Woodham Ferrers railway station|Woodham Ferrers]]. A plan dated 1920 shows that the station had a goods shed and a two-road engine shed. A turntable was situated adjacent to the station building and there were sidings that served the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation|Blackwater Canal]] and the river wharf.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=3}}</ref>\n\nBoth lines and the station closed to passenger services in 1964 as part of the [[Beeching closures]].\n\n== Description==\nThe station building at Maldon is an impressive example of Victorian railway architecture. The reason behind this is during the 1847 election the potential MP ([[David Waddington (Essex)|David Waddington]] a vice-chair of the Eastern Counties Railway) was looking to woo his constituents. A lot of local people found employment on the construction of the railway and it was reported in an investigation into the election afterwards that some of these were not actually fit to do the work they were paid for.  \nThe station building was built in the Jacobean style, with a large booking hall, waiting rooms and ticket office on the ground floor. The upper floor contained  the station master\u2019s apartments which were reached by a winding staircase from the booking hall. Originally the single platform was partly covered by a glass roof but this was removed after an explosion of an engine boiler caused significant damage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=5}}</ref>\n\nA second bay platform was added in 1889.\n\n[[File:Maldon East Railway Station - geograph.org.uk - 519479.jpg|thumb|Maldon East Railway Station building]]\n\n==History==\nThe branch from Witham was part of a scheme to link Braintree (\"the granary of Essex\") with its traditional port at Maldon. The scheme started in 1845 as a direct link from Braintree rather than the two branches that were actually built. It soon ran into financial trouble and was taken over by the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] keen to ensure there was no competition for its own interests. And this was before work actually started\n\nConstruction started in March 1847 and the first goods trains ran in August 1848 followed by the opening to passenger trains on 2 October of the same year.\n\nIn 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER).\n\nThe station was originally named Maldon, but after the opening of the Maldon West line on 1 October 1889,<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\">{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=B D J|title=The Woodham Ferrers - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=October 1978|volume=16|page=4}}</ref> the station was renamed to Maldon East. The 50 foot diameter turntable (manufactured by [[Ransomes & Rapier]] of [[Ipswich]] was installed at this time and a second platform was added to the west of the station building at this time.\n\nIn 1907 the station was further renamed to Maldon East and Heybridge as its actual position is half way between the two villages.\n\nAt the beginning of  1923 operation of the station was taken over by the [[London & North Eastern Railway]].\n\nIn 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure. The branch saw heavy usage in World War 2 with additional freight traffic.<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\"/>\n\nFollowing nationalisation of the railways in 1948 the station became part of [[British Railways]] Eastern Region.\nIn 1953 the Woodham Ferrers branch was closed - it had been operating one goods service per weekday for many years. However between 31 January 1957 and 31 January 1959 the line did re-open for freight as far as [[Maldon West railway station|Maldon West]] with trains reversing at Maldon East and Heybridge station.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=B D J|title=The Woodham Ferrers - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=October 1978|volume=16|page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958 Railbuses started operating the line to Witham with an improved schedule and in 1959 more frequent services were introduced. It was however too late as the rise of road transport and cheaper competing bus services saw the Witham branch carrying just 400 passengers per day. It is thought by 1959 the engine shed had closed (<sup>precise date unknown</sup> ) as no steam locomotives were using the branch.<ref name=\"Goldsmith 1977 9\">{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe line was slated for closure in the [[Beeching Report]] and despite the efforts of local campaigners the last passenger train ran on 6 September 1964. Freight lingered on with gravel and fruit traffic until 15 April 1966.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=11}}</ref>\n\n==Locomotives==\n\nEx Norfolk Railway 2-4-0 locomotives worked early trains on the branch.\n\nFrom GER days until 1958 the passenger service was generally in the hands of a GER Class M15 (LNE class F4 2-4-2T engine hauling two GER corridor coaches (three in summer). Occasionally GER Class Y14 (LNE class J15) 0-6-0 locomotives worked passenger services as did a T26 (LNE Class E4 2-4-0) for one summer.\n\nOther GER tank engines occasionally worked passenger services and 0-6-0T engines from the R24 (LNE class J67) and C72 (LNE class J68) classes worked goods traffic  until succumbing to dieselisation.\n\nFrom 1958 the station  was operated by  the first generation of BR Railbuses numbers E79960-E79964 which were based at Cambridge and which also worked a number of lightly used East Anglian branch lines.  The [[British Rail Class 15|Class 15]] locomotives took over freight workings as weight restrictions on the timber bridges on the branch meant nothing heavier could work as far as Maldon. A member of this class operated the last goods train in April 1966.\n\n==Maldon engine shed==\nThis was a substantial two track building. Until the Maldon West branch opened in 1889 there was no turntable located at Maldon so any tender engines working the branch would have had to have worked one direction tender first. In organisational terms Maldon was a sub-shed of Colchester and any locomotives needing heavy repair were sent there.\n\nIn GER days the shed had two drivers, two acting drivers, four firemen and a boiler washer (who probably did most of the odd jobs around the shed as well).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Chris|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Volume 2|year=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|location=Didcot|isbn=0 906867 48 7|pages=286\u2013288|author2=Reeves G}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1922 the shed had an allocation of four [[GER Class C32]] 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F3) and a single [[GER Class Y65]] 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F7 and nicknamed Crystal Palace tanks).\n\nThe shed closed sometime after dieselisation c 1959.\n\n==Goods traffic==\nThe sidings to the River Blackwater and Blackwater Canal provided additional traffic. As well as agricultural produce there was significant coal traffic in the early years of the railway.\n\n==Train services==\nIn 1847 there were 5 trains each way to Witham.\nBetween 1874 and 1883 there were nine services per day to Witham,  but ten years later this had reduced to seven. Bradshaw\u2019s Timetable Guide for 1910 shows seven trains per day with two additional services on a Wednesday (market day?). By 1939 there were nine services per day but it was not until 1958 and the introduction of Diesel Multiple Units that  the branch enjoyed a service of 17 trains per day.<ref name=\"Goldsmith 1977 9\"/>\n\nOn opening the Woodham Ferrers branch was served by five trains per day and this struggled for traffic throughout its life. By 1914 there were six trains per day although this reduced during the First World War. In 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure and never restarted.\n<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\"/>\n\n==Since closure==\nThe station building has survived and was for many years a restaurant. As of August 2013 it is largely surrounded  by an industrial estate although its impressive frontage can still be viewed from Station Road.\n\nThe original large goods shed stood until May 2008 when it was illegally demolished to make way for development.<ref>https://www.itsaboutmaldon.co.uk/railway/</ref>\n\n<center>'''Former Services'''</center>{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line two to one |previous1=[[Langford and Ulting railway station|Langford and Ulting]] |route1=[[Great Eastern Railway]]<br /><small>[[Witham-Maldon branch line]]</small>\n|previous2={{stnlnk|Maldon West}} |route2=[[Great Eastern Railway]]<br /><small>Maldon to Woodham Ferrers</small> |col={{GER colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#584,207,1 Maldon East and Heybridge station on navigable 1945 O.

The reason behind this is during the 1847 election the potential MP ([[David Waddington (Essex)|David Waddington]] a vice-chair of the Eastern Counties Railway) was looking to woo his constituents. A lot of local people found employment on the construction of the railway and it was reported in an investigation into the election afterwards that some of these were not actually fit to do the work they were paid for.  \nThe station building was built in the Jacobean style, with a large booking hall, waiting rooms and ticket office on the ground floor. The upper floor contained  the station master\u2019s apartments which were reached by a winding staircase from the booking hall. Originally the single platform was partly covered by a glass roof but this was removed after an explosion of an engine boiler caused significant damage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=5}}</ref>\n\nA second bay platform was added in 1889.\n\n[[File:Maldon East Railway Station - geograph.org.uk - 519479.jpg|thumb|Maldon East Railway Station building]]\n\n==History==\nThe branch from Witham was part of a scheme to link Braintree (\"the granary of Essex\") with its traditional port at Maldon. The scheme started in 1845 as a direct link from Braintree rather than the two branches that were actually built. It soon ran into financial trouble and was taken over by the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] keen to ensure there was no competition for its own interests. And this was before work actually started\n\nConstruction started in March 1847 and the first goods trains ran in August 1848 followed by the opening to passenger trains on 2 October of the same year.\n\nIn 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER).\n\nThe station was originally named Maldon, but after the opening of the Maldon West line on 1 October 1889,<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\">{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=B D J|title=The Woodham Ferrers - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=October 1978|volume=16|page=4}}</ref> the station was renamed to Maldon East. The 50 foot diameter turntable (manufactured by [[Ransomes & Rapier]] of [[Ipswich]] was installed at this time and a second platform was added to the west of the station building at this time.\n\nIn 1907 the station was further renamed to Maldon East and Heybridge as its actual position is half way between the two villages.\n\nAt the beginning of  1923 operation of the station was taken over by the [[London & North Eastern Railway]].\n\nIn 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure. The branch saw heavy usage in World War 2 with additional freight traffic.<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\"/>\n\nFollowing nationalisation of the railways in 1948 the station became part of [[British Railways]] Eastern Region.\nIn 1953 the Woodham Ferrers branch was closed - it had been operating one goods service per weekday for many years. However between 31 January 1957 and 31 January 1959 the line did re-open for freight as far as [[Maldon West railway station|Maldon West]] with trains reversing at Maldon East and Heybridge station.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=B D J|title=The Woodham Ferrers - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=October 1978|volume=16|page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958 Railbuses started operating the line to Witham with an improved schedule and in 1959 more frequent services were introduced. It was however too late as the rise of road transport and cheaper competing bus services saw the Witham branch carrying just 400 passengers per day. It is thought by 1959 the engine shed had closed (<sup>precise date unknown</sup> ) as no steam locomotives were using the branch.<ref name=\"Goldsmith 1977 9\">{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe line was slated for closure in the [[Beeching Report]] and despite the efforts of local campaigners the last passenger train ran on 6 September 1964. Freight lingered on with gravel and fruit traffic until 15 April 1966.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=11}}</ref>\n\n==Locomotives==\n\nEx Norfolk Railway 2-4-0 locomotives worked early trains on the branch.\n\nFrom GER days until 1958 the passenger service was generally in the hands of a GER Class M15 (LNE class F4 2-4-2T engine hauling two GER corridor coaches (three in summer). Occasionally GER Class Y14 (LNE class J15) 0-6-0 locomotives worked passenger services as did a T26 (LNE Class E4 2-4-0) for one summer.\n\nOther GER tank engines occasionally worked passenger services and 0-6-0T engines from the R24 (LNE class J67) and C72 (LNE class J68) classes worked goods traffic  until succumbing to dieselisation.\n\nFrom 1958 the station  was operated by  the first generation of BR Railbuses numbers E79960-E79964 which were based at Cambridge and which also worked a number of lightly used East Anglian branch lines.  The [[British Rail Class 15|Class 15]] locomotives took over freight workings as weight restrictions on the timber bridges on the branch meant nothing heavier could work as far as Maldon. A member of this class operated the last goods train in April 1966.\n\n==Maldon engine shed==\nThis was a substantial two track building. Until the Maldon West branch opened in 1889 there was no turntable located at Maldon so any tender engines working the branch would have had to have worked one direction tender first. In organisational terms Maldon was a sub-shed of Colchester and any locomotives needing heavy repair were sent there.\n\nIn GER days the shed had two drivers, two acting drivers, four firemen and a boiler washer (who probably did most of the odd jobs around the shed as well).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Chris|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Volume 2|year=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|location=Didcot|isbn=0 906867 48 7|pages=286\u2013288|author2=Reeves G}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1922 the shed had an allocation of four [[GER Class C32]] 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F3) and a single [[GER Class Y65]] 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F7 and nicknamed Crystal Palace tanks).\n\nThe shed closed sometime after dieselisation c 1959.\n\n==Goods traffic==\nThe sidings to the River Blackwater and Blackwater Canal provided additional traffic. As well as agricultural produce there was significant coal traffic in the early years of the railway.\n\n==Train services==\nIn 1847 there were 5 trains each way to Witham.\nBetween 1874 and 1883 there were nine services per day to Witham,  but ten years later this had reduced to seven. Bradshaw\u2019s Timetable Guide for 1910 shows seven trains per day with two additional services on a Wednesday (market day?). By 1939 there were nine services per day but it was not until 1958 and the introduction of Diesel Multiple Units that  the branch enjoyed a service of 17 trains per day.<ref name=\"Goldsmith 1977 9\"/>\n\nOn opening the Woodham Ferrers branch was served by five trains per day and this struggled for traffic throughout its life. By 1914 there were six trains per day although this reduced during the First World War. In 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure and never restarted.\n<ref name=\"Walsh 1978 4\"/>\n\n==Since closure==\nThe station building has survived and was for many years a restaurant. As of August 2013 it is largely surrounded  by an industrial estate although its impressive frontage can still be viewed from Station Road.\n\nThe original large goods shed stood until May 2008 when it was illegally demolished to make way for development.<ref>https://www.itsaboutmaldon.co.uk/railway/</ref>\n\n<center>'''Former Services'''</center>{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line two to one |previous1=[[Langford and Ulting railway station|Langford and Ulting]] |route1=[[Great Eastern Railway]]<br /><small>[[Witham-Maldon branch line]]</small>\n|previous2={{stnlnk|Maldon West}} |route2=[[Great Eastern Railway]]<br /><small>Maldon to Woodham Ferrers</small> |col={{GER colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#584,207,1 Maldon East and Heybridge station on navigable 1945 O.
