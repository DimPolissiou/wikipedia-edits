{"title_page": "Clap note", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Notability|Neologisms|date=February 2016}}\n}}\n\n'''Clap note''' is an unofficial shorthand term describing an interest-only financing tool used by certain institutional investors, such as major corporations for the purpose of funding new real-estate acquisitions.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe instrument is called a \u2018clap note\u2019 because it provides the same interest rate \u2018out of two different hands\u2019 (\u201cit takes two hands to clap\u201d). For example, a so-called \u201c10/10 Clap Note\u201d is one that is sold at a 10% discount on the face value while simultaneously paying 10% annual interest. The investor in a $100,000 10/10 clap note can buy the note at a discount of 10%, or $90,000 yet be paid 10% interest per year on the full face value of the note (i.e. $10,000). Then, since the note is an interest-only instrument, when the term expires, the investor receives the full face value, which includes another 10% profit.\n\nTherefore, the \u201cfist hand\u201d of the clap note is the annual interest rate of 10% and the \u201csecond hand\u201d is the 10% profit paid at the end of the term of the note, which is normally 24 months.\n\nBecause clap notes are not available to the general public and are generally only sold to \u2018insiders,\u2019 there appears to be no standard name for these instruments. Frequently the official name or heading on the note includes the name of the corporation on whose behalf the note is issued, e.g., \u201cXYZ Corporation Interest Only Real Estate Discount Note Issue #1234\u201d or something similar.\n\n==Functionality==\nIn the United States, clap notes usually have terms exceeding 12 months but invariably not longer than 24 months. This allows the investor to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax treatment while ensuring that the principal is still returned in a timely manner. In any case, the company that issues the note usually does not intend to use it as a long-term financing strategy.\n\nThe combination of a relatively short term with comparatively high interest, in contrast to other options available to investors, like certificates of deposit (CDs), makes clap notes very attractive to investors who can afford them. Using the example above, assuming that the $100,000 10/10 clap note has a term of two years, the investor sees a return on his $90,000 principal of $10,000 per year (i.e. $20,000) plus another $10,000 when the term ends. On the $90,000 principal that would be a return on investment (ROI) of $30,000 (i.e. 33.33%) over a two-year period or 16.66% per annum (APR). At the time of this writing, that return represents more than four times the rate available on a comparable CD at a reputable U.S. bank.\n\nThe other attraction to investors is the penalty-free monthly cash flow that the clap note provides from the \u201cfirst hand.\u201d  Using the example above, the investor can expect a monthly payment amounting to 10% \u00f7 12 (i.e., 0.833%) of the $100,000 face value, or $833.33. Considering that the investment was only $90,000, the monthly cash flow equates to an annualized return of 11.11%, which carries no penalties if he decides to sell the note prior its 24-month maturity date. CDs always attract penalties if the investor pulls out early.\n\n==Exclusivity==\nSmall investors are usually excluded from these investment opportunities, because clap notes tend to have face values in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also, they are normally only offered to insiders\u2014persons who have invested with the particular entity in the past.\n\nThe very structure of the note encourages the investor to reinvest the full face value for additional tax savings if another note is available for investment. In the U.S., this tax saving strategy is accomplished by what is known as a [https://www.inside1031.com/1031-exchange/ 1031 Exchange]. The IRS allows the investor to defer payment of any taxes on the profit made on the \u201csecond hand\u201d (in the case of the above example, that would be $10,000) indefinitely into the future if the investor \u201cexchanges\u201d the investment for a similar one, which, in practice, means that the investor could buy another clap note with a face value of $111,111, thus instantly saving about $3,300 in taxes and simultaneously making another $11,111 in profit on his original investment of $90,000.\n\nAnother strategy used by corporations issuing clap notes to exclude small-time speculators is a waiting period before the first payment is made. Strictly speaking, clap notes are private mortgages on real estate. As such, the payments made to the investors from the \u201cfirst hand\u201d are remitted monthly. However, since the interest rates on clap notes are so attractive, individuals might be tempted to get low-interest loans from banks and other sources under false pretenses and invest the money in a clap note. A four- to six-month waiting period at the beginning of the note term is intended to discourage such behavior.\n\n==Origin==\nIt is unclear when clap notes first appeared in the U.S. However, some who have been involved with clap notes for several decades believe that clap notes first appeared in the late-1970s. To put this in perspective it is necessary to recall that in the late 1960s to early 1970s the main influences on the U.S. economy were the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate]] Scandal. The super-inflation of the period resulted in returns of as much as 17% on CDs, while the stock market was taking a plunge. When the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] started in 1973, real estate prices plummeted. Institutional property investors, recognizing the opportunity, borrowed money at high interest rates from banks to buy these property bargains. When interest rates dropped again a short time later, they refinanced their acquisitions at lower rates.\n\nThe drop in interest rates caused CD investors to pull their money back out of CDs and start looking for new high-yield instruments. It is not really clear how these former CD investors and the institutional property buyers found each other, but it seems that some petroleum-industry corporations based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], ailing from the oil crisis, yet wanting to take advantage of low real estate prices for the expansion of gas station networks, could no longer qualify as easily for bank financing as they could in the early part of the decade. Wealthy CD investors in the same area, no longer able to achieve high yields from banks, may have found a solution to both their needs and those of their oil-industry counterparts by inventing the clap note.\n\n==Current use==\nToday, the clap note still remains an exclusive investment vehicle for well-heeled investors. However, the actual origination of the instruments has shifted from the lender to the borrower, with servicing companies managing the payments to the investors on behalf of the borrowers. Companies that require ongoing expansion of their outlet networks still use this method to raise capital at times when real estate values drop. This includes gas station networks, fast food chains, drug store and pharmacy chains as well as muffler, transmission and brake repair workshops. The fact that clap notes are always backed by real estate makes them far more secure than most other investments that yield similar rates of return.\n\nIn many instances, the property being acquired is raw land or real estate that is scheduled to be condemned, and is therefore available at very low cost. Companies also time their real estate acquisitions when property values are generally on the decline. Although the property buyers are invariably AAA corporations, the nature of the property and the timing of the purchase vis-\u00e0-vis the prevailing interest rate cycle, makes these transactions unattractive to banks.\n\nClap note investors benefit from this situation, because the corporation has established a long-term plan for the property in which the 24 months of high interest is only a small component. Invariably the company has an exit strategy in mind for the property that includes [[refinancing]] in two years via buyer-assumable, low-interest [[Wall Street]] [[conduit loans]]. This allows them to pay off the clap note investors at full face value. During the two-year period, the company also completes all construction improvements on the property (gas station, fast food outlet, drug store or whatever).\n\nWith the clap notes now out of the way, the construction improvements done and having a low-interest conduit loan on the property that can be easily assumed by another buyer, the company can now move on to step three of their real estate strategy, which is usually a [[sale leaseback]], in which they sell the property to another real estate investor with themselves as the long-term lessee. Having a AAA lessee on the property in a long-term lease increases the value of the property dramatically beyond the value of the built improvements. Selling the property in a sale leaseback at this stage allows the corporation to have its cake and eat it too: they no longer own the property, but they have the site! Invariably, the new buyer can assume the low-interest conduit loan (a win for the buyer) while the equity payout that the company receives from the sale more than covers the cost of the construction and allows the new outlet to start business debt free with an operating capital buffer (a win for the company).\n\n==Future==\nAs more and more franchises appear on the scene, all in a desperate push to increase the number of outlets in their networks, it is likely that the demand for clap notes will increase, gradually making them available to new classes of smaller investors through [[investment club]]s and other avenues.\n\n[[Category:Commercial bonds]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Notability|Neologisms|date=February 2016}}\n}}\n\n'''Clap note''' is an unofficial shorthand term describing an interest-only financing tool used by certain institutional investors, such as major corporations for the purpose of funding new real-estate acquisitions.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe instrument is called a \u2018clap note\u2019 because it provides the same interest rate \u2018out of two different hands\u2019 (\u201cit takes two hands to clap\u201d).

Although they perform and have some good times together, they are rivals onstage and in their private lives. They also undergo intense scrutiny from the [[paparazzi]] and gossip press over their love lives and careers. The film was loosely inspired by the real life [[Three Tenors]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]].<ref name=Variety />\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a shot of a poster with three men in tuxedos under the name \"Los Tres Tenores\". Inside a theater in Mexico, one of the men, the dapper and refined French tenor Armand Dupres sings an operatic aria. Backstage, Spanish tenor Ricardo Palacios' wife tries to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her. Police take her away screaming, as Palacios and superstitious Italian tenor, Fabrizio Bernini, prepare to go onstage. Palacios hands his colleagues large Mexican [[sombreros]] and tells them to their disgust they must sing a [[mariachi]] number together. The concert turns into a disaster. A series of newspaper headlines follow their performance asking \"Tenors or Clowns?\" and explaining that his singing partners are suing Palacios for fraud. [[Paparazzi]] photographs follow showing Bernini kissing Palacios' wife and Dupres mourning his own wife's death.\n\nThe action shifts ten years forward as Dupres is preparing to marry Palacios' daughter. The Frenchman's butler is horrified and tries to sabotage the union. Bernini has also married Palacios' now ex-wife. The Italian tenor does not want to attend Dupres' wedding, but his wife wants to be there for her daughter. She chides him about his insecurity, as he questions her whether Palacios was a better lover. Palacios also plans to attend his daughter's wedding at Dupres' French villa, but he has additional schemes in mind. He hires a call girl to pose as his fianc\u00e9e to convince his former partners and ex-wife how well he is now doing. While learning facts about his life (e.g. he was born on a boat to Mexico), the call girl tries to seduce him but he refuses, saying that sex has gotten him into trouble in the past. Immediately, an irate chef confronts the tenor about sleeping with his daughter, whom he insists now has twins who sing constantly.\n\nOn the way to Dupres' villa, Bernini feels ill because of his phobia of air conditioning and germs. At the villa, his wife and Dupres are briefly alone together. She threatens to tell her daughter and he threatens to tell her husband that they too were once lovers. Dupres and Bernini speculate over why Palacios is really attending the wedding. Dupres suggests that the Spaniard is more concerned with money than anything else. Once he arrives, Palacios tells his former colleagues that he has discovered \"the new Three Tenors\", in a bid to get them to return to performing together instead. Later, while his wife is painting his greying eyebrows dark, Bernini theatrically exclaims that everyone wants to replace him. She chides him for thinking the world revolves around himself.\n\nThe following day, after Palacios sings a [[tango]], the tenors have an argument. Dupres and Bernini express disgust that Palacios got them to record duets with pop singers, dress as mariachis, and promote [[Pizza Hut]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], when what they do is art. Palacios avers that repeating the same compositions over and over for rich people is not art. It is more important to him that 1.5 billion people watched them perform on television.\n\nLater that day, Palacios hears a new composition by Dupres' son performed by three singing waiters. Telling the son that he has conducted modern music like his, he convinces them to perform the composition at a party on the eve of Dupres' wedding, claiming to his former partners that these were his three young discoveries. Once they hear them sing, the older tenors begin to sing together too. After the party, Bernini unsuccessfully tries to kill himself, despairing over his thirty-year rivalry with Palacios, while Dupres' fianc\u00e9e realizes she is actually in love with his son. The next day at the wedding Palacios, after bragging about his acting abilities in ''[[Otello]]'', pretends to have a heart attack in order to distract the paparazzi while his daughter and Dupres' son run away together. Soon afterwards, Bernini sings \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" at a Spanish opera house, while a poster with the title \"The 3 Tenors the Return\" is seen. Palacios comes out of his dressing room after a tryst with the call girl, and the three tenors go onstage to sing and dance the \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Ricardo Palacios\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Fabrizio Bernini\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Armand Dupres\n* [[Anna Galiena]] as Rita\n* [[Ariadna Gil]] as Carmen Palacios\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Violeta\n* [[Ashley Hamilton]] as Maurice Dupres\n* [[Geoffrey Bateman]] as Ivo\n* [[Tiffany Hofstetter]] as Norma\n* [[Vaughan Sivell]] as Flavio\n* [[Manuel de Blas]] as Jean Fran\u00e7ois \n* [[Ren\u00e9 Assa]]\tas Sigmund Santini \n* [[Jacques Herlin]] as Cardenal\n\n==Background==\nAround a decade before ''Off Key'' was filmed, the most famous operatic tenors in the world, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], appeared together in their first concert, the [[The Three Tenors in Concert|recording of which]] became the best-selling classical album of all time.<ref name=\"Malone2011\">{{cite book|author=Gareth Malone|title=Music for the People: The Pleasures and Pitfalls of Classical Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oydQ714j4w0C&pg=PA34|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=28 April 2011|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-739618-4|pages=34\u2013}}</ref><ref name=3Ts>Classical Music Magazine, volume 17, p. 39 (1994).</ref> More concerts, recordings, and a frenzy of publicity followed, including from the paparazzi and gossip books like ''[[The Private Lives of the Three Tenors]]''.

In the aria, the character Don Jos\u00e9 tries to convince the wild Gypsy Carmen (also the name of Palacios' daughter in the movie) of the depth of his love for her. Jos\u00e9 Carreras recorded the complete role under the renowned conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] in 1983, while Pl\u00e1cido Domingo starred in [[Carmen (1984 film)|a movie version]] of the opera in 1984.\n\nLater at the wedding party, the tenors sing the \"Brindisi\" (\"[[Libiamo ne' lieti calici]]\") from Verdi's ''[[La Traviata]]'' with Palacios' young discoveries. In the opera, the \"Brinidisi\" is also a toast sung at a party. The real Three Tenors, who always wore tuxedos in their joint concerts like their movie counterparts, performed this duet together as a trio many times.

Domingo, who also conducts, periodically accompanies himself on the piano while singing, as does Palacios with this song. The movie also features an original piece written by [[Bernardo Bonezzi]], which acts as Dupres' son's composition during the party scene.\n\n==Reception==\nThe reviewer for ''Variety'' was unimpressed by the movie's screwball comedy script and likened it to a series of underwhelming English-language films made by Spanish moviemakers.

Although they perform and have some good times together, they are rivals onstage and in their private lives. They also undergo intense scrutiny from the [[paparazzi]] and gossip press over their love lives and careers. The film was loosely inspired by the real life [[Three Tenors]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]].<ref name=Variety />\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a shot of a poster with three men in tuxedos under the name \"Los Tres Tenores\". Inside a theater in Mexico, one of the men, the dapper and refined French tenor Armand Dupres sings an operatic aria. Backstage, Spanish tenor Ricardo Palacios' wife tries to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her. Police take her away screaming, as Palacios and superstitious Italian tenor, Fabrizio Bernini, prepare to go onstage. Palacios hands his colleagues large Mexican [[sombreros]] and tells them to their disgust they must sing a [[mariachi]] number together. The concert turns into a disaster. A series of newspaper headlines follow their performance asking \"Tenors or Clowns?\" and explaining that his singing partners are suing Palacios for fraud. [[Paparazzi]] photographs follow showing Bernini kissing Palacios' wife and Dupres mourning his own wife's death.\n\nThe action shifts ten years forward as Dupres is preparing to marry Palacios' daughter. The Frenchman's butler is horrified and tries to sabotage the union. Bernini has also married Palacios' now ex-wife. The Italian tenor does not want to attend Dupres' wedding, but his wife wants to be there for her daughter. She chides him about his insecurity, as he questions her whether Palacios was a better lover. Palacios also plans to attend his daughter's wedding at Dupres' French villa, but he has additional schemes in mind. He hires a call girl to pose as his fianc\u00e9e to convince his former partners and ex-wife how well he is now doing. While learning facts about his life (e.g. he was born on a boat to Mexico), the call girl tries to seduce him but he refuses, saying that sex has gotten him into trouble in the past. Immediately, an irate chef confronts the tenor about sleeping with his daughter, whom he insists now has twins who sing constantly.\n\nOn the way to Dupres' villa, Bernini feels ill because of his phobia of air conditioning and germs. At the villa, his wife and Dupres are briefly alone together. She threatens to tell her daughter and he threatens to tell her husband that they too were once lovers. Dupres and Bernini speculate over why Palacios is really attending the wedding. Dupres suggests that the Spaniard is more concerned with money than anything else. Once he arrives, Palacios tells his former colleagues that he has discovered \"the new Three Tenors\", in a bid to get them to return to performing together instead. Later, while his wife is painting his greying eyebrows dark, Bernini theatrically exclaims that everyone wants to replace him. She chides him for thinking the world revolves around himself.\n\nThe following day, after Palacios sings a [[tango]], the tenors have an argument. Dupres and Bernini express disgust that Palacios got them to record duets with pop singers, dress as mariachis, and promote [[Pizza Hut]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], when what they do is art. Palacios avers that repeating the same compositions over and over for rich people is not art. It is more important to him that 1.5 billion people watched them perform on television.\n\nLater that day, Palacios hears a new composition by Dupres' son performed by three singing waiters. Telling the son that he has conducted modern music like his, he convinces them to perform the composition at a party on the eve of Dupres' wedding, claiming to his former partners that these were his three young discoveries. Once they hear them sing, the older tenors begin to sing together too. After the party, Bernini unsuccessfully tries to kill himself, despairing over his thirty-year rivalry with Palacios, while Dupres' fianc\u00e9e realizes she is actually in love with his son. The next day at the wedding Palacios, after bragging about his acting abilities in ''[[Otello]]'', pretends to have a heart attack in order to distract the paparazzi while his daughter and Dupres' son run away together. Soon afterwards, Bernini sings \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" at a Spanish opera house, while a poster with the title \"The 3 Tenors the Return\" is seen. Palacios comes out of his dressing room after a tryst with the call girl, and the three tenors go onstage to sing and dance the \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Ricardo Palacios\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Fabrizio Bernini\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Armand Dupres\n* [[Anna Galiena]] as Rita\n* [[Ariadna Gil]] as Carmen Palacios\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Violeta\n* [[Ashley Hamilton]] as Maurice Dupres\n* [[Geoffrey Bateman]] as Ivo\n* [[Tiffany Hofstetter]] as Norma\n* [[Vaughan Sivell]] as Flavio\n* [[Manuel de Blas]] as Jean Fran\u00e7ois \n* [[Ren\u00e9 Assa]]\tas Sigmund Santini \n* [[Jacques Herlin]] as Cardenal\n\n==Background==\nAround a decade before ''Off Key'' was filmed, the most famous operatic tenors in the world, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], appeared together in their first concert, the [[The Three Tenors in Concert|recording of which]] became the best-selling classical album of all time.<ref name=\"Malone2011\">{{cite book|author=Gareth Malone|title=Music for the People: The Pleasures and Pitfalls of Classical Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oydQ714j4w0C&pg=PA34|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=28 April 2011|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-739618-4|pages=34\u2013}}</ref><ref name=3Ts>Classical Music Magazine, volume 17, p. 39 (1994).</ref> More concerts, recordings, and a frenzy of publicity followed, including from the paparazzi and gossip books like ''[[The Private Lives of the Three Tenors]]''.
