Until then, during his coaching career, it became notorious that he would hire stricktly domestix players and release as many as foreign ones as he could. One of the reasons is clearly his lack of knolledge of foreign langueges, knowing only Serbian and Russian, thus being unable to communicate with players speaking other languages. Confronted with the issue during the inteview, he made an effort to put the blame on the foreign players, accusing them of indiscipline due to the fact that salaries were being receved late, however, curiously, all other coaches face same problems but still don\u00b4t have any conflicts with foreign players, unlike Lalatovic has, so seems clearly more as a cheap excuse. He follows to claim that has nothing against foreign players, it\u00b4s just that they \"need to be much more better then a domestic player\" in order for him to respect him equally as a domestic one.<ref>[https://www.fkvojvodina.rs/nenad-lalatovic-odgovarao-na-pitanja-vojvodinasa/?script=lat Nenad Lalatovi\u0107 odgovarao na pitanja vojvodina\u0161a] at fkvojvodina.rs, 10-7-2019, retrieved

Until then, during his coaching career, it became notorious that he would hire stricktly domestix players and release as many as foreign ones as he could. One of the reasons is clearly his lack of knolledge of foreign langueges, knowing only Serbian and Russian, thus being unable to communicate with players speaking other languages. Confronted with the issue during the inteview, he made an effort to put the blame on the foreign players, accusing them of indiscipline due to the fact that salaries were being receved late, however, curiously, all other coaches face same problems but still don\u00b4t have any conflicts with foreign players, unlike Lalatovic has, so seems clearly more as a cheap excuse. He follows to claim that has nothing against foreign players, it\u00b4s just that they \"need to be much more better then a domestic player\" in order for him to respect him.<ref>[https://www.fkvojvodina.rs/nenad-lalatovic-odgovarao-na-pitanja-vojvodinasa/?script=lat Nenad Lalatovi\u0107 odgovarao na pitanja vojvodina\u0161a] at fkvojvodina.rs, 10-7-2019, retrieved

He was the father of former [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] player [[Kevin Keen]].\n\nKeen started his career at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], making his debut in 1959 against [[York City F.C.|York City]]. He went on to play 393 league games and scored 39 goals for the club.\n\nKeen was the captain of the QPR side that won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Championship in [[1966-67 in English football|1966\u201367]]. He captained the [[The Football Association|FA]] tour of Australia in 1971. He scored 6 goals as they won all of their 9 games, 2 against [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and 7 against state sides. He played for [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] from 1969 to 1972 until he was transferred to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].\n\nHe was appointed player-manager of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in 1973. He was sacked in 1977 shortly before a home game with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], but was on the touchline during the game, which [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] won 2\u20130 despite having two players [[Misconduct (football)|sent off]].\n\nHe later moved into full-time management with [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], between 1978 and 1979, followed by his hometown club, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], between January 1980 and 1984, leading them to the semi-final of the [[FA Trophy]] in [[1981-82 in English football|1981\u201382]], then to the [[Isthmian League]] title in [[1982-83 in English football|1982\u201383]]. He went on to manage Marlow.\n\nKeen ran two sports shops in High Wycombe.

He gradually established control over the whole island and used political and military tactics to gain dominance over his rivals. Throughout his years in power, he worked to improve the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labour, negotiated trade treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States, and maintained a large and well-disciplined army.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.7-8\">Cauna, pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nAfter defeating leaders among the [[free people of color]], in 1801, he promulgated an autonomist constitution for the colony, which named him as [[President for Life|Governor-General for Life]]. In 1802 he was invited to a parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses and arrested. He was deported to France and jailed, dying of pneumonia in 1803. Suffering massive losses in multiple historic battles at the hands of the Haitian army and losing many men of their forces to [[yellow fever]], the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue that very year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant, Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General Toussaint Louverture, pictured here on a Haitian banknote]]\nFor years little was known for certain about Toussaint Louverture's early life, as there were contradictory accounts and evidence about his life before the advent of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest records of his life are his recorded remarks and the reminiscences of his second legitimate son, Isaac Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.57\u201358</ref> Toussaint Louverture's parents are not known. John Beard's biography of Louverture claims that family traditions name his grandfather as [[Gaou Guinou]], a son of the [[Great Ardra|King of Allada]]. Louverture was the eldest of several children.<ref>Beard, pp.23\u201324</ref> Pierre Baptiste Simon is usually considered to have been his godfather.<ref>Korngold, page number needed.</ref>\n\nLouverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Br\u00e9da at Haut de Cap in [[Saint-Domingue]], which was owned by the Comte de No\u00e9 and later managed by Bayon de Libertate.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360, 62</ref> His date of birth is uncertain, but his name suggests he was born on [[All Saints Day]], 1 November. He was probably about 50 at the start of the revolution in 1791.<ref>Bell, p.60</ref> Various sources have given birth dates between 1739 and 1746. Because of the lack of written records, Louverture may not have known his exact birth date.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360.</ref> In childhood, he earned the nickname ''Fatras-B\u00e2ton,'' suggesting he was small and weak, though he was to become known for his stamina and riding prowess.<ref>Beard, pp.26\u201327; Bell, p.60, 62</ref> An alternative explanation of Louverture's origins is that he was brought to Br\u00e9da by the new overseer Bayon de Libertate, who took up his duties in 1772.<ref>Bell, pp.66, 70, 72</ref>\n\n===Education===\nLouverture is believed to have been well educated by his godfather Pierre Baptiste, a [[free person of color]] who lived and worked on the Br\u00e9da plantation. Historians have speculated as to Louverture's intellectual background. His extant letters demonstrate a command of French in addition to [[Haitian Creole|Creole]]; and he reveals familiarity with [[Epictetus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] who had lived as a slave. His public speeches as well as his life's work, according to his biographers, show a familiarity with [[Machiavelli]].<ref name=\"Bell, p.61\">Bell, p.61</ref> Some cite [[Abb\u00e9 Raynal]], who wrote against slavery, as a possible influence:<ref>Bell, p.61; Beard, pp.30\u201336</ref> The wording of the proclamation issued by then rebel slave leader Louverture on 29 August 1793, which may have been the first time he publicly used the name \"Louverture\", seems to refer to an anti-slavery passage in Abb\u00e9 Raynal's \"A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies.\"<ref>Bell, p.18</ref><ref>Robin Blackburn. ''The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery 1776\u20131848''. New York: Verso, 2000, p.54.</ref>\n\nHe may also have received some education from [[Jesuit]] missionaries. His medical knowledge is attributed to familiarity with African or Creole herbal-medical techniques, as well techniques commonly found in Jesuit-administered hospitals.<ref>Bell, pp. 64\u201365</ref> A few legal documents signed on Louverture's behalf between 1778 and 1781 suggest that he could not write at that time.<ref>Cauna, pp.61\u201367; Bell, pp.60, 80</ref> Throughout his military and political career, he used secretaries to prepare most of his correspondence. A few surviving documents in his own hand confirm that he could write, although his spelling in the French language was \"strictly phonetic.\"<ref>Bell, p.61; James, p.104</ref> That is not to suggest, however, that Louverture did not have a complex understanding of diplomacy; even lacking formal education, his correspondence with France during the Haitian Revolution beyond proved a high level of intellectual competence.<ref>Dr. Brenda Elsey, personal communication, March, 2020.</ref> At the expense of many potential intellectuals, the rapacious slave trade system often prevented many from seeing their in-built aptitudes come to full fruition; \"Although the African Black populations were typically illiterate, this does not mean they were unintelligent. Rather, they had been educated in skills, crafts, and traditions which were often lost during centuries of slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Ralph|date=1997-12-22|title=The Laws of Ignorance Designed to Keep Slaves (Blacks) Illiterate and Powerless|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-20479492/the-laws-of-ignorance-designed-to-keep-slaves-blacks|journal=Education|volume=118|issue=2|pages=206|issn=0013-1172}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage and children===\n[[File:19th century engraving of L'Ouverture.JPG|thumb|upright|19th century engraving of Louverture]]\nIn 1782, Louverture married [[Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture|Suzanne Simone Baptiste]], who is thought to have been his cousin or the daughter of his godfather.<ref>Cauna, p.263</ref> Toward the end of his life, he told General [[Marie-Fran\u00e7ois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga|Caffarelli]] that he had fathered 16 children with multiple women, of whom 11 had predeceased him.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\">Cauna, pp.264\u2013267</ref> Not all his children can be identified for certain, but his three legitimate sons are well known.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The eldest, Placide, was probably adopted by Louverture and is generally thought to have been Suzanne's first child, fathered by Seraphim Le Clerc, a mulatto.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The two sons born of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/>\n\n=== Slavery, freedom and working life ===\n<blockquote>\"I was born a slave, but nature gave me the soul of a free man.\"<ref>Parkinson, p.37</ref></blockquote>\n\nUntil 1938, historians believed that Louverture had been a slave until the start of the revolution.<ref>Up to, for example, [[C.L.R. James]], writing in 1938</ref> In the later 20th century, discovery of a marriage certificate dated 1777 documents that he was freed in 1776 at the age of 33. This find retrospectively clarified a letter of 1797, in which he said he had been free for twenty years.<ref>Cauna, pp. 62\u201362</ref> He appeared to have an important role on the Br\u00e9da plantation until the outbreak of the revolution, presumably as a salaried employee who contributed to the daily functions of the plantation.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\">Bell, pp. 24\u201325</ref> He had initially been responsible for the [[livestock]].<ref>Bell, p.62</ref> By 1791, his responsibilities most likely included acting as coachman to the overseer, de Libertat, and as a slave-driver, charged with organising the work force.<ref>Bell, p.76,</ref>\n\nAs a free man, Louverture began to accumulate wealth and property. Surviving legal documents show him renting a small coffee plantation that was worked by a dozen of his own slaves.<ref>Cauna, pp.63\u201365</ref> He would later say that by the start of the revolution, he had acquired a reasonable fortune, and was the owner of a number of properties and slaves at Ennery.<ref>Bell, pp.72\u201373</ref>\n\nLouverture's life philosophy, as a revolutionary spirit, not only incited widespread recognition of autonomy among his enslaved counterparts but evoked a collective sense of worry among colonialist nations, such as Great Britain, which feared the slave revolt and ideology would spread to other slave societies in the Caribbean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Meade|first=Teresa|title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781118772485|location=John Wiley & Sons Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|pages=68}}</ref> In light of the given circumstance, \"England found the French army preferable to the enlightened to Toussaint Louverture, while the United States, only just free of its own colonial oppression, opted to ally with the colonial powers of England and France rather than to give aid to Saint-Dominques's anti-colonial struggle.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\nThroughout his life, Louverture was known as a devout [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>Bell, p.194</ref> After defeating forces led by [[Andre Rigaud]] in the [[War of the Knives]], Louverture consolidated his power by decreeing a new constitution for the colony in 1801. It established Catholicism as the official religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/haiti/1801/constitution.htm |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Although [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] was generally practiced on Saint-Domingue in combination with Catholicism, little is known for certain if Louverture had any connection with it. Officially as ruler of Saint-Domingue, he discouraged it.<ref>Bell, pp.56, 196</ref>\n\nHistorians have suggested that he was a member of high degree of the [[Masonic Lodge]] of Saint-Domingue, mostly based on a Masonic symbol he used in his signature. The membership of several free blacks and white men close to him has been confirmed.<ref>Bell, p.63</ref> His membership is, considering his status as a devout Catholic, nonetheless unlikely due to the papal ban on Catholics holding membership in Masonic organizations introduced by Pope Clement XII having gone into effect in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clement XII |first1=Pope |title=In Eminenti |url=https://www.papalencyclicals.net/clem12/c12inemengl.htm |website=papalenciclicals.net |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Haitian Revolution==\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791\u20131804) was a [[slave revolt]] in the [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]], which culminated in the elimination of [[slavery]] there and established the [[Republic of Haiti]]. It was the only slave revolt in the modern era that led to the founding of a [[Sovereign state|state]]. It is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred in the Americas.\n\n===The Rebellion: 1791\u20131794===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|right|Toussaint Louverture, as depicted in an 1802 French engraving]]\n\nBeginning in 1789, [[free people of color]] of Saint-Domingue were inspired by the [[French Revolution]] to seek an expansion of their rights and equality, while perpetuating the denial of freedom and rights to the slaves, who made up the overwhelming majority of population on the island. Initially, the slave population did not become involved in the conflict.<ref>Bell, pp.12\u201315; James, pp.81\u201382</ref> In August 1791, a Vodou ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] marked the start of a [[St. Domingue Slave Revolt|major slave rebellion]] in the north, which had the largest plantations and masses of slaves. Louverture apparently did not take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, but after a few weeks he sent his family to safety in Spanish [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] and helped the overseers of the Breda plantation to leave the island. He joined the forces of [[Georges Biassou]] as doctor to the troops, commanding a small detachment.<ref>James, p.90; Bell, pp.23\u201324</ref> Surviving documents show him participating in the leadership of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for supplies.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\"/>\n\nIn December 1791, he was involved in negotiations between rebel leaders and the French Governor, [[Philibert Fran\u00e7ois Rouxel de Blanchelande|Blanchelande]], for the release of their white prisoners and a return to work in exchange for a ban on the use of the whip, an extra non-working day per week, and freedom for a handful of leaders.<ref>Bell, p.32-33</ref> When the offer was rejected, he was instrumental in preventing the massacre of Biassou's white prisoners.<ref>Bell, p.33</ref> The prisoners were released after further negotiations with the French commissioners and taken to [[Le Cap]] by Louverture. He hoped to use the occasion to present the rebellion's demands to the colonial assembly, but they refused to meet with him.<ref>Bell, pp.34\u201335</ref>\n\nThroughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the ''Cordon de l'Ouest,'' a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory.<ref>Bell, pp.42\u201350</ref> He gained a reputation for running an orderly camp, trained his men in [[guerrilla]] tactics and \"the European style of war\",<ref>Bell, pp.46</ref> and began to attract soldiers who would play an important role throughout the revolution.<ref>Bell, pp.28, 55</ref> After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General [[\u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux]], but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader.<ref>Bell, p.50</ref>\n\nSome time in 1792\u201393, he adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for \"opening\" or \"the one who opened the way\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Lester|title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution: 1750-1850|url=https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang/page/111 111]}}</ref> Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in \"L'Ouverture\", he did not, as his extant correspondence indicates. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel's exclamation: \"That man makes an opening everywhere\". However, some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth.<ref>Bell, p.56</ref>\n\nDespite adhering to royalist political views, Louverture had begun to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution.<ref>James, pp.125\u2013126</ref> From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition.<ref>Bell, pp.86\u201387; James, p.107</ref> \n\nOn 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St Domingue:\n<blockquote>Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.<br /><br />Your very humble and obedient servant, Toussaint Louverture,<br /><br />General of the armies of the king, for the public good.<ref>Bell, p.18</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture Signature.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Toussaint Louverture's signature]]\n\nOn the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]], proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue,<ref>Bell, p.19</ref> hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.<ref>James, pp.128\u2013130</ref> Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.<ref>James, p.137</ref> However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, pp.141\u2013142</ref> For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general \u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux. During this time, competition between him and other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.<ref>Bell, pp.92\u201395</ref> In May 1794, when the decision of the French government became known in Saint-Domingue, Louverture switched allegiance from the Spanish to the French and rallied his troops to Laveaux.<ref>James pp.143\u2013144</ref>\n\n===Alliance with the French: 1794\u20131796===\n{{Slavery}}\nAfter months of skillful maneuvering that kept him on nominally good terms with the Spanish, while he also had secret correspondence with the new revolutionary French colonial government, Louverture officially joined the French in early May 1794, raising the republican flag over the port of [[Gona\u00efves]]. This provoked an exodus of refugees, both whites and free people of color, with many taking slaves with them.  In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the Cordon de l'Ouest, which he had held on their behalf.<ref>Bell, pp.104\u2013108</ref> \n\nHe faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the black slave rebellion were now fighting against him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was under attack from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the instability and gain control of the wealthy sugar-producing island.<ref>Bell, p.109</ref> On the other hand, he was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux's troops in joint actions.<ref>James, p.143</ref> By now his officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew [[Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse|Mo\u00efse]], [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], and [[Henri Christophe]].<ref>James, p.147</ref>\n\nBefore long, Louverture had put an end to the Spanish threat to French Saint-Domingue. In any case, the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] of July 1795 marked a formal end to hostilities between the two countries. Black leaders [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Biassou]] continued to fight against Louverture until November, when they left for Spain and Florida, respectively. At that point, most of their men joined Louverture's forces.<ref>Bell, p.115</ref> Louverture also made inroads against the British troops, but was unable to oust them from [[Saint-Marc]]. He contained them and rendered them ineffective by returning to guerilla tactics.<ref>Bell, pp.110\u2013114</ref>\n\nThroughout 1795 and 1796, Louverture was also concerned with re-establishing agriculture and exports, and keeping the peace in areas under his control. In speeches and policy he revealed his belief that the long-term freedom of the people of Saint-Domingue depended on the economic viability of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.113, 126</ref> He was held in general respect, and resorted to a mixture of diplomacy and force to return the field hands to the plantations as emancipated and paid workers.<ref>James, pp.155\u2013156</ref> Workers regularly created small rebellions, protesting poor conditions, their lack of real freedom, or fearing a return to slavery. They wanted to establish their own small holdings and work for themselves, rather than on plantations.<ref>James, pp.152\u2013154</ref>\n\nAnother of Louverture's concerns was to manage potential rivals for power within the French part of the colony. The most serious of these was the [[mulatto]] commander [[Jean-Louis Villatte]], based in [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]]. Louverture and Villate had competed over the command of some sections of troops and territory since 1794. Villatte was thought to be somewhat racist towards black soldiers such as Louverture and planned to ally with [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of colour, after overthrowing French General \u00c9tienne Laveaux.<ref>Laurent Dubois and John Garrigus, ''Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, 1789\u20131804: A Brief History with Documents''. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p.31</ref> In 1796 Villate drummed up popular support by accusing the French authorities of plotting a return to slavery. \n\nOn 20 March, he succeeded in capturing the French Governor Laveaux, and appointed himself Governor. Louverture's troops soon arrived at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to rescue the captured governor and drive Villatte out of town. Louverture was noted for opening the warehouses to the public, proving that they were empty of the chains that residents feared had been imported to prepare for a return to slavery. He was promoted to commander of the West Province two months later, and in 1797 was appointed as Saint-Domingue's top-ranking officer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\">Dubois and Garrigus, p.31</ref> Laveaux proclaimed Louverture as Lieutenant Governor, announcing at the same time that he would do nothing without his approval, to which Louverture replied, \"After God, Laveaux\".<ref>Bell, pp.132\u2013134; James, pp.163\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Third Commission: 1796\u201397===\nA few weeks after Louverture's triumph over the Villate insurrection, France's representatives of the third commission arrived in Saint-Domingue. Among them was [[Sonthonax]], the commissioner who had previously declared abolition of slavery on the same day as Louverture's proclamation of Camp Turel.<ref>Bell, p.136</ref> At first the relationship between the two men was positive. Sonthonax promoted Louverture to general and arranged for his sons, Placide and Isaac, to attend the school that had been established in France for the children of colonials.<ref>Bell, pp.137, 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nIn September 1796, elections were held to choose colonial representatives for the French national assembly. Louverture's letters show that he encouraged Laveaux to stand, and historians have speculated as to whether he was seeking to place a firm supporter in France or to remove a rival in power.<ref>Bell, pp.147\u2013148</ref> Sonthonax was also elected, either at Louverture's instigation or on his own initiative. While Laveaux left Saint-Domingue in October, Sonthonax remained.<ref>Bell, p.145, James, p.180</ref>\n\nSonthonax, a fervent revolutionary and fierce supporter of racial equality, soon rivalled Louverture in popularity. Although their goals were similar, they had several points of conflict.<ref>James, pp.174\u2013176; Bell, pp. 141\u2013142, 147</ref> They strongly disagreed about accepting the return of the white planters who had fled Saint-Domingue at the start of the revolution. To Sonthonax, they were potential counter-revolutionaries, to be assimilated, officially or not, with the \u2018[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]\u2019 who had fled the French Revolution and were forbidden to return under pain of death. To Louverture, they were bearers of useful skills and knowledge, and he wanted them back.<ref>Bell, pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nIn summer 1797, Louverture authorised the return of Bayon de Libertat, the ex-overseer of Br\u00e9da, with whom he had a lifelong relationship. Sonthonax wrote to Louverture threatening him with prosecution and ordering him to get Bayon off the island. Louverture went over his head and wrote to the French [[Directoire]] directly for permission for Bayon to stay.<ref>Bell, p.150</ref> Only a few weeks later, he began arranging for Sonthonax's return to France that summer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\"/> Louverture had several reasons to want to get rid of Sonthonax; officially he said that Sonthonax had tried to involve him in a plot to make Saint-Domingue independent, starting with a massacre of the whites of the island.<ref>Bell, pp.150\u2013153</ref> The accusation played on Sonthonax's political radicalism and known hatred of the aristocratic white planters, but historians have varied as to how credible they consider it.<ref>James, pp.190, Bell, pp.153\u2013154</ref>\n\nOn reaching France, Sonthonax countered by accusing Louverture of royalist, counter-revolutionary, and pro-independence tendencies.<ref>Bell, p.153</ref> Louverture knew that he had asserted his authority to such an extent that the French government might well suspect him of seeking independence.<ref>Bell, pp.153, 155</ref> At the same time, the French Directoire government was considerably less revolutionary than it had been. Suspicions began to brew that it might reconsider the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, p.179</ref> In November 1797, Louverture wrote again to the Directoire, assuring them of his loyalty but reminding them firmly that abolition must be maintained.<ref>Bell, p.155</ref>\n\n===Treaties with Britain and the United States: 1798===\n[[File:Maitland and Louverture.jpg|thumb|right|''General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] meets Louverture to discuss the secret treaty'']]\nFor several months, Louverture was in sole command of French Saint-Domingue, except for a semi-autonomous state in the south, where  general [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of color, had rejected the authority of the third commission.<ref>Bell, pp.142\u2013143</ref> Both generals continued attacking the British, whose position on Saint-Domingue was looking increasingly weak.<ref>James, p.201</ref> Louverture was negotiating their withdrawal when France's latest commissioner, [[Comte d'H\u00e9douville|Gabriel H\u00e9douville]], arrived in March 1798, with orders to undermine his authority.<ref>James, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 1798, Louverture signed a treaty with the British general, [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], exchanging the withdrawal of British troops from western Saint-Domingue for an amnesty for the French counter-revolutionaries in those areas. In May, [[Port-au-Prince]] was returned to French rule in an atmosphere of order and celebration.<ref>James, pp.202, 204</ref>\n\nIn July, Louverture and Rigaud met commissioner H\u00e9douville together. Hoping to create a rivalry that would diminish Louverture's power, H\u00e9douville displayed a strong preference for Rigaud, and an aversion to Louverture.<ref>James, pp.207\u2013208</ref> However, General Maitland was also playing on French rivalries and evaded H\u00e9douville's authority to deal with Louverture directly.<ref>James, pp.211\u2013212</ref> In August, Louverture and Maitland signed treaties for the evacuation of the remaining British troops. On 31 August, they signed a secret treaty which lifted the British blockade on Saint-Domingue in exchange for a promise that Louverture would not export the black revolution to the British colony of [[Jamaica]], which also used slaves to produce sugar.<ref>Bell, pp.159\u2013160</ref>\n\nAs Louverture's relationship with H\u00e9douville reached the breaking point, an uprising began among the troops of his adopted nephew, Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse. Attempts by H\u00e9douville to manage the situation made matters worse and Louverture declined to help him. As the rebellion grew to a full-scale insurrection, H\u00e9douville prepared to leave the island, while Louverture and Dessalines threatened to arrest him as a troublemaker.<ref>James, pp.219\u2013220</ref> H\u00e9douville sailed for France in October 1798, nominally transferring his authority to Rigaud. Louverture decided instead to work with Phillipe Roume, a member of the third commission who had been posted to the Spanish parts of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.165\u2013166</ref> Though Louverture continued to protest his loyalty to the French government, he had expelled a second government representative from the territory and was about to negotiate another autonomous agreement with one of France's enemies.<ref>Bell, pp.166\u2013167</ref>\n\nThe United States had suspended trade with France in 1798 because of increasing conflict over piracy. The two countries were almost at war, but trade between Saint-Domingue and the United States was desirable to both Louverture and the United States. With H\u00e9douville gone, Louverture sent [[Joseph Bunel]] to negotiate with the government of [[John Adams]]. The terms of the treaty were similar to those already established with the British, but Louverture continually resisted suggestions from either power that he should declare independence.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Black Talleyrand: Toussaint L'Ouverture's Secret Diplomacy with England and the United States\", ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 66:1 (Jan. 2009), 87\u2013124.</ref> As long as France maintained the abolition of slavery, he appeared to be content to have the colony remain French, at least in name.<ref>Bell, pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Expansion of territory: 1799\u20131801===\n\nIn 1799, the tensions between Louverture and [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]] came to a head. Louverture accused Rigaud of trying to assassinate him to gain power over Saint-Domingue for himself. Rigaud claimed Louverture was conspiring with the British to restore slavery.<ref>Bell, pp.174\u2013175</ref> The conflict was complicated by racial overtones which escalated tension between blacks and mulattoes.<ref>Bell, pp.175\u2013177, 178\u2013179; James, pp.229\u2013230</ref> Louverture had other political reasons for bringing down Rigaud. Only by controlling every port could he hope to prevent a landing of French troops if necessary.<ref>James, pp.224, 237</ref>\n\nAfter Rigaud sent troops to seize the border towns of [[Petit-Goave]] and [[Grand-Goave]] in June 1799, Louverture persuaded Roume to declare Rigaud a traitor and attacked the southern state.<ref>Bell, p.177</ref> The resulting civil war, known as the [[War of Knives]], lasted over a year, with the defeated Rigaud fleeing to [[Guadeloupe]], then France, in August 1800.<ref>Bell, pp.182\u2013185</ref> Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who became infamous, during and after the war, for massacring mulatto captives and civilians.<ref>Bell, pp.179\u2013180</ref> The number of deaths is contested: the contemporary French general Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while the 20th-century [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] historian [[C.L.R. James]] later claimed there were only a few hundred deaths in contravention of the amnesty.<ref>James, p.236-237</ref>\n\nIn November 1799, during the civil war, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France and passed a new constitution declaring that the colonies would be subject to special laws.<ref>Bell, p.180</ref> Although the colonies suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture's position and promising to maintain abolition.<ref>Bell, p.184</ref> But he also forbade Louverture to invade Spanish Santo Domingo, an action that would put Louverture in a powerful defensive position.<ref>Bell, p.186</ref> Louverture was determined to proceed anyway and coerced Roume into supplying the necessary permission.<ref>Bell, pp.180\u2013182, 187</ref> \n\nIn January 1801, Louverture and Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse invaded the Spanish territory, taking possession from the Governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area had been less developed and less densely populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, which abolished slavery, and embarked on a program of modernization. He was now master of the whole island.<ref>Bell, pp.189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Constitution of 1801===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture engraving.jpg|thumb|An early engraving of Louverture]]\nNapoleon had informed the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue that France would draw up a new constitution for its colonies, in which they would be subjected to special laws.<ref>Alexis, Stephen. ''Black Liberator.'' London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1949, p.165</ref> Despite his initial protestations to the contrary, the former slaves feared that he might restore slavery. In March 1801, Louverture appointed a constitutional assembly, composed chiefly of white planters, to draft a constitution for Saint-Domingue. He promulgated the Constitution on 7 July 1801, officially establishing his authority over the ''entire'' island of [[Hispaniola]]. It made him Governor-General for Life with near absolute powers and the possibility of choosing his successor. However, Louverture was not to explicitly declare Saint-Domingue's independence, acknowledging in Article 1 that it was a single colony of the French Empire.<ref>\"Constitution de la colonie fran\u00e7ais de Saint-Domingue\", Le Cap, 1801</ref>\nArticle 3 of the constitution states: \"There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.140</ref> The constitution guaranteed equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law for all races, but also confirmed Louverture's policies of forced labour and the importation of workers through the slave trade.<ref>Bell, pp.210\u2013211</ref> Louverture was not willing to compromise [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] for Vodou, the dominant faith among former slaves. Article 6 states that \"the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith shall be the only publicly professed faith.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.141</ref>\n\nLouverture charged Colonel [[Charles Humbert Marie Vincent|Vincent]] with the task of presenting the new constitution to Napoleon, although Vincent was horrified to learn that the general had gone so far. Several aspects of the constitution were damaging to France: the absence of provision for French government officials, the lack of advantages to France in trade with its own colony, and Louverture's breach of protocol in publishing the constitution before submitting it to the French government. Despite his disapproval, Vincent attempted to submit the constitution to Napoleon in a positive light, but was briefly exiled to Elba for his pains.<ref>Philippe Girard, ''The Slaves Who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Haitian War of Independence'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, November 2011).</ref>\n\nLouverture identified as a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty. He wrote to Napoleon but received no reply.<ref>James, p.263</ref> Napoleon eventually decided to send an expedition of 20,000 men to Saint-Domingue to restore French authority, and possibly to restore slavery as well.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and the Emancipation Issue in Saint-Domingue, 1799\u20131803,\" ''French Historical Studies'' 32:4 (Fall 2009), 587\u2013618.</ref> Given the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (March 1802-May 1803) with Great Britain, Napoleon was suddenly able to plan this operation without the risk of interception by the [[Royal Navy]].\n\n===Leclerc's campaign===\n\nNapoleon's troops, under the command of his brother-in-law, General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Emmanuel Leclerc]], were directed to seize control of the island by diplomatic means, proclaiming peaceful intentions, and keep secret his orders to deport all black officers.<ref>James, pp.292\u2013294, Bell, pp.223\u2013224</ref> Meanwhile, Louverture was preparing for defence and ensuring discipline. This may have contributed to a rebellion against forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Mo\u00efse, in October 1801. Because the activism was violently repressed, when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue was automatically on Louverture's side.<ref>Bell, pp.206\u2013209, 226\u2013229, 250</ref> In late January 1802, while Leclerc sought permission to land at [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] and Christophe held him off, the Vicomte de [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] suddenly attacked [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]], effectively quashing the diplomatic option.<ref>Bell, pp.232\u2013234</ref>\n\nLouverture's plan in case of war was to burn the coastal cities and as much of the plains as possible, retreat with his troops into the inaccessible mountains, and wait for [[yellow fever]], which flourished on a seasonal basis, to decimate the European troops.<ref>Bell, pp.234\u2013236</ref> The biggest impediment to this plan proved to be difficulty in internal communications. Christophe burned Cap-Fran\u00e7ais and retreated, but Paul Louverture was tricked by a false letter into allowing the French to occupy Santo Domingo; other officers believed Napoleon's diplomatic proclamation, while some attempted resistance instead of burning and retreating.<ref>Bell, pp.234, 236\u2013237</ref> French reports to Napoleon show that in the months of fighting that followed, the French felt their position was weak, but that Louverture and his generals did not fully realize their strength.<ref>Bell, p.256-260</ref>\n\nWith both sides shocked by the violence of the initial fighting, Leclerc tried belatedly to revert to the diplomatic solution. Louverture's sons and their tutor had been sent from France to accompany the expedition with this end in mind and were now sent to present Napoleon's proclamation to Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.237\u2013241</ref> When these talks broke down, months of inconclusive fighting followed. On 6 May 1802, Louverture rode into Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to treat with Leclerc. He negotiated an amnesty for all his remaining generals, then retired with full honors to his plantations at [[Ennery, Artibonite|Ennery]].<ref>Bell, pp.261\u2013262</ref>\n\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ann Whitney, Toussaint Louverture, plaster, 1870.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Toussaint L'Ouverture'', 1870]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] was at least partially responsible for Louverture's arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture's son Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture's conduct as \"extraordinary.\" For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girard|first1=Philippe R.|title=Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2012|volume=69|issue=3|page=559|url=http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Girard2012 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|quote=a list of \u201cextraordinary expenses incurred by General Brunet in regards to [the arrest of] Toussaint\u201d started with \u201cgifts in wine and liquor, gifts to Dessalines and his spouse, money to his officers: 4000 francs.\u201d|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0549|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125421/http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLeclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]] was ordered to do so, but accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One version said that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in [[Saint-Domingue]] and was asking Louverture's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs, however, suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him.

He gradually established control over the whole island and used political and military tactics to gain dominance over his rivals. Throughout his years in power, he worked to improve the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labour, negotiated trade treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States, and maintained a large and well-disciplined army.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.7-8\">Cauna, pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nAfter defeating leaders among the [[free people of color]], in 1801, he promulgated an autonomist constitution for the colony, which named him as [[President for Life|Governor-General for Life]]. In 1802 he was invited to a parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses and arrested. He was deported to France and jailed, dying of pneumonia in 1803. Suffering massive losses in multiple historic battles at the hands of the Haitian army and losing many men of their forces to [[yellow fever]], the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue that very year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant, Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General Toussaint Louverture, pictured here on a Haitian banknote]]\nFor years little was known for certain about Toussaint Louverture's early life, as there were contradictory accounts and evidence about his life before the advent of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest records of his life are his recorded remarks and the reminiscences of his second legitimate son, Isaac Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.57\u201358</ref> Toussaint Louverture's parents are not known. John Beard's biography of Louverture claims that family traditions name his grandfather as [[Gaou Guinou]], a son of the [[Great Ardra|King of Allada]]. Louverture was the eldest of several children.<ref>Beard, pp.23\u201324</ref> Pierre Baptiste Simon is usually considered to have been his godfather.<ref>Korngold, page number needed.</ref>\n\nLouverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Br\u00e9da at Haut de Cap in [[Saint-Domingue]], which was owned by the Comte de No\u00e9 and later managed by Bayon de Libertate.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360, 62</ref> His date of birth is uncertain, but his name suggests he was born on [[All Saints Day]], 1 November. He was probably about 50 at the start of the revolution in 1791.<ref>Bell, p.60</ref> Various sources have given birth dates between 1739 and 1746. Because of the lack of written records, Louverture may not have known his exact birth date.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360.</ref> In childhood, he earned the nickname ''Fatras-B\u00e2ton,'' suggesting he was small and weak, though he was to become known for his stamina and riding prowess.<ref>Beard, pp.26\u201327; Bell, p.60, 62</ref> An alternative explanation of Louverture's origins is that he was brought to Br\u00e9da by the new overseer Bayon de Libertate, who took up his duties in 1772.<ref>Bell, pp.66, 70, 72</ref>\n\n===Education===\nLouverture is believed to have been well educated by his godfather Pierre Baptiste, a [[free person of color]] who lived and worked on the Br\u00e9da plantation. Historians have speculated as to Louverture's intellectual background. His extant letters demonstrate a command of French in addition to [[Haitian Creole|Creole]]; and he reveals familiarity with [[Epictetus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] who had lived as a slave. His public speeches as well as his life's work, according to his biographers, show a familiarity with [[Machiavelli]].<ref name=\"Bell, p.61\">Bell, p.61</ref> Some cite [[Abb\u00e9 Raynal]], who wrote against slavery, as a possible influence:<ref>Bell, p.61; Beard, pp.30\u201336</ref> The wording of the proclamation issued by then rebel slave leader Louverture on 29 August 1793, which may have been the first time he publicly used the name \"Louverture\", seems to refer to an anti-slavery passage in Abb\u00e9 Raynal's \"A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies.\"<ref>Bell, p.18</ref><ref>Robin Blackburn. ''The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery 1776\u20131848''. New York: Verso, 2000, p.54.</ref>\n\nHe may also have received some education from [[Jesuit]] missionaries. His medical knowledge is attributed to familiarity with African or Creole herbal-medical techniques, as well techniques commonly found in Jesuit-administered hospitals.<ref>Bell, pp. 64\u201365</ref> A few legal documents signed on Louverture's behalf between 1778 and 1781 suggest that he could not write at that time.<ref>Cauna, pp.61\u201367; Bell, pp.60, 80</ref> Throughout his military and political career, he used secretaries to prepare most of his correspondence. A few surviving documents in his own hand confirm that he could write, although his spelling in the French language was \"strictly phonetic.\"<ref>Bell, p.61; James, p.104</ref> That is not to suggest, however, that Louverture did not have a complex understanding of diplomacy; even lacking formal education, his correspondence with France during the Haitian Revolution beyond proved a high level of intellectual competence.<ref>Dr. Brenda Elsey, personal communication, March, 2020.</ref> At the expense of many potential intellectuals, the rapacious slave trade system often prevented many from seeing their in-built aptitudes come to full fruition; \"Although the African Black populations were typically illiterate, this does not mean they were unintelligent. Rather, they had been educated in skills, crafts, and traditions which were often lost during centuries of slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Ralph|date=1997-12-22|title=The Laws of Ignorance Designed to Keep Slaves (Blacks) Illiterate and Powerless|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-20479492/the-laws-of-ignorance-designed-to-keep-slaves-blacks|journal=Education|volume=118|issue=2|pages=206|issn=0013-1172}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage and children===\n[[File:19th century engraving of L'Ouverture.JPG|thumb|upright|19th century engraving of Louverture]]\nIn 1782, Louverture married [[Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture|Suzanne Simone Baptiste]], who is thought to have been his cousin or the daughter of his godfather.<ref>Cauna, p.263</ref> Toward the end of his life, he told General [[Marie-Fran\u00e7ois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga|Caffarelli]] that he had fathered 16 children with multiple women, of whom 11 had predeceased him.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\">Cauna, pp.264\u2013267</ref> Not all his children can be identified for certain, but his three legitimate sons are well known.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The eldest, Placide, was probably adopted by Louverture and is generally thought to have been Suzanne's first child, fathered by Seraphim Le Clerc, a mulatto.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The two sons born of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/>\n\n=== Slavery, freedom and working life ===\n<blockquote>\"I was born a slave, but nature gave me the soul of a free man.\"<ref>Parkinson, p.37</ref></blockquote>\n\nUntil 1938, historians believed that Louverture had been a slave until the start of the revolution.<ref>Up to, for example, [[C.L.R. James]], writing in 1938</ref> In the later 20th century, discovery of a marriage certificate dated 1777 documents that he was freed in 1776 at the age of 33. This find retrospectively clarified a letter of 1797, in which he said he had been free for twenty years.<ref>Cauna, pp. 62\u201362</ref> He appeared to have an important role on the Br\u00e9da plantation until the outbreak of the revolution, presumably as a salaried employee who contributed to the daily functions of the plantation.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\">Bell, pp. 24\u201325</ref> He had initially been responsible for the [[livestock]].<ref>Bell, p.62</ref> By 1791, his responsibilities most likely included acting as coachman to the overseer, de Libertat, and as a slave-driver, charged with organising the work force.<ref>Bell, p.76,</ref>\n\nAs a free man, Louverture began to accumulate wealth and property. Surviving legal documents show him renting a small coffee plantation that was worked by a dozen of his own slaves.<ref>Cauna, pp.63\u201365</ref> He would later say that by the start of the revolution, he had acquired a reasonable fortune, and was the owner of a number of properties and slaves at Ennery.<ref>Bell, pp.72\u201373</ref>\n\nLouverture's life philosophy, as a revolutionary spirit, not only incited widespread recognition of autonomy among his enslaved counterparts but evoked a collective sense of worry among colonialist nations, such as Great Britain, which feared the slave revolt and ideology would spread to other slave societies in the Caribbean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Meade|first=Teresa|title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781118772485|location=John Wiley & Sons Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|pages=68}}</ref> In light of the given circumstance, \"England found the French army preferable to the enlightened to Toussaint L'Ouverture, while the United States, only just free of its own colonial oppression, opted to ally with the colonial powers of England and France rather than to give aid to Saint-Dominques's anti-colonial struggle.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\nThroughout his life, Louverture was known as a devout [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>Bell, p.194</ref> After defeating forces led by [[Andre Rigaud]] in the [[War of the Knives]], Louverture consolidated his power by decreeing a new constitution for the colony in 1801. It established Catholicism as the official religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/haiti/1801/constitution.htm |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Although [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] was generally practiced on Saint-Domingue in combination with Catholicism, little is known for certain if Louverture had any connection with it. Officially as ruler of Saint-Domingue, he discouraged it.<ref>Bell, pp.56, 196</ref>\n\nHistorians have suggested that he was a member of high degree of the [[Masonic Lodge]] of Saint-Domingue, mostly based on a Masonic symbol he used in his signature. The membership of several free blacks and white men close to him has been confirmed.<ref>Bell, p.63</ref> His membership is, considering his status as a devout Catholic, nonetheless unlikely due to the papal ban on Catholics holding membership in Masonic organizations introduced by Pope Clement XII having gone into effect in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clement XII |first1=Pope |title=In Eminenti |url=https://www.papalencyclicals.net/clem12/c12inemengl.htm |website=papalenciclicals.net |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Haitian Revolution==\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791\u20131804) was a [[slave revolt]] in the [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]], which culminated in the elimination of [[slavery]] there and established the [[Republic of Haiti]]. It was the only slave revolt in the modern era that led to the founding of a [[Sovereign state|state]]. It is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred in the Americas.\n\n===The Rebellion: 1791\u20131794===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|right|Toussaint Louverture, as depicted in an 1802 French engraving]]\n\nBeginning in 1789, [[free people of color]] of Saint-Domingue were inspired by the [[French Revolution]] to seek an expansion of their rights and equality, while perpetuating the denial of freedom and rights to the slaves, who made up the overwhelming majority of population on the island. Initially, the slave population did not become involved in the conflict.<ref>Bell, pp.12\u201315; James, pp.81\u201382</ref> In August 1791, a Vodou ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] marked the start of a [[St. Domingue Slave Revolt|major slave rebellion]] in the north, which had the largest plantations and masses of slaves. Louverture apparently did not take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, but after a few weeks he sent his family to safety in Spanish [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] and helped the overseers of the Breda plantation to leave the island. He joined the forces of [[Georges Biassou]] as doctor to the troops, commanding a small detachment.<ref>James, p.90; Bell, pp.23\u201324</ref> Surviving documents show him participating in the leadership of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for supplies.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\"/>\n\nIn December 1791, he was involved in negotiations between rebel leaders and the French Governor, [[Philibert Fran\u00e7ois Rouxel de Blanchelande|Blanchelande]], for the release of their white prisoners and a return to work in exchange for a ban on the use of the whip, an extra non-working day per week, and freedom for a handful of leaders.<ref>Bell, p.32-33</ref> When the offer was rejected, he was instrumental in preventing the massacre of Biassou's white prisoners.<ref>Bell, p.33</ref> The prisoners were released after further negotiations with the French commissioners and taken to [[Le Cap]] by Louverture. He hoped to use the occasion to present the rebellion's demands to the colonial assembly, but they refused to meet with him.<ref>Bell, pp.34\u201335</ref>\n\nThroughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the ''Cordon de l'Ouest,'' a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory.<ref>Bell, pp.42\u201350</ref> He gained a reputation for running an orderly camp, trained his men in [[guerrilla]] tactics and \"the European style of war\",<ref>Bell, pp.46</ref> and began to attract soldiers who would play an important role throughout the revolution.<ref>Bell, pp.28, 55</ref> After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General [[\u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux]], but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader.<ref>Bell, p.50</ref>\n\nSome time in 1792\u201393, he adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for \"opening\" or \"the one who opened the way\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Lester|title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution: 1750-1850|url=https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang/page/111 111]}}</ref> Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in \"L'Ouverture\", he did not, as his extant correspondence indicates. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel's exclamation: \"That man makes an opening everywhere\". However, some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth.<ref>Bell, p.56</ref>\n\nDespite adhering to royalist political views, Louverture had begun to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution.<ref>James, pp.125\u2013126</ref> From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition.<ref>Bell, pp.86\u201387; James, p.107</ref> \n\nOn 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St Domingue:\n<blockquote>Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.<br /><br />Your very humble and obedient servant, Toussaint Louverture,<br /><br />General of the armies of the king, for the public good.<ref>Bell, p.18</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture Signature.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Toussaint Louverture's signature]]\n\nOn the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]], proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue,<ref>Bell, p.19</ref> hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.<ref>James, pp.128\u2013130</ref> Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.<ref>James, p.137</ref> However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, pp.141\u2013142</ref> For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general \u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux. During this time, competition between him and other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.<ref>Bell, pp.92\u201395</ref> In May 1794, when the decision of the French government became known in Saint-Domingue, Louverture switched allegiance from the Spanish to the French and rallied his troops to Laveaux.<ref>James pp.143\u2013144</ref>\n\n===Alliance with the French: 1794\u20131796===\n{{Slavery}}\nAfter months of skillful maneuvering that kept him on nominally good terms with the Spanish, while he also had secret correspondence with the new revolutionary French colonial government, Louverture officially joined the French in early May 1794, raising the republican flag over the port of [[Gona\u00efves]]. This provoked an exodus of refugees, both whites and free people of color, with many taking slaves with them.  In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the Cordon de l'Ouest, which he had held on their behalf.<ref>Bell, pp.104\u2013108</ref> \n\nHe faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the black slave rebellion were now fighting against him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was under attack from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the instability and gain control of the wealthy sugar-producing island.<ref>Bell, p.109</ref> On the other hand, he was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux's troops in joint actions.<ref>James, p.143</ref> By now his officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew [[Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse|Mo\u00efse]], [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], and [[Henri Christophe]].<ref>James, p.147</ref>\n\nBefore long, Louverture had put an end to the Spanish threat to French Saint-Domingue. In any case, the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] of July 1795 marked a formal end to hostilities between the two countries. Black leaders [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Biassou]] continued to fight against Louverture until November, when they left for Spain and Florida, respectively. At that point, most of their men joined Louverture's forces.<ref>Bell, p.115</ref> Louverture also made inroads against the British troops, but was unable to oust them from [[Saint-Marc]]. He contained them and rendered them ineffective by returning to guerilla tactics.<ref>Bell, pp.110\u2013114</ref>\n\nThroughout 1795 and 1796, Louverture was also concerned with re-establishing agriculture and exports, and keeping the peace in areas under his control. In speeches and policy he revealed his belief that the long-term freedom of the people of Saint-Domingue depended on the economic viability of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.113, 126</ref> He was held in general respect, and resorted to a mixture of diplomacy and force to return the field hands to the plantations as emancipated and paid workers.<ref>James, pp.155\u2013156</ref> Workers regularly created small rebellions, protesting poor conditions, their lack of real freedom, or fearing a return to slavery. They wanted to establish their own small holdings and work for themselves, rather than on plantations.<ref>James, pp.152\u2013154</ref>\n\nAnother of Louverture's concerns was to manage potential rivals for power within the French part of the colony. The most serious of these was the [[mulatto]] commander [[Jean-Louis Villatte]], based in [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]]. Louverture and Villate had competed over the command of some sections of troops and territory since 1794. Villatte was thought to be somewhat racist towards black soldiers such as Louverture and planned to ally with [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of colour, after overthrowing French General \u00c9tienne Laveaux.<ref>Laurent Dubois and John Garrigus, ''Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, 1789\u20131804: A Brief History with Documents''. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p.31</ref> In 1796 Villate drummed up popular support by accusing the French authorities of plotting a return to slavery. \n\nOn 20 March, he succeeded in capturing the French Governor Laveaux, and appointed himself Governor. Louverture's troops soon arrived at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to rescue the captured governor and drive Villatte out of town. Louverture was noted for opening the warehouses to the public, proving that they were empty of the chains that residents feared had been imported to prepare for a return to slavery. He was promoted to commander of the West Province two months later, and in 1797 was appointed as Saint-Domingue's top-ranking officer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\">Dubois and Garrigus, p.31</ref> Laveaux proclaimed Louverture as Lieutenant Governor, announcing at the same time that he would do nothing without his approval, to which Louverture replied, \"After God, Laveaux\".<ref>Bell, pp.132\u2013134; James, pp.163\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Third Commission: 1796\u201397===\nA few weeks after Louverture's triumph over the Villate insurrection, France's representatives of the third commission arrived in Saint-Domingue. Among them was [[Sonthonax]], the commissioner who had previously declared abolition of slavery on the same day as Louverture's proclamation of Camp Turel.<ref>Bell, p.136</ref> At first the relationship between the two men was positive. Sonthonax promoted Louverture to general and arranged for his sons, Placide and Isaac, to attend the school that had been established in France for the children of colonials.<ref>Bell, pp.137, 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nIn September 1796, elections were held to choose colonial representatives for the French national assembly. Louverture's letters show that he encouraged Laveaux to stand, and historians have speculated as to whether he was seeking to place a firm supporter in France or to remove a rival in power.<ref>Bell, pp.147\u2013148</ref> Sonthonax was also elected, either at Louverture's instigation or on his own initiative. While Laveaux left Saint-Domingue in October, Sonthonax remained.<ref>Bell, p.145, James, p.180</ref>\n\nSonthonax, a fervent revolutionary and fierce supporter of racial equality, soon rivalled Louverture in popularity. Although their goals were similar, they had several points of conflict.<ref>James, pp.174\u2013176; Bell, pp. 141\u2013142, 147</ref> They strongly disagreed about accepting the return of the white planters who had fled Saint-Domingue at the start of the revolution. To Sonthonax, they were potential counter-revolutionaries, to be assimilated, officially or not, with the \u2018[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]\u2019 who had fled the French Revolution and were forbidden to return under pain of death. To Louverture, they were bearers of useful skills and knowledge, and he wanted them back.<ref>Bell, pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nIn summer 1797, Louverture authorised the return of Bayon de Libertat, the ex-overseer of Br\u00e9da, with whom he had a lifelong relationship. Sonthonax wrote to Louverture threatening him with prosecution and ordering him to get Bayon off the island. Louverture went over his head and wrote to the French [[Directoire]] directly for permission for Bayon to stay.<ref>Bell, p.150</ref> Only a few weeks later, he began arranging for Sonthonax's return to France that summer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\"/> Louverture had several reasons to want to get rid of Sonthonax; officially he said that Sonthonax had tried to involve him in a plot to make Saint-Domingue independent, starting with a massacre of the whites of the island.<ref>Bell, pp.150\u2013153</ref> The accusation played on Sonthonax's political radicalism and known hatred of the aristocratic white planters, but historians have varied as to how credible they consider it.<ref>James, pp.190, Bell, pp.153\u2013154</ref>\n\nOn reaching France, Sonthonax countered by accusing Louverture of royalist, counter-revolutionary, and pro-independence tendencies.<ref>Bell, p.153</ref> Louverture knew that he had asserted his authority to such an extent that the French government might well suspect him of seeking independence.<ref>Bell, pp.153, 155</ref> At the same time, the French Directoire government was considerably less revolutionary than it had been. Suspicions began to brew that it might reconsider the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, p.179</ref> In November 1797, Louverture wrote again to the Directoire, assuring them of his loyalty but reminding them firmly that abolition must be maintained.<ref>Bell, p.155</ref>\n\n===Treaties with Britain and the United States: 1798===\n[[File:Maitland and Louverture.jpg|thumb|right|''General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] meets Louverture to discuss the secret treaty'']]\nFor several months, Louverture was in sole command of French Saint-Domingue, except for a semi-autonomous state in the south, where  general [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of color, had rejected the authority of the third commission.<ref>Bell, pp.142\u2013143</ref> Both generals continued attacking the British, whose position on Saint-Domingue was looking increasingly weak.<ref>James, p.201</ref> Louverture was negotiating their withdrawal when France's latest commissioner, [[Comte d'H\u00e9douville|Gabriel H\u00e9douville]], arrived in March 1798, with orders to undermine his authority.<ref>James, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 1798, Louverture signed a treaty with the British general, [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], exchanging the withdrawal of British troops from western Saint-Domingue for an amnesty for the French counter-revolutionaries in those areas. In May, [[Port-au-Prince]] was returned to French rule in an atmosphere of order and celebration.<ref>James, pp.202, 204</ref>\n\nIn July, Louverture and Rigaud met commissioner H\u00e9douville together. Hoping to create a rivalry that would diminish Louverture's power, H\u00e9douville displayed a strong preference for Rigaud, and an aversion to Louverture.<ref>James, pp.207\u2013208</ref> However, General Maitland was also playing on French rivalries and evaded H\u00e9douville's authority to deal with Louverture directly.<ref>James, pp.211\u2013212</ref> In August, Louverture and Maitland signed treaties for the evacuation of the remaining British troops. On 31 August, they signed a secret treaty which lifted the British blockade on Saint-Domingue in exchange for a promise that Louverture would not export the black revolution to the British colony of [[Jamaica]], which also used slaves to produce sugar.<ref>Bell, pp.159\u2013160</ref>\n\nAs Louverture's relationship with H\u00e9douville reached the breaking point, an uprising began among the troops of his adopted nephew, Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse. Attempts by H\u00e9douville to manage the situation made matters worse and Louverture declined to help him. As the rebellion grew to a full-scale insurrection, H\u00e9douville prepared to leave the island, while Louverture and Dessalines threatened to arrest him as a troublemaker.<ref>James, pp.219\u2013220</ref> H\u00e9douville sailed for France in October 1798, nominally transferring his authority to Rigaud. Louverture decided instead to work with Phillipe Roume, a member of the third commission who had been posted to the Spanish parts of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.165\u2013166</ref> Though Louverture continued to protest his loyalty to the French government, he had expelled a second government representative from the territory and was about to negotiate another autonomous agreement with one of France's enemies.<ref>Bell, pp.166\u2013167</ref>\n\nThe United States had suspended trade with France in 1798 because of increasing conflict over piracy. The two countries were almost at war, but trade between Saint-Domingue and the United States was desirable to both Louverture and the United States. With H\u00e9douville gone, Louverture sent [[Joseph Bunel]] to negotiate with the government of [[John Adams]]. The terms of the treaty were similar to those already established with the British, but Louverture continually resisted suggestions from either power that he should declare independence.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Black Talleyrand: Toussaint L'Ouverture's Secret Diplomacy with England and the United States\", ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 66:1 (Jan. 2009), 87\u2013124.</ref> As long as France maintained the abolition of slavery, he appeared to be content to have the colony remain French, at least in name.<ref>Bell, pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Expansion of territory: 1799\u20131801===\n\nIn 1799, the tensions between Louverture and [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]] came to a head. Louverture accused Rigaud of trying to assassinate him to gain power over Saint-Domingue for himself. Rigaud claimed Louverture was conspiring with the British to restore slavery.<ref>Bell, pp.174\u2013175</ref> The conflict was complicated by racial overtones which escalated tension between blacks and mulattoes.<ref>Bell, pp.175\u2013177, 178\u2013179; James, pp.229\u2013230</ref> Louverture had other political reasons for bringing down Rigaud. Only by controlling every port could he hope to prevent a landing of French troops if necessary.<ref>James, pp.224, 237</ref>\n\nAfter Rigaud sent troops to seize the border towns of [[Petit-Goave]] and [[Grand-Goave]] in June 1799, Louverture persuaded Roume to declare Rigaud a traitor and attacked the southern state.<ref>Bell, p.177</ref> The resulting civil war, known as the [[War of Knives]], lasted over a year, with the defeated Rigaud fleeing to [[Guadeloupe]], then France, in August 1800.<ref>Bell, pp.182\u2013185</ref> Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who became infamous, during and after the war, for massacring mulatto captives and civilians.<ref>Bell, pp.179\u2013180</ref> The number of deaths is contested: the contemporary French general Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while the 20th-century [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] historian [[C.L.R. James]] later claimed there were only a few hundred deaths in contravention of the amnesty.<ref>James, p.236-237</ref>\n\nIn November 1799, during the civil war, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France and passed a new constitution declaring that the colonies would be subject to special laws.<ref>Bell, p.180</ref> Although the colonies suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture's position and promising to maintain abolition.<ref>Bell, p.184</ref> But he also forbade Louverture to invade Spanish Santo Domingo, an action that would put Louverture in a powerful defensive position.<ref>Bell, p.186</ref> Louverture was determined to proceed anyway and coerced Roume into supplying the necessary permission.<ref>Bell, pp.180\u2013182, 187</ref> \n\nIn January 1801, Louverture and Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse invaded the Spanish territory, taking possession from the Governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area had been less developed and less densely populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, which abolished slavery, and embarked on a program of modernization. He was now master of the whole island.<ref>Bell, pp.189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Constitution of 1801===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture engraving.jpg|thumb|An early engraving of Louverture]]\nNapoleon had informed the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue that France would draw up a new constitution for its colonies, in which they would be subjected to special laws.<ref>Alexis, Stephen. ''Black Liberator.'' London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1949, p.165</ref> Despite his initial protestations to the contrary, the former slaves feared that he might restore slavery. In March 1801, Louverture appointed a constitutional assembly, composed chiefly of white planters, to draft a constitution for Saint-Domingue. He promulgated the Constitution on 7 July 1801, officially establishing his authority over the ''entire'' island of [[Hispaniola]]. It made him Governor-General for Life with near absolute powers and the possibility of choosing his successor. However, Louverture was not to explicitly declare Saint-Domingue's independence, acknowledging in Article 1 that it was a single colony of the French Empire.<ref>\"Constitution de la colonie fran\u00e7ais de Saint-Domingue\", Le Cap, 1801</ref>\nArticle 3 of the constitution states: \"There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.140</ref> The constitution guaranteed equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law for all races, but also confirmed Louverture's policies of forced labour and the importation of workers through the slave trade.<ref>Bell, pp.210\u2013211</ref> Louverture was not willing to compromise [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] for Vodou, the dominant faith among former slaves. Article 6 states that \"the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith shall be the only publicly professed faith.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.141</ref>\n\nLouverture charged Colonel [[Charles Humbert Marie Vincent|Vincent]] with the task of presenting the new constitution to Napoleon, although Vincent was horrified to learn that the general had gone so far. Several aspects of the constitution were damaging to France: the absence of provision for French government officials, the lack of advantages to France in trade with its own colony, and Louverture's breach of protocol in publishing the constitution before submitting it to the French government. Despite his disapproval, Vincent attempted to submit the constitution to Napoleon in a positive light, but was briefly exiled to Elba for his pains.<ref>Philippe Girard, ''The Slaves Who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Haitian War of Independence'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, November 2011).</ref>\n\nLouverture identified as a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty. He wrote to Napoleon but received no reply.<ref>James, p.263</ref> Napoleon eventually decided to send an expedition of 20,000 men to Saint-Domingue to restore French authority, and possibly to restore slavery as well.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and the Emancipation Issue in Saint-Domingue, 1799\u20131803,\" ''French Historical Studies'' 32:4 (Fall 2009), 587\u2013618.</ref> Given the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (March 1802-May 1803) with Great Britain, Napoleon was suddenly able to plan this operation without the risk of interception by the [[Royal Navy]].\n\n===Leclerc's campaign===\n\nNapoleon's troops, under the command of his brother-in-law, General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Emmanuel Leclerc]], were directed to seize control of the island by diplomatic means, proclaiming peaceful intentions, and keep secret his orders to deport all black officers.<ref>James, pp.292\u2013294, Bell, pp.223\u2013224</ref> Meanwhile, Louverture was preparing for defence and ensuring discipline. This may have contributed to a rebellion against forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Mo\u00efse, in October 1801. Because the activism was violently repressed, when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue was automatically on Louverture's side.<ref>Bell, pp.206\u2013209, 226\u2013229, 250</ref> In late January 1802, while Leclerc sought permission to land at [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] and Christophe held him off, the Vicomte de [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] suddenly attacked [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]], effectively quashing the diplomatic option.<ref>Bell, pp.232\u2013234</ref>\n\nLouverture's plan in case of war was to burn the coastal cities and as much of the plains as possible, retreat with his troops into the inaccessible mountains, and wait for [[yellow fever]], which flourished on a seasonal basis, to decimate the European troops.<ref>Bell, pp.234\u2013236</ref> The biggest impediment to this plan proved to be difficulty in internal communications. Christophe burned Cap-Fran\u00e7ais and retreated, but Paul Louverture was tricked by a false letter into allowing the French to occupy Santo Domingo; other officers believed Napoleon's diplomatic proclamation, while some attempted resistance instead of burning and retreating.<ref>Bell, pp.234, 236\u2013237</ref> French reports to Napoleon show that in the months of fighting that followed, the French felt their position was weak, but that Louverture and his generals did not fully realize their strength.<ref>Bell, p.256-260</ref>\n\nWith both sides shocked by the violence of the initial fighting, Leclerc tried belatedly to revert to the diplomatic solution. Louverture's sons and their tutor had been sent from France to accompany the expedition with this end in mind and were now sent to present Napoleon's proclamation to Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.237\u2013241</ref> When these talks broke down, months of inconclusive fighting followed. On 6 May 1802, Louverture rode into Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to treat with Leclerc. He negotiated an amnesty for all his remaining generals, then retired with full honors to his plantations at [[Ennery, Artibonite|Ennery]].<ref>Bell, pp.261\u2013262</ref>\n\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ann Whitney, Toussaint Louverture, plaster, 1870.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Toussaint L'Ouverture'', 1870]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] was at least partially responsible for Louverture's arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture's son Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture's conduct as \"extraordinary.\" For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girard|first1=Philippe R.|title=Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2012|volume=69|issue=3|page=559|url=http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Girard2012 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|quote=a list of \u201cextraordinary expenses incurred by General Brunet in regards to [the arrest of] Toussaint\u201d started with \u201cgifts in wine and liquor, gifts to Dessalines and his spouse, money to his officers: 4000 francs.\u201d|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0549|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125421/http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLeclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]] was ordered to do so, but accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One version said that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in [[Saint-Domingue]] and was asking Louverture's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs, however, suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Either way, Louverture had a letter, in which Brunet described himself as a \"sincere friend\", to take with him to France. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1 = Girard\n| first1 = Philippe R.\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title = The Slaves who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence, 1801\u20131804 | publisher = University of Alabama Press\n| place =\n| volume =\n| edition =\n| year = 2011\n}}</ref> Brunet deported Louverture and his aides to France on the frigate [[French frigate Cr\u00e9ole (1797)|''Cr\u00e9ole'']] and the 74-gun [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1801)|''H\u00e9ros'']], claiming that he suspected the former leader of plotting an uprising.

Brown was eventually captured and put on trial, and was hanged on 2 December 1859. Brown and his band showed devotion to the violent tactics of the Haitian Revolution. During the 19th century African Americans referred to Louverture as an example of how to reach freedom. Also during the 19th century, British writers focused on Louverture's domestic life and ignored his militancy to show him as an unthreatening rebel slave.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Clavin|first1=Matthew|title=A Second Haitian Revolution|journal=Civil War History|date=2008|volume=liv|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\n* English poet [[William Wordsworth]] published his sonnet \"To Toussaint L'Ouverture\" in January 1803.<ref>[http://www.nathanielturner.com/toussaintpoem.htm \"To Toussaint L'Ouverture\"] at ''ChickenBones: A Journal''.</ref>\n* African-American novelist [[Frank J.
