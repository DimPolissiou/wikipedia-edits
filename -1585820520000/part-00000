He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] for gallantry at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].\n\nAfter meeting members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at an 1846 Philadelphia conference, Kane offered to help in their conflicts with the US government as they tried to migrate West. He negotiated to allow them to occupy land along the Missouri River, and later worked to help Utah achieve statehood. He passed on an offer to govern the territory, giving the position to [[Brigham Young]]. During 1857 and 1858, Kane attempted to mediate a dispute between the Latter-day Saints and the US government, persuading Young to concede his governorship to President Buchanan's appointee, preventing further escalation of the [[Utah War]].\n\nDuring the Civil War, Kane organized a Pennsylvania regiment (the \"Bucktails\"), and served as lieutenant colonel. After his promotion of brigadier general of volunteers, he journeyed by to convey intelligence about Robert E. Lee's Gettysburg Campaign. Kane and his brigade were victorious at Gettysburg, but Kane had fallen ill and was forced to resign his commission. After the war, Kane and his family settled and helped establish Kane, Pennsylvania. He died of [[pneumonia]] in 1883. Both [[Kane County, Utah]] and [[Kanesville Tabernacle]] are named for Kane.

As it was a heavy winter, he traveled under an alias to Utah by way of [[Panama]], crossing the isthmus by the newly completed (1855) [[Panama Railroad]] and taking a ship north to southern California.

Kane then traveled to the army's winter base at Fort Bridger, and persuaded Governor Cumming to travel to Salt Lake City without his military escort. Cumming was courteously received by Young and Utah residents and was shortly installed in his new office. The army came into Utah some weeks later and was bivouacked on vacant land that became [[Camp Floyd]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} southwest of Salt Lake City.<ref name=CH/>{{rp|646}} The army left the territory in 1860 as the looming [[American Civil War|Civil War]] pulled in nearly all frontier troops.\n\nWhile in Salt Lake City, Kane received news that his father had died in 1858.

He recruited woodsmen and lumbermen from western Pennsylvania, men who were experienced in the woods, could forage for themselves, and could shoot rifles.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|28}} As the regiment was forming, one recruit ornamented his hat with a tail from a deer's carcass that he found in a butcher shop.

He stressed individual responsibility in his soldiers, a contradiction to the military thinking of the time. He held target practice, which was also an innovative idea, and drilled them in long-range firing, developing his men into fine sharpshooters.<ref name=\"the story\"/>\n\nThe Bucktails were assigned to the [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division of the [[V Corps (ACW)|V Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. When Colonel Biddle resigned to enter United States Congress, Lt. Col. Kane took command. On December 20, 1861, Kane was wounded while leading a patrol at the [[Battle of Dranesville]]. A bullet struck the right side of his face, knocking out some teeth and producing long-term difficulties with his vision.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|160}}\n\nBy the spring of 1862, Kane had partially recovered from his wound and returned to the Bucktails. They served as part of [[brigadier general|Brig. Gen.]] [[George Dashiell Bayard]]'s cavalry in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], fighting against [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s [[Valley Campaign]]. At [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]], he and 104 picked riflemen were sent to the rescue of an ambushed regiment. Kane encountered three [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] regiments on June 6, 1862. He was struck by a bullet that split the bone below his right knee and his men left him on the field. When he tried to rise after the fighting was over, a Confederate soldier broke his breastbone with a blow from the butt of his rifle and Kane, unconscious, was captured.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|160}} He was exchanged, for [[Williams C. Wickham]], in mid-August. He returned to duty in time for the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], but was so weakened that another officer led his regiment. He had to be helped onto his horse and was forced to walk using crutches; his Harrisonburg wound would reopen repeatedly for the next two years.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>\n\nKane was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers on September 7, 1862, and given command of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, [[XII Corps (ACW)|XII Corps]] of the Army of the Potomac.<ref name=\"sentinel\"/>{{rp|199}} This brigade was mustered out in March 1863 before Kane could lead it in combat.

He was  sent to a [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], hospital, where he remained through June. Upon hearing of General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s second invasion of the North (Lee's [[Gettysburg Campaign]]), Kane volunteered to convey intelligence to the commander of the Army of the Potomac, [[George Gordon Meade]], and rose from his sickbed to join his men. On a difficult ride by railroad and buggy, he avoided capture by Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry by disguising himself as a civilian. He arrived at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], on the morning of July 2, 1863.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>\n\nKane resumed command of his brigade, occupying a position on [[Culp's Hill]], the right of the Union line. His men did not participate in the bloody fighting of July 2 because his division, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John W. Geary]], was pulled out of the line and sent to defend against Confederate attacks on the Union left. (Due to bad navigation by Geary, the column took a wrong turn and never did reach the fighting that day.) However, when his men returned to their hastily constructed breastworks on Culp's Hill that night, they found Confederate soldiers occupying them and Kane's corps commander ordered an assault for early the next morning to regain the position.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|158}} Before the Union attack could be launched on July 3, the Confederates struck first, and Kane and his men met and repulsed them. During the action Kane fell ill and the brigade's second-in-command, Colonel [[George A. Cobham, Jr.]], actively assisted in command.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|157}} Although his brigade was victorious, Kane was a broken man and never recovered his health. He suffered from his festering facial wound, lingering chest problems, and impaired vision.<ref name=\"gettysburg\"/>{{rp|160}} He formally relinquished command the next day. He was then posted to [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he supervised the draft depot.

He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] for gallantry at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].\n\nAfter meeting members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at an 1846 Philadelphia conference, Kane offered to help in their conflicts with the US government as they tried to migrate West. He negotiated to allow them to occupy land along the Missouri River, and later worked to help Utah achieve statehood. He passed on an offer to govern the territory, giving the position to [[Brigham Young]]. During 1857 and 1858, Kane attempted to mediate a dispute between the Latter-day Saints and the US government, persuading Young to concede his governorship to President Buchanan's appointee, preventing further escalation of the [[Utah War]]. \n\nDuring the Civil War, Kane organized a Pennsylvania regiment (the \"Bucktails\"), and served as lieutenant colonel. After his promotion of brigadier general of volunteers, he journeyed by to convey intelligence about Robert E. Lee's Gettysburg Campaign. Kane and his brigade were victorious at Gettysburg, but Kane had fallen ill and was forced to resign his commission. After the war, Kane and his family settled and helped establish Kane, Pennsylvania. He died of [[pneumonia]] in 1883. Both [[Kane County, Utah]] and [[Kanesville Tabernacle]] are named for Kane.

==\n[[File:Wembley enggermatch.jpg|thumb|260px|Inside Wembley Stadium]]\n[[File:UAAP cheerdance competition at Araneta Coliseum.JPG|thumb|The annual [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]] routinely sells out the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena.]]\nThis section lists the most recent attendances at annual championship events (single decider matches or the final match in a best-of series only) by total attendance. It also includes domestic leagues and competitions. Additionally, it includes the finals of top-level promotion playoffs, in which teams play to determine potential or confirmed [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to a country's top league level in the next season. It has to be noted that the listed crowd figures are often a reflection of a championship venue's capacity, as demand for these events is generally so high that any stadium or arena would be filled to capacity.\n\nThe method by which championship venue(s) are determined can indirectly affect the attendance of such a match.\n\nIn most competitions that use a best-of final series, each individual match typically takes place at one team's home venue. In the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], a competition in which no team has its own home arena, finals matches (including any that can potentially end a series) are held at three large venues in or near Metro Manila: [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], [[Mall of Asia Arena]] and sometimes [[Philippine Arena]].\n\nIn most competitions that have a one-off final, the site is determined well in advance. Some competitions have a permanent site for their finals. Two notable examples are the [[Australian Football League]], whose [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] is always at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which holds its final matches in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|Gaelic football]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|hurling]] at [[Croke Park]]. Others determine the final venue anywhere from months to years before the event, such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], which determines the host of the [[Super Bowl]] more than three years in advance.\n\nHowever, one transnational club event in [[rugby union]] (whose final attendance is listed in [[#International club championship final events|a separate table]]) uses a very different system. In [[Super Rugby]], the final is awarded to the finalist that finished higher in the league table during the regular season. Another transnational club event in the same sport, [[Pro14]] (originally the Celtic League), used the same method to determine the host of its final until [[2015 Pro12 Grand Final|2015]], when it began to use a predetermined site.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, all 10 American college sports conferences that sponsor [[College football|football]] in the top-level [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] hold season-ending conference championship games in that sport. Of these leagues, six have a permanent site for their title games and four award hosting rights to the division champion with the better record in conference play (with tiebreakers used as needed).\n\nFor the purposes of this table, \"domestic\" is defined to include leagues which are historically focused in one country, but may have teams in one or more nearby countries. Examples of this phenomenon include:\n* Of the six largest [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|professional leagues in English-speaking North America]], only the two gridiron football leagues\u2014the NFL and CFL\u2014operate on one side of the U.S.\u2013Canada border. Of the four traditional \"major leagues\", only the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] has more than one team in Canada; as of the upcoming {{NHL Year|2019|app=season}}, it has 24 teams in the U.S. and seven in Canada, and will add [[Seattle NHL team|one U.S. team]] for 2021\u201322. [[Major League Soccer]], in recent years becoming increasingly accepted as a fifth \"major league\", currently has 21 U.S. teams and three Canadian teams, and will add four more U.S. teams by 2022.\n* The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which governs Gaelic games, is mostly restricted to the island of Ireland, although teams from [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York City]] participate in its senior championships.\n* Two major Australian leagues\u2014the National Rugby League (rugby league) and A-League (association football)\u2014have included a team from New Zealand since their inception.\n* The vast majority of the teams competing in rugby league's Super League have been from England. Only three teams from outside the country, two from France and one from Wales, have ever competed in the league, and only one of these teams (from France) currently competes at this level.\n* Although the Challenge Cup of rugby league currently includes teams from France, Ireland, Scotland, Serbia, and Wales, and has in the past also had teams from Canada and Russia, the overwhelming majority of the competing teams are from England.\n* The English association football pyramid includes several clubs from Wales, although Welsh clubs do not necessarily participate at every level in a given season. As of the current 2019\u201320 season, no Welsh teams play in the Premier League following the relegation of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], which had played at that level in 2013\u201314 and 2018\u201319. [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] played in the Premier League from 2011\u201312 to 2017\u201318.\n* The Kontinental Hockey League is headquartered in Moscow and is mostly a Russian league, although in its most recent 2018\u201319 season it also had teams in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Slovakia.\n\nThe [[EuroLeague]] in basketball is transnational in that it includes teams from multiple European countries, but is domestic in the sense of being a championship for the single entity of Europe. It is governed by [[Euroleague Basketball]], an explicitly pan-European body that is independent of the continental governing body of [[FIBA Europe]].\n\nThis contrasts with leagues such as Super Rugby and Pro14, which operate in multiple countries with more than one team in most (Super Rugby) or all (Pro14) of their participating countries, and also make no pretense of being a championship for a continental-size region.\n\n<!--\nNOTICE:\nThis section is meant for games where the championship was won. This includes all games in which the FINAL was a one-game affair. For best-of-x FINALS series, only include the game when the title was won (this inevitably includes all Game 7s in the finals).\n\nDon't add games where the title was not won. This includes any of the first three games in a best-of-7 finals, any game from the semifinals, quarterfinals, any stage in the playoffs, elimination round, regular season, and preseason. Preseason championships may be added. Finals of promotion playoffs may also be added.\n\nDon't add games from past seasons, even if they set records\u2014this is specifically for the MOST RECENT championship for which attendance figures are readily available.\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Event||Sport||Country||Competition||data-sort-type=\"number\"|Crowd||Year||Venue||City||Ref\n|-\n| [[AFL Grand Final]] || [[Australian rules football]] || Australia || [[Australian Football League]] || {{nts|100014}} || [[2019 AFL Grand Final|2019]] || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] ||[[Melbourne]] ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-09-28/match-report-2019-grand-final-richmond-v-greater-western-sydney |title=Orange crushed: Tigers roar once more under Dimma's dynasty |first=Riley |last=Beveridge |publisher=Australian Football League |date=28 September 2019 |accessdate=30 September 2019 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[FA Cup Final]] || Association football || England || [[FA Cup]] || {{nts|85854}} || [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/competitions/thefacup/match-stats?season=2018&competition=1&match=1054822 |title=The Emirates FA Cup, Match Stats: Manchester City 6\u20130 Watford |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=18 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Championship play-offs|EFL Championship Play-off]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Championship]] || {{nts|85826}} || [[2019 EFL Championship play-off Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London ||<ref name=\"2019 Championship playoff\">{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |title=Report: Championship Play-Off Final |publisher=[[English Football League]] |date=27 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527204140/https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |archive-date=27 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Trophy]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Trophy]] || {{nts|85021}} || [[2019 EFL Trophy Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |title=Checkatrade Trophy Final |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617091347/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n|-\n| [[Big 12 Championship Game]] || [[American football]] || United States || [[Big 12 Conference]] football || {{nts|83114}} || [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|2018]] || [[AT&T Stadium]] || [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] || <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |title=Gamecast: Dr Pepper Big 12 Championship |website=ESPN.com |date=December 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222152322/http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[NRL Grand Final]] || [[Rugby league]] || Australia|| [[National Rugby League]] || {{nts|82688}} || [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018]] || [[Stadium Australia]] || Sydney ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |title=Match Centre, Telstra Premiership Grand Final |website=National Rugby League |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001030928/https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] || [[Hurling]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] || 82,300 || [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2017]] || [[Croke Park]] || [[Dublin]] ||<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |title=Second half onslaught sees Tipperary reach the promised land |first=Gavin |last=Cummiskey |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019040712/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] || [[Gaelic football]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] || {{nts|82257}}{{refn|group=i|This attendance figure is for the originally scheduled 2016 All-Ireland final, which ended in a draw and thus required a replay.

==\n[[File:Wembley enggermatch.jpg|thumb|260px|Inside Wembley Stadium]]\n[[File:UAAP cheerdance competition at Araneta Coliseum.JPG|thumb|The annual [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]] routinely sells out the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena.]]\nThis section lists the most recent attendances at annual championship events (single decider matches or the final match in a best-of series only) by total attendance. It also includes domestic leagues and competitions. Additionally, it includes the finals of top-level promotion playoffs, in which teams play to determine potential or confirmed [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to a country's top league level in the next season. It has to be noted that the listed crowd figures are often a reflection of a championship venue's capacity, as demand for these events is generally so high that any stadium or arena would be filled to capacity.\n\nThe method by which championship venue(s) are determined can indirectly affect the attendance of such a match.\n\nIn most competitions that use a best-of final series, each individual match typically takes place at one team's home venue. In the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], a competition in which no team has its own home arena, finals matches (including any that can potentially end a series) are held at three large venues in or near Metro Manila: [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], [[Mall of Asia Arena]] and sometimes [[Philippine Arena]].\n\nIn most competitions that have a one-off final, the site is determined well in advance. Some competitions have a permanent site for their finals. Two notable examples are the [[Australian Football League]], whose [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] is always at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which holds its final matches in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|Gaelic football]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|hurling]] at [[Croke Park]]. Others determine the final venue anywhere from months to years before the event, such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], which determines the host of the [[Super Bowl]] more than three years in advance.\n\nHowever, one transnational club event in [[rugby union]] (whose final attendance is listed in [[#International club championship final events|a separate table]]) uses a very different system. In [[Super Rugby]], the final is awarded to the finalist that finished higher in the league table during the regular season. Another transnational club event in the same sport, [[Pro14]] (originally the Celtic League), used the same method to determine the host of its final until [[2015 Pro12 Grand Final|2015]], when it began to use a predetermined site.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, all 10 American college sports conferences that sponsor [[College football|football]] in the top-level [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] hold season-ending conference championship games in that sport. Of these leagues, six have a permanent site for their title games and four award hosting rights to the division champion with the better record in conference play (with tiebreakers used as needed).\n\nFor the purposes of this table, \"domestic\" is defined to include leagues which are historically focused in one country, but may have teams in one or more nearby countries. Examples of this phenomenon include:\n* Of the six largest [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|professional leagues in English-speaking North America]], only the two gridiron football leagues\u2014the NFL and CFL\u2014operate on one side of the U.S.\u2013Canada border. Of the four traditional \"major leagues\", only the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] has more than one team in Canada; as of the upcoming {{NHL Year|2019|app=season}}, it has 24 teams in the U.S. and seven in Canada, and will add [[Seattle NHL team|one U.S. team]] for 2021\u201322. [[Major League Soccer]], in recent years becoming increasingly accepted as a fifth \"major league\", currently has 21 U.S. teams and three Canadian teams, and will add four more U.S. teams by 2022.\n* The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which governs Gaelic games, is mostly restricted to the island of Ireland, although teams from [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York City]] participate in its senior championships.\n* Two major Australian leagues\u2014the National Rugby League (rugby league) and A-League (association football)\u2014have included a team from New Zealand since their inception.\n* The vast majority of the teams competing in rugby league's Super League have been from England. Only three teams from outside the country, two from France and one from Wales, have ever competed in the league, and only one of these teams (from France) currently competes at this level.\n* Although the Challenge Cup of rugby league currently includes teams from France, Ireland, Scotland, Serbia, and Wales, and has in the past also had teams from Canada and Russia, the overwhelming majority of the competing teams are from England.\n* The English association football pyramid includes several clubs from Wales, although Welsh clubs do not necessarily participate at every level in a given season. As of the current 2019\u201320 season, no Welsh teams play in the Premier League following the relegation of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], which had played at that level in 2013\u201314 and 2018\u201319. [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] played in the Premier League from 2011\u201312 to 2017\u201318.\n* The Kontinental Hockey League is headquartered in Moscow and is mostly a Russian league, although in its most recent 2018\u201319 season it also had teams in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Slovakia.\n\nThe [[EuroLeague]] in basketball is transnational in that it includes teams from multiple European countries, but is domestic in the sense of being a championship for the single entity of Europe. It is governed by [[Euroleague Basketball]], an explicitly pan-European body that is independent of the continental governing body of [[FIBA Europe]].\n\nThis contrasts with leagues such as Super Rugby and Pro14, which operate in multiple countries with more than one team in most (Super Rugby) or all (Pro14) of their participating countries, and also make no pretense of being a championship for a continental-size region.\n\n<!--\nNOTICE:\nThis section is meant for games where the championship was won. This includes all games in which the FINAL was a one-game affair. For best-of-x FINALS series, only include the game when the title was won (this inevitably includes all Game 7s in the finals).\n\nDon't add games where the title was not won. This includes any of the first three games in a best-of-7 finals, any game from the semifinals, quarterfinals, any stage in the playoffs, elimination round, regular season, and preseason. Preseason championships may be added. Finals of promotion playoffs may also be added.\n\nDon't add games from past seasons, even if they set records\u2014this is specifically for the MOST RECENT championship for which attendance figures are readily available.\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Event||Sport||Country||Competition||data-sort-type=\"number\"|Crowd||Year||Venue||City||Ref\n|-\n| [[AFL Grand Final]] || [[Australian rules football]] || Australia || [[Australian Football League]] || {{nts|100014}} || [[2019 AFL Grand Final|2019]] || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] ||[[Melbourne]] ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-09-28/match-report-2019-grand-final-richmond-v-greater-western-sydney |title=Orange crushed: Tigers roar once more under Dimma's dynasty |first=Riley |last=Beveridge |publisher=Australian Football League |date=28 September 2019 |accessdate=30 September 2019 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[FA Cup Final]] || Association football || England || [[FA Cup]] || {{nts|85854}} || [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/competitions/thefacup/match-stats?season=2018&competition=1&match=1054822 |title=The Emirates FA Cup, Match Stats: Manchester City 6\u20130 Watford |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=18 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Championship play-offs|EFL Championship Play-off]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Championship]] || {{nts|85826}} || [[2019 EFL Championship play-off Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London ||<ref name=\"2019 Championship playoff\">{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |title=Report: Championship Play-Off Final |publisher=[[English Football League]] |date=27 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527204140/https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |archive-date=27 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Trophy]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Trophy]] || {{nts|85021}} || [[2019 EFL Trophy Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |title=Checkatrade Trophy Final |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617091347/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n|-\n| [[Big 12 Championship Game]] || [[American football]] || United States || [[Big 12 Conference]] football || {{nts|83114}} || [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|2018]] || [[AT&T Stadium]] || [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] || <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |title=Gamecast: Dr Pepper Big 12 Championship |website=ESPN.com |date=December 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222152322/http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[NRL Grand Final]] || [[Rugby league]] || Australia|| [[National Rugby League]] || {{nts|82688}} || [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018]] || [[Stadium Australia]] || Sydney ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |title=Match Centre, Telstra Premiership Grand Final |website=National Rugby League |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001030928/https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] || [[Hurling]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] || 82,300 || [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2017]] || [[Croke Park]] || [[Dublin]] ||<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |title=Second half onslaught sees Tipperary reach the promised land |first=Gavin |last=Cummiskey |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019040712/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] || [[Gaelic football]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] || {{nts|82257}}{{refn|group=i|This attendance figure is for the originally scheduled 2016 All-Ireland final, which ended in a draw and thus required a replay.

Remaining amateurism requirements in the majority of top-level sports were dropped in the late 20th century, and there are now only a few amateur leagues which are of interest to a wide public.
