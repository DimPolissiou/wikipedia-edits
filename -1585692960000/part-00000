In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated. Unlike ordinary scheduling proceedings, such temporary orders are not subject to [[judicial review]].\n\nThe CSA also creates a closed system of distribution<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Closed System of Controlled Substance Distribution |title=Pharmacy Practice and the Law |page=184 |first=Richard R. |last=Abood |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn=978-1-4496-8691-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9gp80lkqXMC&pg=PA184 |access-date=2012-12-30 }}</ref> for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.\n\n==Treaty obligations==\nThe Congressional findings in [[21 USC]] \u00a7\u00a7 {{USCSub2|21|801|7}}, {{USCSub2|21|801a|2}}, and {{USCSub2|21|801a|3}} state that a major purpose of the CSA is to \"enable the United States to meet all of its obligations\" under international [[treaty|treaties]]. The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.\n\nThe domestic and international legal nature of these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts. In ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:\n\n{{quote|\n[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution, declares:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .\"\n\nThere is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights\u2014let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition\u2014to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. For example, in ''Geofroy v. Riggs'', 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\nThis Court has repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html|title=Reid v.

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.<ref name=\"cato.org\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf |title=Cato Handbook for Congress: Policy Recommendations for the 108th Congress |chapter=The War on Drugs |pages=171\u2013178 |year=2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>\n\nA provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to \"issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,\" without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to \"evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.\"\n\nSimilarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.\n\nThis provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:\n\n{{quote|Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html \"Date Rape\" Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.<ref name=\"cato.org\"/> The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]].

That bill was then superseded by the [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], which was passed as an amendment to the [[Patriot Act]] renewal and included wider and more comprehensive restrictions on the sale of PSE-containing products.

The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.\n\nThe domestic and international legal nature of these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts.

Covert]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:\n\n{{quote|\n[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution, declares:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .\"\n\nThere is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights\u2014let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition\u2014to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. For example, in ''Geofroy v. Riggs'', 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\nThis Court has repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html|title=Reid v.

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.<ref name=\"cato.org\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf |title=Cato Handbook for Congress: Policy Recommendations for the 108th Congress |chapter=The War on Drugs |pages=171\u2013178 |year=2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>\n\nA provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to \"issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,\" without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to \"evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.\"\n\nSimilarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.\n\nThis provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:\n\n{{quote|Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html \"Date Rape\" Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.<ref name=\"cato.org\"/> The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]].
