The next day, N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n, Manfredo's brother, takes him to the local [[police station]] in order to fill a [[complaint]] against \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez for rape of a mentally disable person, during the walk he reveals he plans to sue him in order to take his house, since both N\u00e9stor and Manfredo are [[homeless]], living in an [[intermodal container]]. N\u00e9stor hits Manfredo for opposing the denouncement, leaving him with a [[black eye]]. The police officer queries about Manfredo's wound, N\u00e9stor replies that the Gringo did it. The police officers takes Manfredo to the crime scene and ask him to pose in the position he was supposedly raped and took pictures of him. Later, Betty, G\u00f3mez's wife, finds out about the accusation and Gomez is taken to the police station, where he is made to sign a confession despite the fact that he is [[Literacy|illiterate]]. Meanwhile, the police takes pictures of the five [[witness]]es at the bar in the night of the crime.\n\nSince Rivas is making lobby to make it to judge in the amidst of the Argentine transition to democracy, the [[Evidence|case file]] is written by Rivas' assistant and signed by her and later sent to Soriano's desk, where it is received by Secretary Santi. When Soriano reads the file, she founds no proof at all of Manfredo's supposedly mental disabilities or evidence of a rape and is angered by the fact that the pleading only has two pages. She then asks the [[psychologist]] of the nearest town to make a new examination of Manfredo. When the psychologist arrives, she makes an examination of Manfredo using [[kinetic family drawing]], diagnosing him as mentally impaired, since he did not completed the test, he later cries about the situation. Soriano decides to visit G\u00f3mez and makes him read the confession he signed and confesses he cannot, since he does not know how to read and that he does not even knows why he is in jail. Later, Soriano goes to a [[clothes store]] and finds out Ferrera, the judge of the case, is gay. In El Escondido, Betty is talking with the commissary about how Gringo's house actually is on a usurious mortgage with him and that, if the Gringo can not pay, the commissary keeps the house. Soriano goes to the provincial courts to talk with Rivas, only to find out she lost every bit of empathy about her job. Soriano returns to her desk and talks with Santi about her disappointment with her work and, motivated by Rivas' dessidy, decides to go to El Escondido for a last try to clean G\u00f3mez's name. She meets a silent tramp who takes her to the chief deputy, mentions N\u00e9stor's [[criminal record]] and [[alcoholism]] and then he takes her to the town. She later confronts the local psychologist on her diagnosis. Meanwhile, the chief deputy calls Rivas about the arrival of Soriano to El Escondido. She asks him to prevent a key witness who is not revealed to the audience to talk with Soriano. The chief deputy ask her if there is a chance that Manfredo's brother was actually the one who caused Manfredo's black eye. Rivas asks him to not disclose this fact with anyone. Soriano goes to interrogate with four witness of the case and finds Betty, who now is in a relationship with the chief deputy and tells her she only married Gringo because his father had two [[horses]] and her father a [[plough]]. In her office, Rivas insults her assistant for the low effort he did on the pleading. After this talk with Betty, Soriano meets Mudo, who tells her that Manfredo it's who fixes the cars for him for the chief deputy.\n\nIn a meeting between Rivas and Ferrera, they discuss the news of the case and how she will dismiss Mudo as a witness because of his criminal record regarding stealing of motor vehicles parts and because he didn't said a word on his declaration. After Ferrera implies his support for Soriano, Rivas remembers him that he only made it to judge because of her contacts on the judicial family and pretending to be his girlfriend in order to fool the homophobic officials and that losing this minor case will truly affect her chances to become a judge. Then Santi tells her that el Mudo will be dismissed and that she lost the case. In the middle of her hopelessness, she sees Manfredo in the distance and pretends to have fallen. He helps her and tells him that the Gringo will be twelve years in jail thanks to his lack of action and gives him a [[business card]]. Santi visits Gringo in the prison unit, who tells him that he's being beaten by the other inmates and that even with [[solitary confinement]], the guards left the door open in order to allow the beatings. Santi replies that he can't respond to any of the violence or he will be charged with more years of jail. Soriano, Ferrera and Rivas have a meeting where Soriano talks about Manfredo's mechanic skills, Gringo's house issue and Betty's adultery with the chief deputy. And finally says Rivas didn't made pleading and criticizes her decision to not fire the assistant. Back in El Escondido, N\u00e9stor is attacking Manfredo with a [[slingshot]] because of his reunion with Soriano as he insults him with homophobic epithets.\n\nSoriano returns to her office, tired and expresses her discomfort with Santi about the uselessness of the four witnesses. Santi tells her that he won the lottery by betting 5-5-5, based on the amount of witnesses mentioned in the report of El Escondido's police, despite a missing page on it. After finding it, it turns out the missing witness it's the tramp that she met at the arrival to El Escondido. She goes to the town again and speaks with him, the tramp tells him that Manfredo was laughing and that he remembered it because it was the first time in his life that remembers Manfredo laughing. Manfredo takes the same bus that left Soriano in El Escondido and travels to the tribunals in Buenos Aires, where says his brother was the responsible of the wounds. Ferrera takes this as a sign of mental stability and declares G\u00f3mez innocent. Gomez returns to the town and finds out he has been kicked out of his house and that Betty now lives with the chief deputy. N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n dies electrocuted thanks to a water leak after kicking Manfredo out of the house. The Gringo and Manfredo reunite again and hug each other. Santi congratulates Soriano and she decides to take a day off.\n\nA written [[epilogue]] tells us that Rivas was named national judge twenty days after the absolution of The Gringo, that Manfredo Dom\u00e9stico kept working in Escondido and died of [[pneumonia]] in 2007, The Gringo left Escondido and his whereabouts are unknown and Gloria Soriano worked for 30 years, became a teacher and that she is still single.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paola Barrientos]] as Gloria Soriano, a public defender disillusioned with her work\n* Mar\u00eda Onetto as Mercedes \"Mecha\" Rivas, the prosecutor of the case\n* [[Dar\u00edo Grandinetti]] as Judge Ferrera, a member of the Argentine Judiciary\n* Dar\u00edo Barassi as Secretary Santi, the assistant of Gloria Soriano\n* [[Fern\u00e1n Mir\u00e1s]] as Manfredo Dom\u00e9stico, the victim in the case\n* Daniel Lambertini as Carlos Maximiliano \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez, the criminal of the case\n* Pacha Rosso as N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n Dom\u00e9stico, the brother of the victim\n* [[Jorgelina Aruzzi]] as Betty G\u00f3mez, the wife of \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez\n* Daniel La Rosa as the local [[chief deputy]]\n* Andr\u00e9s Zurita as Mudo, the mechanic\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Necochea Parque Miguel Lillo Buenos Aires Argentina.JPG|thumb|Miguel Lillo Park at Necochea, the forest in which the movie was filmed]]\n\nThe development of the film began when Roberto Gispert talk about the case in which this movie is inspired to Fern\u00e1n Miras.

The next day, N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n, Manfredo's brother, takes him to the local [[police station]] in order to fill a [[complaint]] against \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez for rape of a mentally disable person, during the walk he reveals he plans to sue him in order to take his house, since both N\u00e9stor and Manfredo are [[homeless]], living in an [[intermodal container]]. N\u00e9stor hits Manfredo for opposing the denouncement, leaving him with a [[black eye]]. The police officer queries about Manfredo's wound, N\u00e9stor replies that the Gringo did it. The police officers takes Manfredo to the crime scene and ask him to pose in the position he was supposedly raped and took pictures of him. Later, Betty, G\u00f3mez's wife, finds out about the accusation and Gomez is taken to the police station, where he is made to sign a confession despite the fact that he is [[Literacy|illiterate]]. Meanwhile, the police takes pictures of the five [[witness]]es at the bar in the night of the crime.\n\nSince Rivas is making lobby to make it to judge in the amidst of the Argentine transition to democracy, the [[Evidence|case file]] is written by Rivas' assistant and signed by her and later sent to Soriano's desk, where it is received by Secretary Santi. When Soriano reads the file, she founds no proof at all of Manfredo's supposedly mental disabilities or evidence of a rape and is angered by the fact that the pleading only has two pages. She then asks the [[psychologist]] of the nearest town to make a new examination of Manfredo. When the psychologist arrives, she makes an examination of Manfredo using [[kinetic family drawing]], diagnosing him as mentally impaired, since he did not completed the test, he later cries about the situation. Soriano decides to visit G\u00f3mez and makes him read the confession he signed and confesses he cannot, since he does not know how to read and that he does not even knows why he is in jail. Later, Soriano goes to a [[clothes store]] and finds out Ferrera, the judge of the case, is gay. In El Escondido, Betty is talking with the commissary about how Gringo's house actually is on a usurious mortgage with him and that, if the Gringo can not pay, the commissary keeps the house. Soriano goes to the provincial courts to talk with Rivas, only to find out she lost every bit of empathy about her job. Soriano returns to her desk and talks with Santi about her disappointment with her work and, motivated by Rivas' dessidy, decides to go to El Escondido for a last try to clean G\u00f3mez's name. She meets a silent tramp who takes her to the chief deputy, mentions N\u00e9stor's [[criminal record]] and [[alcoholism]] and then he takes her to the town. She later confronts the local psychologist on her diagnosis. Meanwhile, the chief deputy calls Rivas about the arrival of Soriano to El Escondido. She asks him to prevent a key witness who is not revealed to the audience to talk with Soriano. The chief deputy ask her if there is a chance that Manfredo's brother was actually the one who caused Manfredo's black eye. Rivas asks him to not disclose this fact with anyone. Soriano goes to interrogate with four witness of the case and finds Betty, who now is in a relationship with the chief deputy and tells her she only married Gringo because his father had two [[horses]] and her father a [[plough]]. In her office, Rivas insults her assistant for the low effort he did on the pleading. After this talk with Betty, Soriano meets Mudo, who tells her that Manfredo it's who fixes the cars for him for the chief deputy.\n\nIn a meeting between Rivas and Ferrera, they discuss the news of the case and how she will dismiss Mudo as a witness because of his criminal record regarding stealing of motor vehicles parts and because he didn't said a word on his declaration. After Ferrera implies his support for Soriano, Rivas remembers him that he only made it to judge because of her contacts on the judicial family and pretending to be his girlfriend in order to fool the homophobic officials and that losing this minor case will truly affect her chances to become a judge. Then Santi tells her that el Mudo will be dismissed and that she lost the case. In the middle of her hopelessness, she sees Manfredo in the distance and pretends to have fallen. He helps her and tells him that the Gringo will be twelve years in jail thanks to his lack of action and gives him a [[business card]]. Santi visits Gringo in the prison unit, who tells him that he's being beaten by the other inmates and that even with [[solitary confinement]], the guards left the door open in order to allow the beatings. Santi replies that he can't respond to any of the violence or he will be charged with more years of jail. Soriano, Ferrera and Rivas have a meeting where Soriano talks about Manfredo's mechanic skills, Gringo's house issue and Betty's adultery with the chief deputy. And finally says Rivas didn't made pleading and criticizes her decision to not fire the assistant. Back in El Escondido, N\u00e9stor is attacking Manfredo with a [[slingshot]] because of his reunion with Soriano as he insults him with homophobic epithets.\n\nSoriano returns to her office, tired and expresses her discomfort with Santi about the uselessness of the four witnesses. Santi tells her that he won the lottery by betting 5-5-5, based on the amount of witnesses mentioned in the report of El Escondido's police, despite a missing page on it. After finding it, it turns out the missing witness it's the tramp that she met at the arrival to El Escondido. She goes to the town again and speaks with him, the tramp tells him that Manfredo was laughing and that he remembered it because it was the first time in his life that remembers Manfredo laughing. Manfredo takes the same bus that left Soriano in El Escondido and travels to the tribunals in Buenos Aires, where says his brother was the responsible of the wounds. Ferrera takes this as a sign of mental stability and declares G\u00f3mez innocent. Gomez returns to the town and finds out he has been kicked out of his house and that Betty now lives with the chief deputy. N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n dies electrocuted thanks to a water leak after kicking Manfredo out of the house. The Gringo and Manfredo reunite again and hug each other. Santi congratulates Soriano and she decides to take a day off.\n\nA written [[epilogue]] tells us that Rivas was named national judge twenty days after the absolution of The Gringo, that Manfredo Dom\u00e9stico kept working in Escondido and died of [[pneumonia]] in 2007, The Gringo left Escondido and his whereabouts are unknown and Gloria Soriano worked for 30 years, became a teacher and that she is still single.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paola Barrientos]] as Gloria Soriano, a public defender disillusioned with her work\n* Mar\u00eda Onetto as Mercedes \"Mecha\" Rivas, the prosecutor of the case\n* [[Dar\u00edo Grandinetti]] as Judge Ferrera, a member of the Argentine Judiciary\n* Dar\u00edo Barassi as Secretary Santi, the assistant of Gloria Soriano\n* [[Fern\u00e1n Mir\u00e1s]] as Manfredo Dom\u00e9stico, the victim in the case\n* Daniel Lambertini as Carlos Maximiliano \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez, the criminal of the case\n* Pacha Rosso as N\u00e9stor Fabi\u00e1n Dom\u00e9stico, the brother of the victim\n* [[Jorgelina Aruzzi]] as Betty G\u00f3mez, the wife of \"Gringo\" G\u00f3mez\n* Daniel La Rosa as the local [[chief deputy]]\n* Andr\u00e9s Zurita as Mudo, the mechanic\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Necochea Parque Miguel Lillo Buenos Aires Argentina.JPG|thumb|Miguel Lillo Park at Necochea, the forest in which the movie was filmed]]\n\nThe development of the film began when Roberto Gispert talk about the case in which this movie is inspired to Fern\u00e1n Miras.

We are nevertheless inclined...to keep the North-African and Indian Jackals distinct...The reasons why we prefer to keep them provisionally distinct is that though the difference between the two forms (African and Indian) is slight as regards coloration, yet it appears to be a very constant one. Out of seventeen skins of the Indian form, we have only found one which is wanting in the main characteristic as to difference of hue. The ears also are relatively shorter than in the North-African form. But there is another character to which we attach greater weight.

Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis Department of Bioscience Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Oslo, Norway</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed by scientists at the [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[University of Helsinki|Helsinki Universities]] that the binomial name ''C. anthus'' was a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', on account of the fact that Cuvier's 1820 description of the [[holotype]], a female collected from Senegal, seems to be describing the [[side-striped jackal]] rather than the actual African golden wolf, and does not match the appearance of a male specimen described by Cuvier in his later writings. This ambiguity, coupled with the disappearance of the holotype's remains, led to the scientists proposing giving priority to [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich|Hemprich]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]'s name ''C. lupaster'', due to the [[type specimen]] having a more detailed and consistent description, and its remains being still examinable at the [[Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]].<ref name=viranta2017/> The following year, a major genetic study of ''Canis'' species also referred to the African golden wolf as ''Canis lupaster''.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommended that because the specimen identified as ''Canis anthus'' Cuvier, 1820 was uncertain, the species should be known as ''Canis lupaster'' Hemprich and Ehrenberg, 1832 until ''Canis anthus'' can be validated.<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n===Admixture with other ''Canis'' species===\nIn 2018, [[whole genome sequencing]] was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The study supports the African golden wolf being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the [[Ethiopian wolf]] being genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to both. There are two genetically distinct African golden wolf populations that exist in northwestern and eastern Africa. This suggests that Ethiopian wolves \u2013 or a close and extinct relative \u2013 once had a much larger range within Africa to admix with other canids. There is evidence of gene flow between the eastern population and the Ethiopian wolf, which has led to the eastern population being distinct from the northwestern population. The common ancestor of both African golden wolf populations was a genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% gray wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves,  golden jackals, and gray wolves. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and continents in canid evolution. African golden wolves form a sister clade to Middle Eastern gray wolves based on mitochondrial DNA, but to coyotes and gray wolves based on nuclear DNA.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\n===Relationship to the Himalayan wolf===\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] and [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian wolf]] were closer to the African golden wolf than they were to the Holarctic gray wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> In 2017, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]], [[X-chromosome]] (maternal lineage) markers and [[Y-chromosome]] (male lineage) markers found that the Himalayan wolf is genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the Holarctic gray wolf.

The basic social unit is a breeding pair, followed by its current offspring, or offspring from previous litters staying as \"helpers\".<ref name=\"jhala2004\"/> Large groups are rare, and have only been recorded to occur in areas with abundant human waste. Family relationships among African golden wolves are comparatively peaceful compared to those of the [[black-backed jackal]]; although the sexual and territorial behavior of grown pups is suppressed by the breeding pair, they are not actively driven off once they attain adulthood. African golden wolves also lie together and groom each other much more frequently than black-backed jackals. In the Serengeti, pairs defend permanent territories encompassing 2\u20134&nbsp;km\u00b2, and will vacate their territories only to drink or when lured by a large carcass.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> The pair patrols and [[territorial marking|marks its territory]] in tandem. Both partners and helpers will react aggressively towards intruders, though the greatest aggression is reserved for intruders of the same sex; pair members do not assist each other in repelling intruders of the opposite sex.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n[[File:Canis anthus threat postures.png|thumb|Threat postures in ''C. a. lupaster'' (left) and ''C. a. anthus'' (right)]]\n{{anchor|Courtship}}The African golden wolf's courtship rituals are remarkably long, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and [[scent mark]]s its territory. [[Animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] is preceded by the female holding her tail out and angled in such a way that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behavior. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The [[copulatory tie]] lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December\u2013January, and begin eating solid food after a month. [[Weaning]] starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 meters from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behavior becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe African golden wolf's life centers around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified [[aardvark]] or [[warthog]] earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2\u20133 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.<ref name=\"r47\"/>\n\n===Communication===\nAfrican golden wolves frequently groom one another, particularly during courtship, during which it can last up to 30 minutes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African golden wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its [[canine teeth]] like a dog.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe vocabulary of the African golden wolf is similar to that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> The African golden wolf's vocalizations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> A comparative analysis of African golden wolf and some gray wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the [[Indian wolf]], being high-pitched and of relatively short duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hennelly | first1 = Lauren | last2 = Habib | first2 = Bilal | last3 = Root-Gutteridge | first3 = Holly | last4 = Palacios | first4 = Vicente | last5 = Passilongo | first5 = Daniela | year = 2017 | title = Howl variation across Himalayan, North African, Indian, and Holarctic wolf clades: tracing divergence in the world's oldest wolf lineages using acoustics | url = | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 341\u2013348 | doi=10.1093/cz/zox001| pmid = 29491993 | pmc = 5804178 }}</ref>\n\n===Hunting behavior===\n[[File:Golden Wolf, navigating Wildebeest, Ngorongoro.jpg|thumb|right|A Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') navigating through a herd of [[blue wildebeest]] in the [[Ngorongoro National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nThe African golden wolf rarely catches hares, due to their speed. [[Gazelle]] mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single wolves, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. A pair of wolves will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nAlthough it is known to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African golden wolf targets mammalian prey much less frequently than the [[black-backed jackal]] overall.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> On capturing large prey, the African golden wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African golden wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours.<ref name=\"r47\"/> When foraging for insects, the African golden wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they are on the ground or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate [[Old World Vulture|vultures]] on kills \u2013 one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Distribution and habitat===\nFossil finds dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] indicate that the species' range was not always restricted to Africa, with remains having been found in the [[Levant]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=viranta2017/> In [[Tanzania]], the African golden wolf is limited to a small area of the north between the western slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the centre of the [[Serengeti]]. In the latter area, it occurs mostly in the short-grass plains, the floor of the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and the plains between the Olmoti and Empakai Craters, being relatively rare in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Loliondo]] and the [[Maswa District|Maswa]] game reserve. The species also inhabits the [[Lake Natron]] area and West Kilimanjaro. It is sometimes found in the northern part of [[Arusha National Park]], and as far south as [[Manyara Region|Manyara]]. In areas where it is common, such as the short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, population densities can range between 0.5-1.5 specimens per km<sup>2</sup>. A population decrease of 60% has been recorded in the southern plains of Serengeti National Park since the early 1970s, though the reasons are unknown.<ref>Foley, C. et al.

We are nevertheless inclined...to keep the North-African and Indian Jackals distinct...The reasons why we prefer to keep them provisionally distinct is that though the difference between the two forms (African and Indian) is slight as regards coloration, yet it appears to be a very constant one. Out of seventeen skins of the Indian form, we have only found one which is wanting in the main characteristic as to difference of hue. The ears also are relatively shorter than in the North-African form. But there is another character to which we attach greater weight. However much the different races of Wolves differ in size, we have not succeeded in finding any constant distinctive characters in the form of the skull or the proportions of the lobes of any of the teeth.

Considering its phylogenetic position and the canid [[fossil record]], it is likely that the African golden wolf evolved from larger ancestors that became progressively more jackal-like in size upon populating Africa on account of [[interspecific competition]] with both larger and smaller indigenous [[Carnivora|carnivores]].

Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis Department of Bioscience Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Oslo, Norway</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed by scientists at the [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[University of Helsinki|Helsinki Universities]] that the binomial name ''C. anthus'' was a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', on account of the fact that Cuvier's 1820 description of the [[holotype]], a female collected from Senegal, seems to be describing the [[side-striped jackal]] rather than the actual African golden wolf, and does not match the appearance of a male specimen described by Cuvier in his later writings. This ambiguity, coupled with the disappearance of the holotype's remains, led to the scientists proposing giving priority to [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich|Hemprich]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]'s name ''C. lupaster'', due to the [[type specimen]] having a more detailed and consistent description, and its remains being still examinable at the [[Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]].<ref name=viranta2017/> The following year, a major genetic study of ''Canis'' species also referred to the African golden wolf as ''Canis lupaster''.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommended that because the specimen identified as ''Canis anthus'' Cuvier, 1820 was uncertain, the species should be known as ''Canis lupaster'' Hemprich and Ehrenberg, 1832 until ''Canis anthus'' can be validated.<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n===Admixture with other ''Canis'' species===\nIn 2018, [[whole genome sequencing]] was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The study supports the African golden wolf being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the [[Ethiopian wolf]] being genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to both. There are two genetically distinct African golden wolf populations that exist in northwestern and eastern Africa. This suggests that Ethiopian wolves \u2013 or a close and extinct relative \u2013 once had a much larger range within Africa to admix with other canids. There is evidence of gene flow between the eastern population and the Ethiopian wolf, which has led to the eastern population being distinct from the northwestern population. The common ancestor of both African golden wolf populations was a genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% gray wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves,  golden jackals, and gray wolves. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and continents in canid evolution. African golden wolves form a sister clade to Middle Eastern gray wolves based on mitochondrial DNA, but to coyotes and gray wolves based on nuclear DNA.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\n===Relationship to the Himalayan wolf===\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] and [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian wolf]] were closer to the African golden wolf than they were to the Holarctic gray wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> In 2017, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]], [[X-chromosome]] (maternal lineage) markers and [[Y-chromosome]] (male lineage) markers found that the Himalayan wolf is genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the Holarctic gray wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf, and possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the gray wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\n\n===Subspecies===\nAlthough in the past several attempts have been made to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymise]] many of the proposed names, the taxonomic position of West African wolves, in particular, is too confused to come to any precise conclusion, as the collected study materials are few. Prior to 1840, six of the 10 supposed West African subspecies were named or classed almost entirely because of their fur color.<ref name=\"r38\">Rosevear, Donovan Reginald (1974). \"The carnivores of West Africa\".

The basic social unit is a breeding pair, followed by its current offspring, or offspring from previous litters staying as \"helpers\".<ref name=\"jhala2004\"/> Large groups are rare, and have only been recorded to occur in areas with abundant human waste. Family relationships among African golden wolves are comparatively peaceful compared to those of the [[black-backed jackal]]; although the sexual and territorial behavior of grown pups is suppressed by the breeding pair, they are not actively driven off once they attain adulthood. African golden wolves also lie together and groom each other much more frequently than black-backed jackals. In the Serengeti, pairs defend permanent territories encompassing 2\u20134&nbsp;km\u00b2, and will vacate their territories only to drink or when lured by a large carcass.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> The pair patrols and [[territorial marking|marks its territory]] in tandem. Both partners and helpers will react aggressively towards intruders, though the greatest aggression is reserved for intruders of the same sex; pair members do not assist each other in repelling intruders of the opposite sex.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n[[File:Canis anthus threat postures.png|thumb|Threat postures in ''C. a. lupaster'' (left) and ''C. a. anthus'' (right)]]\n{{anchor|Courtship}}The African golden wolf's courtship rituals are remarkably long, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and [[scent mark]]s its territory. [[Animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] is preceded by the female holding her tail out and angled in such a way that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behavior. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The [[copulatory tie]] lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December\u2013January, and begin eating solid food after a month. [[Weaning]] starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 meters from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behavior becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe African golden wolf's life centers around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified [[aardvark]] or [[warthog]] earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2\u20133 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.<ref name=\"r47\"/>\n\n===Communication===\nAfrican golden wolves frequently groom one another, particularly during courtship, during which it can last up to 30 minutes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African golden wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its [[canine teeth]] like a dog.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe vocabulary of the African golden wolf is similar to that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> The African golden wolf's vocalizations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> A comparative analysis of African golden wolf and some gray wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the [[Indian wolf]], being high-pitched and of relatively short duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hennelly | first1 = Lauren | last2 = Habib | first2 = Bilal | last3 = Root-Gutteridge | first3 = Holly | last4 = Palacios | first4 = Vicente | last5 = Passilongo | first5 = Daniela | year = 2017 | title = Howl variation across Himalayan, North African, Indian, and Holarctic wolf clades: tracing divergence in the world's oldest wolf lineages using acoustics | url = | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 341\u2013348 | doi=10.1093/cz/zox001| pmid = 29491993 | pmc = 5804178 }}</ref>\n\n===Hunting behavior===\n[[File:Golden Wolf, navigating Wildebeest, Ngorongoro.jpg|thumb|right|A Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') navigating through a herd of [[blue wildebeest]] in the [[Ngorongoro National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nThe African golden wolf rarely catches hares, due to their speed. [[Gazelle]] mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single wolves, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. A pair of wolves will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nAlthough it is known to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African golden wolf targets mammalian prey much less frequently than the [[black-backed jackal]] overall.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> On capturing large prey, the African golden wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African golden wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours.<ref name=\"r47\"/> When foraging for insects, the African golden wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they are on the ground or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate [[Old World Vulture|vultures]] on kills \u2013 one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Distribution and habitat===\nFossil finds dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] indicate that the species' range was not always restricted to Africa, with remains having been found in the [[Levant]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=viranta2017/> In [[Tanzania]], the African golden wolf is limited to a small area of the north between the western slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the centre of the [[Serengeti]]. In the latter area, it occurs mostly in the short-grass plains, the floor of the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and the plains between the Olmoti and Empakai Craters, being relatively rare in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Loliondo]] and the [[Maswa District|Maswa]] game reserve. The species also inhabits the [[Lake Natron]] area and West Kilimanjaro. It is sometimes found in the northern part of [[Arusha National Park]], and as far south as [[Manyara Region|Manyara]]. In areas where it is common, such as the short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, population densities can range between 0.5-1.5 specimens per km<sup>2</sup>. A population decrease of 60% has been recorded in the southern plains of Serengeti National Park since the early 1970s, though the reasons are unknown.<ref>Foley, C. et al.

Date || Event\n|-\n|January 1\n|[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] is launched.\n|-\n|January 2\n|The [[1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|1994\u201396 United States broadcast TV realignment]] continues in two major markets: as a by-product of an affiliation deal between [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[The E.W. Scripps Company]], and a related deal between [[CBS]] and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]], Westinghouse-owned [[WBZ-TV]] (channel 4) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] switches from [[NBC]] to CBS, while NBC aligns with former CBS affiliate [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] (which will remain affiliated with the network until New Year's Eve 2016). In Baltimore, CBS switches affiliations to Westinghouse-owned [[WJZ-TV]] (channel 13) after 46 years as an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, while ABC joins Scripps-owned [[WMAR]] (channel 2) and NBC reunites with [[WBAL-TV]] (channel 11) after 13 years as a CBS affiliate. Later that year, Westinghouse acquires CBS, making both WBZ-TV and WJZ-TV [[CBS Television Stations|CBS owned-and-operated stations]].\n|-\n|January 5\n|''[[All My Children]]'' celebrates its 25th anniversary and broadcasts a prime-time special on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n|-\n|January 11\n|[[The WB Television Network]], a joint venture between [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in conjunction with original network CEO [[Jamie Kellner]], launches. Among the programs offered are four situation comedies (two family-oriented, one family-focused but adult-targeted and one adult-oriented soap opera-inspired satire): ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'' (starring former ''[[In Living Color]]'' DJ/cast member [[Shawn Wayans]] and his younger brother, [[Marlon Wayans]]), ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]'' (starring [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]), ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'' and ''[[Muscle (TV series)|Muscle]]''. While the former three series wound up lasting five seasons, ''Muscle'' fails to survive its first season. In addition to being available on around 70 affiliates, The WB is also initially distributed directly to cable and satellite providers via the [[WGN America|superstation feed]] of [[Chicago]] charter affiliate [[WGN-TV]] (owned by Tribune) to serve markets where the lack of available independent stations or stations that passed over the network in favor of fellow fledgling network UPN prevented The WB from maintaining an exclusive affiliation at launch.

A [[remake]] of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]] and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]], it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Gabriel Bateman]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]], and [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]. It is an international co-production of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe development of a ''Child's Play'' remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 [[science fiction film]], ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Principal photography]] lasted from September to November 2018 in [[Vancouver]], Canada.\n\n''Child's Play'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by [[Orion Pictures]] through [[United Artists|United Artists Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At an assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend other two children in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. He tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris and his partner Willis begin an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Norris and Willis travel to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Willis is murdered, Norris is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky managed to transfer his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n** Hamill also voices other ''Buddi'' dolls seen in the film, and previously voiced Chucky on an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...

The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At a assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend other two children in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. He tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris and his partner Willis begin an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Norris and Willis travel to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Willis is murdered, Norris is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky managed to transfer his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n** Hamill also voices other ''Buddi'' dolls seen in the film, and previously voiced Chucky on an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...

A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. [[Laurence Olivier]] once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\".<ref name=\"THR\" /> [[Clarence Brown]], who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' and ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93 | website=Dallas News | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93/ | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRooney first performed in [[vaudeville]] as a child and made his film debut at the age of six.

[[Conscription|Drafted]] into the Army during [[World War II]], he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']] and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'' (1981).\n\n== Early life ==\nRooney was born Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] Nellie W.

Hardy, portrayed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] (although [[Lewis Stone]] played the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more ''[[Andy Hardy]]'' films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.\n\nAccording to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney's character portrayed a typical \"anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager\", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as \"sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable,\" their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a \"comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times\", with Rooney instilling \"a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like\".<ref name=Monush />\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the \"hyperactive girl-crazy teenager\" he portrayed on the screen. [[Wallace Beery]], his co-star in ''[[Stablemates]]'', described him as a \"brat\", but a \"fine actor\".{{sfn | Marx | 1986 | p=68}} MGM head [[Louis B.

Thomson also explains that Rooney's characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where \"Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:\"<ref name=Thomson />\n\n{{quote|Rooney's Puck in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] (1935) is truly inhuman, one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic.&nbsp;...

In 1948 and 1949 together, I starred in only three.\"<ref name=Unterburger /> However, film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] notes that although his career \"reached the heights and plunged to the depths, Rooney kept on working and growing, the mark of a professional.\" Some of the films which reinvigorated his popularity, were ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']], and \"found himself once more back on top\".<ref name=Unterburger />\n\nBasinger tries to encapsulate Rooney's career:\n\n{{quote|Rooney's abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity. From child star to character actor, from movie shorts to television specials, and from films to Broadway, Rooney ultimately did prove he could do it all, do it well, and keep on doing it.

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent-film era.<ref name=\"Mickey Rooney, an enduring star\">{{cite web | title=Mickey Rooney, an enduring star | website=BostonGlobe.com | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/04/07/rooney/coAEzsSNMsl3jNIE2EzqNP/story.html | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of [[Andy Hardy]] in a series of 16 films in the 1930's and 1940's that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. [[Laurence Olivier]] once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\".<ref name=\"THR\" /> [[Clarence Brown]], who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' and ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93 | website=Dallas News | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93/ | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRooney first performed in [[vaudeville]] as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']]. Critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in [[Boys Town (film)|''Boys Town'']]. At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', and he was awarded a special [[Academy Juvenile Award]] in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mickey-rooney-career-20140407,0,3547872,full.story#axzz2yVrN04QO|title=Mickey Rooney: A long and remarkable career in film, TV|author=Los Angeles Times|work=latimes.com|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}</ref> At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]].\n\nRooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941<ref name=\"Vanity Fair \u2013 April 7, 2014\" /> and one of the best-paid actors of that era,<ref name=\"THR\" /> but his career would never again rise to such heights. [[Conscription|Drafted]] into the Army during [[World War II]], he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']] and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'' (1981).\n\n== Early life ==\nRooney was born Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] Nellie W.

Hardy, portrayed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] (although [[Lewis Stone]] played the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more ''[[Andy Hardy]]'' films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.\n\nAccording to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney's character portrayed a typical \"anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager\", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as \"sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable,\" their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a \"comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times\", with Rooney instilling \"a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like\".<ref name=Monush />\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the \"hyperactive girl-crazy teenager\" he portrayed on the screen. [[Wallace Beery]], his co-star in ''[[Stablemates]]'', described him as a \"brat\", but a \"fine actor\".{{sfn | Marx | 1986 | p=68}} MGM head [[Louis B.

In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']], and \"found himself once more back on top\".<ref name=Unterburger />\n\nBasinger tries to encapsulate Rooney's career:\n\n{{quote|Rooney's abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity.

The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan and North America in 2011, in [[PAL region]]s by [[Deep Silver]] in 2012, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] by [[Sega]] in 2019. A re-release with additional content, titled '''''Catherine: Full Body''''',{{efn|{{nihongo||\u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30d5\u30eb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3|Kyasarin: Furu Bodi}}}} was released in 2019 for the [[PlayStation 4]] worldwide and for the [[PlayStation Vita]] only in Japan, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version scheduled to be released worldwide in 2020.\n\nThe story follows Vincent Brooks, a man who is beset by supernatural nightmares while torn between his feelings for longtime girlfriend Katherine and the similarly-named beauty Catherine. The gameplay is divided between the daytime, where Vincent interacts with the characters in a [[social simulation game|social simulation]], and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional towers through combined platforming and puzzle-solving. The game's ending is affected by choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.\n\n''Catherine'' was developed by the same studio behind the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, including producer and director [[Katsura Hashino]], character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]], and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game began production near the end of ''[[Persona 4]]''{{'s}} development in 2008, with the aim being to create something for a more adult audience. The English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]]. ''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, a then-newly formed division within Atlus led by Hashino. The team aimed to expand upon the original, bringing back the original cast while adding a new love interest named Rin, short for Qatherine.\n\nReception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite some criticism directed towards its difficulty. The game was nominated for several awards, and exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over one million copies worldwide by 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Catherine game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of the character Vincent navigating through a Nightmare stage]]\n''Catherine'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which players control Vincent Brooks, a man who is tormented by deadly nightmares after becoming involved with multiple women. The gameplay is divided into two parts; daytime [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] segments where Vincent interacts with various characters at the Stray Sheep bar, and nightmare segments where he navigates deadly block towers using a combination of [[Platform game|platforming]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]].<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> The game is split into three modes; the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story campaign dubbed \"Golden Playhouse\", and \"Babel\". [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]-exclusive \"Colosseum\" challenge levels are unlocked after first completing the story.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/><ref name=\"CathModes\"/>\n\nThe daytime gameplay has Vincent interacting with his girlfriends and other characters in the Stray Sheep bar.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/> During dialogue and text segments, Vincent can choose several options to respond; these include standard dialogue options and composing text messages.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"gradar_english\"/> During his time in the Stray Sheep, Vincent can Purchase drinks which help his navigation of Nightmare stages, but also impede his movement if he has too many.<ref name=\"CathDrinks\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}} He can also play a minigame titled \"Rapunzel\" which mimics the gameplay in nightmares, or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games.<ref name=\"Minigames\"/> Leaving the Stray Sheep will trigger the next Nightmare section.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}}\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. Vincent must climb towers made of blocks, which Vincent must arrange into a stairway to reach the exit. As he climbs, the tower collapses beneath him, and if he fails to arrange the blocks before the collapse reaches him, Vincent will fall and the game ends; he either restarts from the last checkpoint on the tower if Vincent has a pillow item, or the player must restart the game from their last save.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=8-9}} Blocks can be freely pushed and pulled, balanced on the edge of a similar block, and form stairways.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=10-11}} In addition to standard blocks, some blocks have additional functions such as springing Vincent higher, and some blocks are lethal traps.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> Vincent can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies, and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=16}}\n\nCompleting a stage awards a score based on the time completed and items collected. These are posted on online leader boards accessed from the game's start menu.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=6-7}} In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.<ref name=\"CathModes\"/> The game has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player during the course of the narrative.<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n\nAdditional elements were added in ''Full Body''.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/> A new mode features rearranged versions of the game's puzzles, with the original game's arrangement featuring as a separate mode.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> A new online multiplayer mode is also added, where players can enter both a randomised match or a contest with a player of equal rank.<ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> New character Rin can be called to halt the tower's collapse for a short time.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> Players can access a new difficulty level called \"Safety\", which removes all threats and time limit, and allows players to skip puzzles and continue with the story.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\nSet in an unnamed North American city, the plot of ''Catherine'' is presented as a [[story within a story]] on ''Golden Playhouse'', a television program described as \"like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' vibe\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/> The Stray Sheep, a bar where the main cast frequently meets, acts as the stage for the game's major events.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/> The game focuses on three main characters:<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/>\n* '''Vincent Brooks''', a 32-year-old systems engineer who acts as the game's protagonist and [[player character]]. Unambitious and lackadaisical, Vincent lives a stereotypical bachelor's life; he avoids the challenges of adulthood, including his uninspiring job, his run-down apartment, and his unwillingness to marry his girlfriend, Katherine.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> Vincent is voiced by [[Koichi Yamadera]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Troy Baker]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Catherine''', a 22-year-old woman. She meets Vincent at the Stray Sheep seemingly by accident, and ends up spending the night with him. This encounter, and Catherine's continued attempts to romance Vincent, become the catalyst for the game's events. Outwardly Catherine is playful, seductive, and free spirited; in reality, she is a [[succubus]] who tempts men for her own ends.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/> Catherine is voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Katherine McBride''', a 32-year-old woman working as an office manager at a clothing manufacturer. A high school friend of Vincent's, they reconnected five years prior to the game's events and began dating. Katherine wishes to marry Vincent, and is increasingly irritated by his indecisiveness.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"CathKath\"/> Katherine is voiced by [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"CathKath\"/> and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Rin''', short for '''Qatherine''', is a character exclusive to ''Full Body''. An amnesiac who plays the piano at the Stray Sheep, Rin becomes a comforting presence during Vincent's journey.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> The character is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> and Brianna Knickerbocker in English.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/>\n\nThe supporting cast includes Vincent's regular drinking partners at the Stray Sheep: Orlando Haddick ([[Hiroaki Hirata]]/[[Liam O'Brien]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), an old friend and divorcee who holds cynical views on marriage; Johnny Ariga ([[Takehito Koyasu]]/[[Travis Willingham]])<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/> an idealist searching for a soulmate; and Toby Nebbins ([[Kish\u014d Taniyama]]/[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), Johnny's co-worker who has a crush on [[Erica Anderson (character)|Erica Anderson]], ([[Junko Minagawa]]/[[Erin Fitzgerald]]<ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/><ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>) a waitress at the Stray Sheep.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersFriends\"/> Thomas Mutton ([[Norio Wakamoto]]/[[Kirk Thornton]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), nicknamed \"Boss\", is the owner of the Stray Sheep. The game is narrated by Trisha,{{efn|Known in Japanese as {{nihongo|Rue Ishida|\u77f3\u7530\u2606\u30eb\u30a6|Ishida R\u016b}}}} (Junko Minagawa/Erin Fitzgerald<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/><ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>) who is the host of ''Golden Playhouse'' dubbed the \"Midnight Venus\".<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nVincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying his longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a [[one-night stand]] which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life. The stress of his [[double life]] and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually compel Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine \u2014 who has retained no memory of the nightmare, but having discovered his [[infidelity]] \u2014 breaks off their relationship.<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nVincent realizes he is the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], and that Catherine is a succubus who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare world one last time, on the condition that he and the other men will be freed if he reaches the top of the tower. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of [[Astaroth]].<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nIn ''Full Body'', Rin moves in next door to Vincent after taking a job at the Stray Sheep playing piano. Vincent and Rin grow close, with Rin comforting him in his nightmares by playing the piano. During one meeting, Vincent accidentally discovers that Rin is a [[otokonoko|cross-dressing man]], which causes a rift between them following Vincent's shocked reaction. If Vincent chooses to reconnect with Rin, he appears in Vincent's nightmare and is captured by Mutton, with Vincent rescuing him by defeating Astaroth. Alternate endings for Katherine and Catherine are unlocked if Vincent sends them a recording of Rin's piano music.\n\nFrom here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player's actions throughout the game:\n*'''Katherine Ending:''' Vincent meets with Katherine, and asks her to take him back. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she forgives him after Mutton and Vincent's friends reveal his ordeal. In the \"true\" ending, they are married. In the ''Full Body'' ending, Katherine again leaves Vincent, gaining new self-confidence while fondly remembering her time with Vincent.\n*'''Catherine Ending:''' Vincent summons Catherine, and asks to marry her. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she accepts; they live together in [[Hell]] despite the objections of [[Nergal]], the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the \"true\" ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell with Catherine as his queen. In the ''Full Body'' version, Catherine transports Vincent back to his high school days and appears as a human, allowing them to fall in love and start a family.\n*'''Freedom Ending:''' Vincent realizes he does not desire marriage. Having won against Mutton, he demands payment from him, which he immediately uses to bet on a wrestling match. In the \"good\" ending, he loses the bet. In the \"true\" ending, he wins and uses the money to fulfill his dream of [[Space tourism|visiting outer space]].\n*'''Rin Ending:''' In the \"bad\" ending, Rin leaves while wishing Vincent the best following Astaroth's defeat. In the \"good\" ending, Rin is revealed to be part of an alien race of \"[[angel]]s\" after his brother challenges Vincent to a final challenge to determine mankind's fate; Vincent wins, and he and Rin become a couple. In the \"true\" ending, Rin performs a piano concert for humans and many alien races, with Vincent as his producer and partner.\n\nIn all of the game's endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that the tower was a [[Hero's journey|metaphor for the journey to adulthood]], and that \"there is no right way to climb the tower.\"<ref name=\"CathBook\"/> In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game's challenge stages, Trisha [[Breaking the fourth wall|speaks directly to the player]] and reveals that she is [[Ishtar]], with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Tired of Dumuzid's infidelity, the events of ''Catherine'' were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Catherine XBox 360 Japan.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Uncensored Xbox 360 cover art featuring Katherine. The differing covers of the 360 and PS3 versions were intended to catch consumer eyes in stores, and exemplify the contrasting appeal of the two heroines.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/>]]\n''Catherine'' was developed by the \"2nd Creative Production Department\", a team within [[Atlus]] who had previously handled development for the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, a subseries within the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise.<ref name=\"CatherineDev\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/> Planning for ''Catherine'' began while the development team were performing final polishing work for ''[[Persona 4]]'' prior to the latter's 2008 release.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> The three key staff members were all veterans of the ''Persona'' series: director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]] had helmed both ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''Persona 4''; art director and character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] had designed characters for both ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''; and composer [[Shoji Meguro]] had created music for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' titles, including the ''Persona'' series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the chief programmer was Yujiro Kosaka.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was the very first title developed by Atlus for [[High-definition video|high-definition]] (HD) [[video game console]]s, specifically the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) and [[Xbox 360]] (360).<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Using HD consoles they were able to fully portray the world of ''Catherine''. Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that ''Catherine'' was a \"difficult\" game for the company to make.<ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/> The game would later be called a \"test\" for the development of ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms.<ref name=\"CathAnnounced\"/> Upon its announcement, ''Catherine'' proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] ratings board.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began an \"aggressive\" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan.<ref name=\"SilHashino\"/> ''Catherine'' released on February 17, 2011.<ref name=\"CathDateJP\"/> A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads.<ref name=\"CathJPDemo\"/> Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March.<ref name=\"CathJPpatchPS3\"/><ref name=\"CathJPpatch360\"/> The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.<ref name=\"CathAsiaRelease\"/>\n\nDifferent cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions\u2014the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/> This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risqu\u00e9.<ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in ''Persona 3 Portable'', the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona 3''. The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersonaSil\"/> Vincent was included in ''Persona 3 Portable'' as it was created by the same development team as ''Catherine'', but the version of Vincent in ''Persona 3 Portable'' is not the same as that used in ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersona3\"/> Despite the possibility, staff have discounted either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to its challenging production.<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/><ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\nThe aim with ''Catherine'' was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> It used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> Hashino had wanted an in-house engine, but the team's lack of experience with HD consoles meant this was impracticable.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> While they had the option of developing the title for [[Handheld game console|handheld consoles]] or [[mobile device]]s, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/>\n\nThe initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The scenario's main writer was Yuichiro Tanaka, previously lead writer for the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathWriter\"/> The setting incorporated both Japanese and American influences.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/> Hashino felt that ''Catherine'' was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Vincent was a very unlikeable character, but based on staff feedback he was adjusted to appear more sympathetic. As the initial premise could not be changed, the team instead added Mutton's plot and worked to make Vincent a more sympathetic character within this framework.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/>\n\nSoejima, who had mainly worked on the ''Persona'' series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures.<ref name=\"CathSoejima1\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes.<ref name=\"CathSoejima2\"/> Vincent's character was based on and named after [[Vincent Gallo]], specifically his appearance in the 1998 film ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. The younger \"Catherine\" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to \"Katherine\", who had an adult charm.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The pink coloring of the game's [[user interface]] was intended to evoke its sensual and \"kitschy\" atmosphere.<ref name=\"CathUI\"/> The cutscenes were created by anime production studio [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/> While the ''Persona'' games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in ''Catherine'' came to considerably more. Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/>\n\n===Localization===\n''Catherine'' was initially not planned for a Western release.<ref name=\"CathJPexclusive\"/> After an initial leak through listings on [[EB Games]] and [[Gamestop]], [[Atlus USA]] confirmed that ''Catherine'' would be released in North America.<ref name=\"SilCathUSannounced\"/> The game was localized for the West by Atlus USA, who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and [[quality assurance]] staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/> Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem \"[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/>\n\nA major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including [[Douglas Adams]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. According to Chan, the main advantage of ''Catherine'' compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nAtlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]] to take ''Catherine'' due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an \"adult\" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified [[AAA (video game industry)|triple-A]] games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than ''Catherine''. When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that ''Catherine'' had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed ''Catherine'' to be sold in mainstream stores, while also looking through their stocks after seeing the content of currently-stocked titles.<ref name=\"CathWestStores\"/> As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions, and alternate versions of those covers toning down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers.<ref name=\"SilCathCoversWest\"/> ''Catherine'' released in North America on July 26, 2011.<ref name=\"CathUSDate\"/> In addition to the standard edition, a special limited \"Love is Dead\" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.<ref name=\"CathNAcollectors\"/>\n\nThough initial statements from Atlus said that ''Catherine'' would not be released in Europe,<ref name=\"CathEUdetails\"/> its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany.<ref name=\"CathEUleak\"/> Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by [[Deep Silver]] across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game.<ref name=\"CathEUannounced\"/> ''Catherine'' released in Europe on February 10, 2012.<ref name=\"CathEUdate\"/> As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the \"Stray Sheep Edition\" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition.<ref name=\"CathEUcollectors\"/> In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software.<ref name=\"CathAUqv\"/> The PS3 version released on February 16,<ref name=\"QVcathPS3\"/> while the 360 version released on February 23.<ref name=\"QVcath360\"/>  A [[Microsoft Windows]] version, titled ''Catherine Classic'', was published worldwide by [[Sega]] on January 10, 2019 through [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"CatherinePCdate\"/> This port was the first modern Atlus title ported to the platform, as the company were previously averse to it. The port included expanded graphics options, controller customization, and the English and Japanese voice tracks.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/>\n\nSince release, ''Catherine'' has occasionally been played competitively in [[esport]] tournaments. The game's professional scene began when [[Fighting game community|FGC]] member David \"Dacidbro\" Broweleit desired to learn the insides of the game's engine.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/> The first notable tournament was an event called Super NorCal Install, which took place in 2012. The tournament would become the basis for the game's competitive scene.<ref name=\"RBComp\"/> Publisher [[Atlus]] would later officially sponsor the game as a side event at [[Evo 2015]], while streaming it on their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] account.<ref name=\"PolyEsports\"/> The attention surrounding the event would later carry on into [[Evo 2016]], [[Community Effort Orlando|CEOtaku 2016]], [[Genesis (tournament)|Genesis 4]], as well as a dedicated event in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] called ''The King of Catherine'', which had awarded a {{USD}}5,000 prize pool to winners.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/><ref name=\"CathGenesis\"/><ref name=\"CathKing\"/> Speaking later, the developers said they were surprised with how popular the game became in the international esports scene.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\n====Voice cast====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| footer    = [[Troy Baker]] (left) and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (right) were the respective English voices for Vincent and Catherine.

Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/> Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nBaker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the ''Persona'' series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in ''Persona 3'' while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced [[Kanji Tatsumi]] and Rise Kujikawa from ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/><ref name=\"BaileyRise\"/> In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in ''Catherine'' were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine.<ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n\nRuff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to \"pull it off\".<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n\n===''Catherine: Full Body''===\n\n''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, an internal team founded by Hashino after the release of ''[[Persona 5]]'' with multiple ''Persona'' staff. Hashino envisioned the game as the definitive version of ''Catherine'', the aim being to present the team's mission to create new and innovative gaming experiences by returning to one of their more unconventional titles.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino and Soejima returned as producer and character designer respectively. The director was Kenichi Goto, who worked as battle planner for the [[PlayStation 2]] ''Devil Summoner'' games and ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C returned to produce twenty more anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The game was ported directly into the in-house ''Persona 5'' engine.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The gameplay was tweaked based on fan feedback, and easier difficulty was added so players could enjoy the story.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> The game includes [[downloadable content]] (DLC) that features ''Persona 5'' protagonist [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] as a playable guest character.<ref name=\"FullDLCjoker\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Jeremy |title=E3 2019: Persona 5 Characters Join Catherine: Full Body |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616084416/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe keyword for the project was \"diversity\", expressed in both the narrative and the unconventional gameplay compared to other titles on the market.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Rin was included in ''Full Body'' as part of Hashino's wish to update the game's sensibilities and subject matter based on current trends.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> When asked to create a third \"Catherine\", Soejima was initially unsure how to proceed. As he designed Catherine and Katherine as \"hot\" and \"cool\" respectively, he chose a \"cute\" design for Rin.<ref name=\"SilSoejima\"/> Soejima designed Rin around a lack of aggression, from the character's expression and coloring reflecting this.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino also asked Soejima to redesign Trisha's hairstyle, which was changed into twin bun-style afros on either side of her head.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was released in Japan on February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateJP\"/> A notable addition to the Japanese version was a choice of eleven different voice actresses for Catherine, nine of which were DLC. All the actresses had previously played adulterous characters.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The voices available in the base game were the original voice Sawashiro and [[Mamiko Noto]]. The Japanese DLC actresses were [[Ami Koshimizu]], [[Aoi Y\u016bki]], [[Yui Horie]], [[Kana Asumi]], [[Haruka Tomatsu]], [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], [[Rie Kugimiya]], [[Rina Sat\u014d]], and [[Nana Mizuki]].<ref name=\"FullVoices\"/> Each actress portrayed Catherine in a different way, with Noto's version being described as a \"[[yandere]] lady\".<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/>\n\nThe original English voice cast reprised their roles for new dialogue, with Brianna Knickerbocker voicing the character of Rin.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/> The localization team had to translate roughly 165,000 Japanese characters and over 6,000 new lines of spoken dialogue. As the original script altered several established lines, the team constantly referenced the Japanese script and worked hard to smoothly incorporate new and original text.  While the team could have recast due to the lapse of time between the original and ''Full Body'', the team wanted to \"preserve the integrity\" of ''Full Body'' and so brought back the entire main cast and most of the supporting cast. There were problems with how some voices had aged over the past eight years, and due to concerns over Baker's voice the team opted not to re-record a scene where Vincent screamed for 20 seconds.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|title=Bringing Catherine: Full Body to Life in English|last=Stebel|first=Jonathon|website=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=September 4, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906041523/https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|archivedate=September 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A notable adjustment for the Western release of ''Full Body'' was the crediting and dialogue for the transgender character Erica. She was originally referred to in the English credits using her birth name with her chosen name in parentheses. The Japanese version of ''Full Body'' retained this, but Atlus changed it for the Western release to use Erica's chosen name. This is notable because the game appeared in the news following public debate over whether the original credits were [[transphobic]].<ref name=\"ANNfullbody\"/> Some dialogue within the game related to Erica was also changed for similar reasons.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The PS4 version was released by Atlus in North America and Europe on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateWW\"/> For the European version, the localizers had the extra task of translating the text into French, Spanish, Italian and German.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\"/> The lack of an English localization for the Vita version was attributed to the console's discontinuation outside of Japan that year.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was announced during a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2020, and will be released on July 7, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minotti |first1=Mike |title=Catherine: Full Body is coming to Switch on July 7 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/26/catherine-full-body-is-coming-to-switch-on-july-7/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nMeguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes.<ref name=\"MeguroCathLiners\"/> Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about What he wanted the music to be like, giving him the key words of \"classic\", \"adult oriented\" and \"erotic\".<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> The music team used multiple genres for the music in ''Catherine'', switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of [[classical music]], quiet moments used [[jazz]], and the animated cutscenes used symphonic-based music.<ref name=\"CathShoji2\"/> As the animated cutscenes were produced by an external company, Meguro found creating music for them difficult when compared to previous projects of his, as he had to sync the music to something he had no creative input with.<ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work, and the amount of control he had to adjust the relative volume of music and sound effects.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Rapper L-VOKAL contributed to the score.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\nFor ''Full Body'', in addition to Meguro's original work on the score, music company Inspion Izene was brought on to both arrange and add to the soundtrack.

The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan and North America in 2011, in [[PAL region]]s by [[Deep Silver]] in 2012, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] by [[Sega]] in 2019. A re-release with additional content, titled '''''Catherine: Full Body''''',{{efn|{{nihongo||\u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30d5\u30eb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3|Kyasarin: Furu Bodi}}}} was released in 2019 for the [[PlayStation 4]] worldwide and for the [[PlayStation Vita]] only in Japan, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version scheduled to be released worldwide in 2020.\n\nThe story follows Vincent Brooks, a man who is beset by supernatural nightmares while torn between his feelings for longtime girlfriend Katherine and the similarly-named beauty Catherine. The gameplay is divided between the daytime, where Vincent interacts with the characters in a [[social simulation game|social simulation]], and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional towers through combined platforming and puzzle-solving. The game's ending is affected by choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.\n\n''Catherine'' was developed by the same studio behind the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, including producer and director [[Katsura Hashino]], character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]], and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game began production near the end of ''[[Persona 4]]''{{'s}} development in 2008, with the aim being to create something for a more adult audience. The English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]]. ''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, a then-newly formed division within Atlus led by Hashino. The team aimed to expand upon the original, bringing back the original cast while adding a new love interest named Rin, short for Qatherine.\n\nReception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite some criticism directed towards its difficulty. The game was nominated for several awards, and exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over one million copies worldwide by 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Catherine game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of the character Vincent navigating through a Nightmare stage]]\n''Catherine'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which players control Vincent Brooks, a man who is tormented by deadly nightmares after becoming involved with multiple women. The gameplay is divided into two parts; daytime [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] segments where Vincent interacts with various characters at the Stray Sheep bar, and nightmare segments where he navigates deadly block towers using a combination of [[Platform game|platforming]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]].<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> The game is split into three modes; the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story campaign dubbed \"Golden Playhouse\", and \"Babel\". [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]-exclusive \"Colosseum\" challenge levels are unlocked after first completing the story.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/><ref name=\"CathModes\"/>\n\nThe daytime gameplay has Vincent interacting with his girlfriends and other characters in the Stray Sheep bar.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/> During dialogue and text segments, Vincent can choose several options to respond; these include standard dialogue options and composing text messages.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"gradar_english\"/> During his time in the Stray Sheep, Vincent can Purchase drinks which help his navigation of Nightmare stages, but also impede his movement if he has too many.<ref name=\"CathDrinks\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}} He can also play a minigame titled \"Rapunzel\" which mimics the gameplay in nightmares, or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games.<ref name=\"Minigames\"/> Leaving the Stray Sheep will trigger the next Nightmare section.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}}\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. Vincent must climb towers made of blocks, which Vincent must arrange into a stairway to reach the exit. As he climbs, the tower collapses beneath him, and if he fails to arrange the blocks before the collapse reaches him, Vincent will fall and the game ends; he either restarts from the last checkpoint on the tower if Vincent has a pillow item, or the player must restart the game from their last save.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=8-9}} Blocks can be freely pushed and pulled, balanced on the edge of a similar block, and form stairways.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=10-11}} In addition to standard blocks, some blocks have additional functions such as springing Vincent higher, and some blocks are lethal traps.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> Vincent can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies, and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=16}}\n\nCompleting a stage awards a score based on the time completed and items collected. These are posted on online leader boards accessed from the game's start menu.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=6-7}} In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.<ref name=\"CathModes\"/> The game has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player during the course of the narrative.<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n\nAdditional elements were added in ''Full Body''.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/> A new mode features rearranged versions of the game's puzzles, with the original game's arrangement featuring as a separate mode.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> A new online multiplayer mode is also added, where players can enter both a randomised match or a contest with a player of equal rank.<ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> New character Rin can be called to halt the tower's collapse for a short time.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> Players can access a new difficulty level called \"Safety\", which removes all threats and time limit, and allows players to skip puzzles and continue with the story.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\nSet in an unnamed North American city, the plot of ''Catherine'' is presented as a [[story within a story]] on ''Golden Playhouse'', a television program described as \"like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' vibe\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/> The Stray Sheep, a bar where the main cast frequently meets, acts as the stage for the game's major events.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/> The game focuses on three main characters:<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/>\n* '''Vincent Brooks''', a 32-year-old systems engineer who acts as the game's protagonist and [[player character]]. Unambitious and lackadaisical, Vincent lives a stereotypical bachelor's life; he avoids the challenges of adulthood, including his uninspiring job, his run-down apartment, and his unwillingness to marry his girlfriend, Katherine.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> Vincent is voiced by [[Koichi Yamadera]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Troy Baker]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Catherine''', a 22-year-old woman. She meets Vincent at the Stray Sheep seemingly by accident, and ends up spending the night with him. This encounter, and Catherine's continued attempts to romance Vincent, become the catalyst for the game's events. Outwardly Catherine is playful, seductive, and free spirited; in reality, she is a [[succubus]] who tempts men for her own ends.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/> Catherine is voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Katherine McBride''', a 32-year-old woman working as an office manager at a clothing manufacturer. A high school friend of Vincent's, they reconnected five years prior to the game's events and began dating. Katherine wishes to marry Vincent, and is increasingly irritated by his indecisiveness.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"CathKath\"/> Katherine is voiced by [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"CathKath\"/> and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Rin''', short for '''Qatherine''', is a character exclusive to ''Full Body''. An amnesiac who plays the piano at the Stray Sheep, Rin becomes a comforting presence during Vincent's journey.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> The character is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> and Brianna Knickerbocker in English.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/>\n\nThe supporting cast includes Vincent's regular drinking partners at the Stray Sheep: Orlando Haddick ([[Hiroaki Hirata]]/[[Liam O'Brien]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), an old friend and divorcee who holds cynical views on marriage; Johnny Ariga ([[Takehito Koyasu]]/[[Travis Willingham]])<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/> an idealist searching for a soulmate; and Toby Nebbins ([[Kish\u014d Taniyama]]/[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), Johnny's co-worker who has a crush on [[Erica Anderson (character)|Erica Anderson]], ([[Junko Minagawa]]/[[Erin Fitzgerald]]<ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/><ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>) a waitress at the Stray Sheep.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersFriends\"/> Thomas Mutton ([[Norio Wakamoto]]/[[Kirk Thornton]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), nicknamed \"Boss\", is the owner of the Stray Sheep. The game is narrated by Trisha,{{efn|Known in Japanese as {{nihongo|Rue Ishida|\u77f3\u7530\u2606\u30eb\u30a6|Ishida R\u016b}}}} (Junko Minagawa/Erin Fitzgerald<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/><ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>) who is the host of ''Golden Playhouse'' dubbed the \"Midnight Venus\".<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nVincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying his longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a [[one-night stand]] which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life. The stress of his [[double life]] and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually compel Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine \u2014 who has retained no memory of the nightmare, but having discovered his [[infidelity]] \u2014 breaks off their relationship.<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nVincent realizes he is the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], and that Catherine is a succubus who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare world one last time, on the condition that he and the other men will be freed if he reaches the top of the tower. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of [[Astaroth]].<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nIn ''Full Body'', Rin moves in next door to Vincent after taking a job at the Stray Sheep playing piano. Vincent and Rin grow close, with Rin comforting him in his nightmares by playing the piano. During one meeting, Vincent accidentally discovers that Rin is a [[otokonoko|cross-dressing man]], which causes a rift between them following Vincent's shocked reaction. If Vincent chooses to reconnect with Rin, he appears in Vincent's nightmare and is captured by Mutton, with Vincent rescuing him by defeating Astaroth. Alternate endings for Katherine and Catherine are unlocked if Vincent sends them a recording of Rin's piano music.\n\nFrom here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player's actions throughout the game:\n*'''Katherine Ending:''' Vincent meets with Katherine, and asks her to take him back. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she forgives him after Mutton and Vincent's friends reveal his ordeal. In the \"true\" ending, they are married. In the ''Full Body'' ending, Katherine again leaves Vincent, gaining new self-confidence while fondly remembering her time with Vincent.\n*'''Catherine Ending:''' Vincent summons Catherine, and asks to marry her. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she accepts; they live together in [[Hell]] despite the objections of [[Nergal]], the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the \"true\" ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell with Catherine as his queen. In the ''Full Body'' version, Catherine transports Vincent back to his high school days and appears as a human, allowing them to fall in love and start a family.\n*'''Freedom Ending:''' Vincent realizes he does not desire marriage. Having won against Mutton, he demands payment from him, which he immediately uses to bet on a wrestling match. In the \"good\" ending, he loses the bet. In the \"true\" ending, he wins and uses the money to fulfill his dream of [[Space tourism|visiting outer space]].\n*'''Rin Ending:''' In the \"bad\" ending, Rin leaves while wishing Vincent the best following Astaroth's defeat. In the \"good\" ending, Rin is revealed to be part of an alien race of \"[[angel]]s\" after his brother challenges Vincent to a final challenge to determine mankind's fate; Vincent wins, and he and Rin become a couple. In the \"true\" ending, Rin performs a piano concert for humans and many alien races, with Vincent as his producer and partner.\n\nIn all of the game's endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that the tower was a [[Hero's journey|metaphor for the journey to adulthood]], and that \"there is no right way to climb the tower.\"<ref name=\"CathBook\"/> In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game's challenge stages, Trisha [[Breaking the fourth wall|speaks directly to the player]] and reveals that she is [[Ishtar]], with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Tired of Dumuzid's infidelity, the events of ''Catherine'' were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Catherine XBox 360 Japan.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Uncensored Xbox 360 cover art featuring Katherine. The differing covers of the 360 and PS3 versions were intended to catch consumer eyes in stores, and exemplify the contrasting appeal of the two heroines.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/>]]\n''Catherine'' was developed by the \"2nd Creative Production Department\", a team within [[Atlus]] who had previously handled development for the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, a subseries within the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise.<ref name=\"CatherineDev\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/> Planning for ''Catherine'' began while the development team were performing final polishing work for ''[[Persona 4]]'' prior to the latter's 2008 release.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> The three key staff members were all veterans of the ''Persona'' series: director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]] had helmed both ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''Persona 4''; art director and character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] had designed characters for both ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''; and composer [[Shoji Meguro]] had created music for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' titles, including the ''Persona'' series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the chief programmer was Yujiro Kosaka.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was the very first title developed by Atlus for [[High-definition video|high-definition]] (HD) [[video game console]]s, specifically the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) and [[Xbox 360]] (360).<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Using HD consoles they were able to fully portray the world of ''Catherine''. Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that ''Catherine'' was a \"difficult\" game for the company to make.<ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/> The game would later be called a \"test\" for the development of ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms.<ref name=\"CathAnnounced\"/> Upon its announcement, ''Catherine'' proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] ratings board.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began an \"aggressive\" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan.<ref name=\"SilHashino\"/> ''Catherine'' released on February 17, 2011.<ref name=\"CathDateJP\"/> A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads.<ref name=\"CathJPDemo\"/> Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March.<ref name=\"CathJPpatchPS3\"/><ref name=\"CathJPpatch360\"/> The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.<ref name=\"CathAsiaRelease\"/>\n\nDifferent cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions\u2014the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/> This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risqu\u00e9.<ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in ''Persona 3 Portable'', the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona 3''. The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersonaSil\"/> Vincent was included in ''Persona 3 Portable'' as it was created by the same development team as ''Catherine'', but the version of Vincent in ''Persona 3 Portable'' is not the same as that used in ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersona3\"/> Despite the possibility, staff have discounted either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to its challenging production.<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/><ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\nThe aim with ''Catherine'' was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> It used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> Hashino had wanted an in-house engine, but the team's lack of experience with HD consoles meant this was impracticable.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> While they had the option of developing the title for [[Handheld game console|handheld consoles]] or [[mobile device]]s, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/>\n\nThe initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The scenario's main writer was Yuichiro Tanaka, previously lead writer for the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathWriter\"/> The setting incorporated both Japanese and American influences.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/> Hashino felt that ''Catherine'' was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Vincent was a very unlikeable character, but based on staff feedback he was adjusted to appear more sympathetic. As the initial premise could not be changed, the team instead added Mutton's plot and worked to make Vincent a more sympathetic character within this framework.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/>\n\nSoejima, who had mainly worked on the ''Persona'' series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures.<ref name=\"CathSoejima1\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes.<ref name=\"CathSoejima2\"/> Vincent's character was based on and named after [[Vincent Gallo]], specifically his appearance in the 1998 film ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. The younger \"Catherine\" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to \"Katherine\", who had an adult charm.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The pink coloring of the game's [[user interface]] was intended to evoke its sensual and \"kitschy\" atmosphere.<ref name=\"CathUI\"/> The cutscenes were created by anime production studio [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/> While the ''Persona'' games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in ''Catherine'' came to considerably more. Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/>\n\n===Localization===\n''Catherine'' was initially not planned for a Western release.<ref name=\"CathJPexclusive\"/> After an initial leak through listings on [[EB Games]] and [[Gamestop]], [[Atlus USA]] confirmed that ''Catherine'' would be released in North America.<ref name=\"SilCathUSannounced\"/> The game was localized for the West by Atlus USA, who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and [[quality assurance]] staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/> Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem \"[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/>\n\nA major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including [[Douglas Adams]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. According to Chan, the main advantage of ''Catherine'' compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nAtlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]] to take ''Catherine'' due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an \"adult\" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified [[AAA (video game industry)|triple-A]] games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than ''Catherine''. When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that ''Catherine'' had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed ''Catherine'' to be sold in mainstream stores, while also looking through their stocks after seeing the content of currently-stocked titles.<ref name=\"CathWestStores\"/> As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions, and alternate versions of those covers toning down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers.<ref name=\"SilCathCoversWest\"/> ''Catherine'' released in North America on July 26, 2011.<ref name=\"CathUSDate\"/> In addition to the standard edition, a special limited \"Love is Dead\" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.<ref name=\"CathNAcollectors\"/>\n\nThough initial statements from Atlus said that ''Catherine'' would not be released in Europe,<ref name=\"CathEUdetails\"/> its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany.<ref name=\"CathEUleak\"/> Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by [[Deep Silver]] across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game.<ref name=\"CathEUannounced\"/> ''Catherine'' released in Europe on February 10, 2012.<ref name=\"CathEUdate\"/> As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the \"Stray Sheep Edition\" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition.<ref name=\"CathEUcollectors\"/> In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software.<ref name=\"CathAUqv\"/> The PS3 version released on February 16,<ref name=\"QVcathPS3\"/> while the 360 version released on February 23.<ref name=\"QVcath360\"/>  A [[Microsoft Windows]] version, titled ''Catherine Classic'', was published worldwide by [[Sega]] on January 10, 2019 through [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"CatherinePCdate\"/> This port was the first modern Atlus title ported to the platform, as the company were previously averse to it. The port included expanded graphics options, controller customization, and the English and Japanese voice tracks.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/>\n\nSince release, ''Catherine'' has occasionally been played competitively in [[esport]] tournaments. The game's professional scene began when [[Fighting game community|FGC]] member David \"Dacidbro\" Broweleit desired to learn the insides of the game's engine.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/> The first notable tournament was an event called Super NorCal Install, which took place in 2012. The tournament would become the basis for the game's competitive scene.<ref name=\"RBComp\"/> Publisher [[Atlus]] would later officially sponsor the game as a side event at [[Evo 2015]], while streaming it on their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] account.<ref name=\"PolyEsports\"/> The attention surrounding the event would later carry on into [[Evo 2016]], [[Community Effort Orlando|CEOtaku 2016]], [[Genesis (tournament)|Genesis 4]], as well as a dedicated event in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] called ''The King of Catherine'', which had awarded a {{USD}}5,000 prize pool to winners.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/><ref name=\"CathGenesis\"/><ref name=\"CathKing\"/> Speaking later, the developers said they were surprised with how popular the game became in the international esports scene.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\n====Voice cast====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| footer    = [[Troy Baker]] (left) and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (right) were the respective English voices for Vincent and Catherine.

Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/> Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nBaker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the ''Persona'' series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in ''Persona 3'' while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced [[Kanji Tatsumi]] and Rise Kujikawa from ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/><ref name=\"BaileyRise\"/> In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in ''Catherine'' were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine.<ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n\nRuff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to \"pull it off\".<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n\n===''Catherine: Full Body''===\n\n''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, an internal team founded by Hashino after the release of ''[[Persona 5]]'' with multiple ''Persona'' staff. Hashino envisioned the game as the definitive version of ''Catherine'', the aim being to present the team's mission to create new and innovative gaming experiences by returning to one of their more unconventional titles.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino and Soejima returned as producer and character designer respectively. The director was Kenichi Goto, who worked as battle planner for the [[PlayStation 2]] ''Devil Summoner'' games and ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C returned to produce twenty more anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The game was ported directly into the in-house ''Persona 5'' engine.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The gameplay was tweaked based on fan feedback, and easier difficulty was added so players could enjoy the story.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> The game includes [[downloadable content]] (DLC) that features ''Persona 5'' protagonist [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] as a playable guest character.<ref name=\"FullDLCjoker\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Jeremy |title=E3 2019: Persona 5 Characters Join Catherine: Full Body |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616084416/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe keyword for the project was \"diversity\", expressed in both the narrative and the unconventional gameplay compared to other titles on the market.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Rin was included in ''Full Body'' as part of Hashino's wish to update the game's sensibilities and subject matter based on current trends.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> When asked to create a third \"Catherine\", Soejima was initially unsure how to proceed. As he designed Catherine and Katherine as \"hot\" and \"cool\" respectively, he chose a \"cute\" design for Rin.<ref name=\"SilSoejima\"/> Soejima designed Rin around a lack of aggression, from the character's expression and coloring reflecting this.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino also asked Soejima to redesign Trisha's hairstyle, which was changed into twin bun-style afros on either side of her head.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was released in Japan on February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateJP\"/> A notable addition to the Japanese version was a choice of eleven different voice actresses for Catherine, nine of which were DLC. All the actresses had previously played adulterous characters.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The voices available in the base game were the original voice Sawashiro and [[Mamiko Noto]]. The Japanese DLC actresses were [[Ami Koshimizu]], [[Aoi Y\u016bki]], [[Yui Horie]], [[Kana Asumi]], [[Haruka Tomatsu]], [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], [[Rie Kugimiya]], [[Rina Sat\u014d]], and [[Nana Mizuki]].<ref name=\"FullVoices\"/> Each actress portrayed Catherine in a different way, with Noto's version being described as a \"[[yandere]] lady\".<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/>\n\nThe original English voice cast reprised their roles for new dialogue, with Brianna Knickerbocker voicing the character of Rin.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/> The localization team had to translate roughly 165,000 Japanese characters and over 6,000 new lines of spoken dialogue. As the original script altered several established lines, the team constantly referenced the Japanese script and worked hard to smoothly incorporate new and original text.  While the team could have recast due to the lapse of time between the original and ''Full Body'', the team wanted to \"preserve the integrity\" of ''Full Body'' and so brought back the entire main cast and most of the supporting cast. There were problems with how some voices had aged over the past eight years, and due to concerns over Baker's voice the team opted not to re-record a scene where Vincent screamed for 20 seconds.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|title=Bringing Catherine: Full Body to Life in English|last=Stebel|first=Jonathon|website=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=September 4, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906041523/https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|archivedate=September 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A notable adjustment for the Western release of ''Full Body'' was the crediting and dialogue for the transgender character Erica. She was originally referred to in the English credits using her birth name with her chosen name in parentheses. The Japanese version of ''Full Body'' retained this, but Atlus changed it for the Western release to use Erica's chosen name. This is notable because the game appeared in the news following public debate over whether the original credits were [[transphobic]].<ref name=\"ANNfullbody\"/> Some dialogue within the game related to Erica was also changed for similar reasons.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The PS4 version was released by Atlus in North America and Europe on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateWW\"/> For the European version, the localizers had the extra task of translating the text into French, Spanish, Italian and German.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\"/> The lack of an English localization for the Vita version was attributed to the console's discontinuation outside of Japan that year.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was annouced during a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2020, and will be released on July 7, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minotti |first1=Mike |title=Catherine: Full Body is coming to Switch on July 7 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/26/catherine-full-body-is-coming-to-switch-on-july-7/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nMeguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes.<ref name=\"MeguroCathLiners\"/> Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about What he wanted the music to be like, giving him the key words of \"classic\", \"adult oriented\" and \"erotic\".<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> The music team used multiple genres for the music in ''Catherine'', switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of [[classical music]], quiet moments used [[jazz]], and the animated cutscenes used symphonic-based music.<ref name=\"CathShoji2\"/> As the animated cutscenes were produced by an external company, Meguro found creating music for them difficult when compared to previous projects of his, as he had to sync the music to something he had no creative input with.<ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work, and the amount of control he had to adjust the relative volume of music and sound effects.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Rapper L-VOKAL contributed to the score.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\nFor ''Full Body'', in addition to Meguro's original work on the score, music company Inspion Izene was brought on to both arrange and add to the soundtrack. The company had previously helped with the original game's sound design, and were brought in to help distinguish the game's sound from that of the ''Persona'' series and its parent ''Megami Tensei''.<ref name=\"SoundInterview\"/> L-VOKAL returned to help remix tracks.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/> Inspion Izene composed seventeen new tracks for the game.<ref name=\"SoundInterview\"/> The theme song for the game is \"Re:set\" by [[Sekai no Owari]].<ref name=\"FullTheme\"/> The theme was performed by Chinese singer Satsuki; the team wanted a voice that would stand out, so they sought out a foreign singer who could speak Japanese.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|MC = (X360) 82/100<ref name=\"mc_360\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/catherine |title=Catherine for Xbox 360 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820145250/http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/catherine |archivedate=August 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref><br />(PS3) 79/100<ref name=\"mc_ps3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/catherine |title=Catherine for PlayStation 3 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819220835/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/catherine |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><br />(PC) 80/100<ref name=\"mc_pc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/catherine-classic |title=Catherine Classic for PC Reviews - Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=January 10, 2019 |accessdate=April 29, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319144909/https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/catherine-classic |archive-date=March 19, 2019 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n|CVG = 8/10<ref name=\"GAVG\"/>\n|GRadar = 8/10<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n|GSpot = 8.5/10<ref name=\"gspot_catherine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/catherine/review.html |title=Catherine Review, Catherine Xbox 360 Review |publisher=GameSpot.com |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820042942/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/catherine/review.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n|GT = 7.8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/game/catherine/13734 |title=Catherine Video Game &#124;

The station is part of the [[Saskatoon Media Group]] and has studios with sister stations [[CJWW]] and [[CJMK-FM]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe station originated on the [[AM radio|AM]] dial as '''CFQC-AM''', which began broadcasting in 1923. It was founded by electrical supply shop owners A. A. \"Pappy\" Murphy and David Streb. Murphy bought out Streb in 1932.\n\nThe station was an affiliate of the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] from 1933 to 1936 when it affiliated with the newly formed [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. It lost that affiliation in 1939 when the CBC signed on [[CBK (AM)|CBK]] as its outlet for all of southern and central Saskatchewan. In 1944 it became an affiliate of the CBC's [[Dominion Network]] until 1962 when the network was reabsorbed into the main [[CBC Radio]] network and CFQC became independent. In 1954, [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] was established by the Murphy family and became Saskatoon's first television station; initially a CBC affiliate, in the early 1970s it switched to the [[CTV Television Network]]. Both the TV and radio stations shared some on-air personnel such as newsreaders.\n\nPappy Murphy died in 1959. His family sold CFQC-AM and TV to [[CTVglobemedia|Baton Broadcasting]] in 1972, earning a handsome return on its original investment of 49 years earlier. Baton exited radio in 1991, selling CFQC to George Gallagher, at which point the radio station's ties to its TV namesake all but ended. However, only two years later, Gallagher was forced into receivership. Clint Forster, owner of [[CJWW]], bought CFQC in 1994 and announced plans to move it to the FM band.\n\nOn February 6, 1995, at 6:06&nbsp;a.m., CFQC left its longtime AM position at 600 and was replaced by CJWW, which moved from 750 AM. The last song played on \"Hits 600\" was \"Stand Tall\" by Burton Cummings.\n\nAt 7:00AM that day, CFQC-FM signed on at 92.9 FM,<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1994/DB94-694.HTM Decision CRTC 94-694]</ref> where it was rebranded Hot93 and switched from adult contemporary to country music, complementing CJWW's classic country format. Current owner Elmer Hildebrand bought the station in 2001. CFQC and its brand Hot 93 were retired at 6:00AM November 1, 2007. The final song played under the old call letters at 5:58AM was [[Michelle Wright]]'s version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Andy Kim song)|Rock Me Gently]]\", ending an 84-year era (though the TV station would officially continue using CFQC, although its on-air branding by this time had become CTV Saskatoon). At 7:00AM, the station changed its call letters to CKBL and its branding to \"92.9 The Bull\". The first song played under the new callsign was [[Big & Rich]]'s \"[[Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy]]\". It also adopted a New Country format under the direction of program director and morning show co-host Steve \"Hurricane\" Huber.\n\nThe Bull's on-air lineup consists of \"Mornings with Pat Dubois\" ; \"Mid-days with Cristy Beggs\"; \"Afternoons with Kranky\" and \"Evenings with Trevor\". The station is also the broadcast home of the [[Saskatchewan Rush]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]].\n\nCKBL is the former [[call sign|call]] of two stations in Kelowna, British Columbia, the FM station now known as [[CHSU-FM|99.9 Sun FM]] and the current [[CKFR]]-AM.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.929thebullrocks.com/ 92.9 The Bull]\n* {{History of Canadian Broadcasting}}\n* {{RecnetCanada|CKBL-FM}}\n\n{{Saskatoon Radio}}\n\n{{coord|52|10|54|N|106|23|14|W|type:landmark_region:CA|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Saskatoon|KBL]]\n[[Category:Country radio stations in Canada|KBL]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1923]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in Saskatchewan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Radio station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n | name = CKBL-FM\n | image = CKBL-FM.png\n | image_size = 250px\n | city = [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n | branding = ''92.9 The Bull''\n | slogan = Your Country\n | airdate = 1923 (AM)<br />1995 (FM)\n | frequency = 92.9&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] ([[FM radio|FM]])\n | format = [[country music|Country]]\n | erp = 100,000&nbsp;[[watt]]s\n | haat = {{convert|195|meters}}\n | class = C1\n | callsign_meaning = '''C'''<br>'''K'''<br>'''B'''U'''L'''L\n | former_callsigns = CFQC\n | former_frequencies = 400 metres (1923-1925)<br>910 kHz (1925-1933)<br>840 kHz (1933-1941)<br>[[600 AM|600 kHz]] (1941-1995)\n | owner = [[Saskatoon Media Group]]\n | sister_stations = [[CJWW]], [[CJMK-FM]]\n | webcast = [http://www.929thebullrocks.com/mediaplayer_bull.html Listen Live]\n | website = [http://www.929thebullrocks.com/ 92.9 The Bull]\n | affiliations = \n}}\n'''CKBL-FM''', branded as '''92.9 The Bull''', is a [[country music|country]] [[radio station]] in downtown [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]].
