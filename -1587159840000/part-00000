The choice of black as the colour of the Abbasid Revolution was already motivated by the \"black standards out of Khorasan\" tradition associated with the [[Mahdi]]. The contrast of white vs. black as the Umayyad vs. Abbasid dynastic colour over time developed in white as the colour of Shia Islam and black as the colour of Sunni Islam: \"The proselytes of the \u02bfAbbasid revolution took full advantage of the eschatological expectations raised by black banners in their campaign to undermine the Umayyad dynasty from within. Even after the \u02bfAbbasids had triumphed over the Umayyads in 750, they continued to deploy black as their dynastic colour; not only the banners but the headdresses and garments of the \u02bfAbbasid caliphs were black [...] The ubiquitous black created a striking contrast with the banners and dynastic color of the Umayyads, which had been white [...] The Ismaili Shi\u02bfite counter-caliphate founded by the Fatimids took white as its dynastic color, creating a visual contrast to the \u02bfAbbasid enemy [...] white became the Shi\u02bfite color, in deliberate opposition to the black of the \u02bfAbbasid 'establishment'.\" Jane Hathaway, ''A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen'', 2012,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-lPC7DgepEC&pg=PA96 p. 97f.] After the revolution, Islamic apocalyptic circles admitted that the Abbasid banners would be black but asserted that the Mahdi's standard would be black and larger.

Although Abbasid leadership over the vast [[Islamic empire]] was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the Caliphate, the dynasty retained control over its [[Mesopotamian]] domain. The Abbasids' period of cultural fruition and its (reduced) territorial control ended in 1258 with the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulagu Khan]] and the execution of [[Al-Musta'sim]]. The Abbasid line of rulers, and Muslim culture in general, re-centred themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power (with the brief exception of Caliph [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in of Cairo]]), the dynasty continued to claim religious authority until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1517.{{sfn|Holt|1984}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Abbasid Revolution (750\u2013751)===\n{{main|Abbasid Revolution}}\nThe Abbasid caliphs were [[Arab people|Arab]]s descended from [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same [[Banu Hashim]] clan. The Abbasids claimed to be the true successors of Prophet Muhammad in replacing the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] descendants of [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams|Banu Umayya]] by virtue of their closer bloodline to Muhammad.\n\nThe Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], \"The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of [[Merv]] with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]\".{{sfn|Lapidus|2002|p=54}} The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire.

Abu al-'Abbas' successor [[Al-Mansur]] welcomed non-Arab Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian cultures, it alienated many of their Arab supporters, particularly the [[Khorasanian Arabs]] who had supported them in their battles against the Umayyads.\n\nThese fissures in their support led to immediate problems. The Umayyads, while out of power, were not destroyed. The only surviving member of the Umayyad royal family, which had been all but annihilated, ultimately made his way to Spain where he established himself as an independent [[Emir]] ([[Abd ar-Rahman I]], 756). In 929, [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] assumed the title of Caliph, establishing [[Al Andalus]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] as a rival to Baghdad as the legitimate capital of the Islamic Empire.\n\nIn 756, the Abbasid Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] sent over 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] in the [[An Shi Rebellion]] against [[An Lushan]]. The Abbasids or \"Black Flags,\" as they were commonly called, were known in Tang dynasty chronicles as the ''h\u0113iy\u012b D\u00e0sh\u00ed'', \"The Black-robed Tazi\", ({{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u8863\u5927\u98df}}) (\"Tazi\" being a borrowing from Persian ''[[wikt:\u062a\u0627\u0632\u06cc|T\u0101z\u012b]]'', the word for \"Arab\").{{refn|group=nb|Wade states \"Tazi in Persian sources referred to a people in that land, but was later extended to cover Arab lands. The Persian term was adopted by Tang China (D\u00e0sh\u00ed :\u5927\u98df) to refer to the Arabs until the 12th century.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|2012|p=138}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Marshall Broomhall writes, \"With the rise of the Abbasides we enter upon a somewhat different phase of Muslim history, and approach the period when an important body of Muslim troops entered and settled within the Chinese Empire. While the Abbasids inaugurated that era of literature and science associated with the Court at Bagdad, the hitherto predominant Arab element began to give way to the Turks, who soon became the bodyguard of the Caliphs, 'until in the end the Caliphs became the helpless tools of their rude protectors.'\n\nSeveral embassies from the Abbaside Caliphs to the Chinese Court are recorded in the T'ang Annals, the most important of these being those of (A-bo-lo-ba) Abul Abbas, the founder of the new dynasty, that of (A-p'u-cKa-fo) Abu Giafar, the builder of Bagdad and that of (A-lun) Harun al Raschid, best known, perhaps, in modern days through the popular work, Arabian Nights. The Abbasides or 'Black Flags,' as they were commonly called, are known in Chinese history as the Heh-i Ta-shih, 'The Black-robed Arabs.'\n\nFive years after the rise of the Abbasides, at a time when Abu Giafar, the second Caliph, was busy plotting the assassination of his great and able rival Abu Muslim, who is regarded as \"the leading figure of the age\" and the de facto founder of the house of Abbas so far as military prowess is concerned, a terrible rebellion broke out in China. This was in 755, and the leader was a Turk or Tartar named An Lu-shan. This man, who had gained great favour with the Emperor Hsuan Tsung, and had been placed at the head of a vast army operating against the Turks and Tartars on the north-west frontier, ended in proclaiming his independence and declaring war upon his now aged Imperial patron. The Emperor, driven from his capital, abdicated in favour of his son, Su Tsung (756\u2013763), who at once appealed to the Arabs for help.\n\nThe Caliph Abu Giafar, whose army, we are told by Sir William Muir, was fitted throughout with improved weapons and armour,' responded to this request, and sent a contingent of some 4000 men, who enabled the Emperor, in 757, to recover his two capitals, Sianfu and Honanfu. These Arab troops, who probably came from some garrison on the frontiers of Turkestan, never returned to their former camp, but remained in China, where they married Chinese wives, and thus became, according to common report, the real nucleus of the naturalised Chinese Mohammedans of to-day.\n\nWhile this story has the support of the official history of the T'ang dynasty, there is, unfortunately, no authorised statement as to how many troops the Caliph really sent. The statement, however, is also supported by the Chinese Mohammedan inscriptions and literature. Though the settlement of this large body of Arabs in China may be accepted as probably the largest and most definite event recorded concerning the advent of Islam, it is necessary at the same time not to overlook the facts already stated in the previous chapter, which prove that large numbers of foreigners had entered China prior to this date.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=25\u201326}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Frank Brinkley says, \"It would seem, however, that trade occupied the attention of the early Mohammedan settlers rather than religious propagandism; that while they observed the tenets and practised the rites of their faith in China, they did not undertake any strenuous campaign against either Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West by the oversea or the overland routes. According to Giles, the true stock of the present Chinese Mohammedans was a small army of four thousand Arabian soldiers, who, being sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion, were subsequently permitted to settle in China, where they married native wives.\n\nThe numbers of this colony received large accessions in the 12th and 13th centuries during the conquests of Genghis, and ultimately the Mohammedans formed an appreciable element of the population, having their own mosques and schools, and observing the rites of their religion, but winning few converts except among the aboriginal tribes, as the Lolos and the Mantsu. Their failure as propagandists is doubtless due to two causes, first, that, according to the inflexible rule of their creed, the Koran might not be translated into Chinese or any other foreign language; secondly and chiefly, that their denunciations of idolatry were as unpalatable to ancestor-worshipping Chinese as were their interdicts against pork and wine. They were never prevented, however, from practising their faith so long as they obeyed the laws of the land, and the numerous mosques that exist throughout China prove what a large measure of liberty these professors of a strange creed enjoyed. One feature of the mosques is noticeable, however: though distinguished by large arches and by Arabic inscriptions, they are generally constructed and arranged so as to bear some resemblance to Buddhist temples, and they have tablets carrying the customary ascription of reverence to the Emperor of China \u2013 facts suggesting that their builders were not entirely free from a sense of the inexpediency of differentiating the evidences of their religion too conspicuously from those of the popular creed. It has been calculated that in the regions north of the Yangtse the followers of Islam aggregate as many as ten millions, and that eighty thousand are to be found in one of the towns of Szchuan. On the other hand, just as it has been shown above that although the Central Government did not in any way interdict or obstruct the tradal operations of foreigners in early times, the local officials sometimes subjected them to extortion and maltreatment of a grievous and even unendurable nature, so it appears that while as a matter of State policy, full tolerance was extended to the Mohammedan creed, its disciples frequently found themselves the victims of such unjust discrimination at the hand of local officialdom that they were driven to seek redress in rebellion. That, however, did not occur until the 19th century. There is no evidence that, prior to the time of the Great Manchu Emperor Chienlung (1736\u20131796), Mohammedanism presented any deterrent aspect to the Chinese. That renowned ruler, whose conquests carried his banners to the Pamirs and the Himalayas, did indeed conceive a strong dread of the potentialities of Islamic fanaticism reinforced by disaffection on the part of the aboriginal tribes among whom the faith had many adherents. He is said to have entertained at one time the terrible project of eliminating this source of danger in Shensi and Kansuh by killing every Mussulman found there, but whether he really contemplated an act so foreign to the general character of his procedure is doubtful. The broad fact is that the Central Government of China has never persecuted Mohammedans or discriminated against them. They are allowed to present themselves at the examinations for civil or military appointments, and the successful candidates obtain office as readily as their Chinese competitors.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brinkley|1902|pp=149\u2013152}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|It states in Moule's book, \"though the actual date and circumstances of the introduction of Islam into China cannot be traced with certainty further back than the 13th century, yet the existence of settlements of foreign Moslems with their Mosques at Ganfu (Canton) during the T'ang dynasty (618\u2013907) is certain, and later they spread to Ch'uan-chou and to Kan-p'u, Hangchow, and perhaps to Ningpo and Shanghai. These were not preaching or proselytising inroads, but commercial enterprises, and in the latter half of the 8th century there were Moslem troops in Shensi, 3,000 men, under Abu Giafar, coming to support the dethroned Emperor in 756. In the 13th century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan in 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Moslem affairs in China.\n\nThe present Muslim element in China is most numerous in Yunnan and Kansu; and the most learned Muslims reside chiefly in Ssuch'uan, the majority of their books being printed in the capital city, Ch'eng-tu. Kansu is perhaps the most dominantly Mohammedan province in China, and here many different sects are found, and mosques with minarets used by the orthodox muezzin calling to prayer, and in one place veiled women are met with. These, however, are not Turks or Saracens, but for the most part pure Chinese. The total Moslem population is probably under 4,000,000, though other statistical estimates, always uncertain in China, vary from thirty to ten millions; but the figures given here are the most reliable at present obtainable, and when it is remembered that Islam in China has not been to any great extent a preaching or propagandist power by force or the sword, it is difficult to understand the survival and existence of such a large number as that, small, indeed, compared with former estimates, but surely a very large and vigorous element.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Moule|1914|p=317}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|In Giles' book, he writes \"Mahomedans: IEJ Iej.

They were not mentioned in the edict of 845, which proved such a blow to Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity perhaps because they were less obtrusive in the propagation of their religion, a policy aided by the absence of anything like a commercial spirit in religious matters.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Giles|1915|p=139}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, in the same book, \"The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it may still be seen.

There must at that time have been a considerable number of Mahometans in Canton, though not so many as might be supposed if reliance could be placed on the figures given in reference to a massacre which took place in 879. The fact is that most of these Mahometans went to China simply as traders; they did not intend to settle permanently in the country, and when business permitted, they returned to their old haunts. About two thousand Mussulman families are still to be found at Canton, and a similar number at Foochow; descendants, perhaps, of the old sea-borne contingents which began to arrive in the seventh and eighth centuries.

The trend of weakening of the central power and strengthening of the minor caliphates on the periphery continued.<ref name=mag />\n\nAn exception was the 10-year period of [[Al-Mu'tadid]]'s rule (892\u2013902). He brought parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khorasan back into Abbasid control. Especially after the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\" (861\u2013870), the Abbasid central government was weakened and centrifugal tendencies became more prominent in the Caliphate's provinces. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various [[amir]]s, and the caliph [[al-Radi]] was forced to acknowledge their power by creating the position of \"Prince of Princes\" (''[[amir al-umara]]'').<ref name=mag />\n\n[[Al-Mustakfi]] had a short reign from 944\u2013946, and it was during this period that the Persian faction known as the [[Buyids]] from [[Daylam]] swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy in Baghdad. According to the history of [[Miskawayh]], they began distributing [[iqta]]s ([[fief]]s in the form of tax farms) to their supporters. This period of localized secular control was to last nearly 100 years.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} The loss of Abbasid power to the Buyids would shift as the Seljuks would take over from the Persians.<ref name=mag />\n\nAt the end of the eighth century, the Abbasids found they could no longer keep together a huge polity, larger than that of Rome, from Baghdad. In 793 the [[Zaydi]]-Shia dynasty of [[Idrisids]] set up a state from Fez in Morocco, while a family of governors under the Abbasids became increasingly independent until they founded the Aghlabid Emirate from the 830s. Al-Mu'tasim started the downward slide by utilizing non-Muslim mercenaries in his personal army. Also during this period officers started assassinating superiors with whom they disagreed, in particular the caliphs.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}\n\nBy the 870s, Egypt became autonomous under [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]. In the East as well, governors decreased their ties to the center. The [[Saffarids]] of Herat and the [[Samanids]] of Bukhara had broken away from the 870s, cultivating a much more [[Persianate culture]] and statecraft. By this time only the central lands of Mesopotamia were under direct Abbasid control, with Palestine and the Hijaz often managed by the Tulunids. Byzantium, for its part, had begun to push Arab Muslims farther east in Anatolia.\n\nBy the 920s, the situation had changed further, as North Africa was lost to the Abbasids. A Shia sect only recognizing the first five Imams and tracing its roots to Muhammad's daughter Fatima took control of Idrisid and then Aghlabid domains.<ref name=mag /> Called the [[Fatimid dynasty]], they had advanced to Egypt in 969, establishing their capital near Fustat in Cairo, which they built as a bastion of Shia learning and politics. By 1000 they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam in the form of the Abbasids. By this time the latter state had fragmented into several governorships that, while recognizing caliphal authority from Baghdad, did mostly as they wanted, fighting with each other. The Caliph himself was under 'protection' of the Buyid Emirs who possessed all of Iraq and western Iran, and were quietly Shia in their sympathies.\n\nOutside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury, such as the [[Soomro]] [[Emir]]s that had gained control of [[Sindh]] and ruled the entire province from their capital of [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]].<ref name=\"Brauer\" /> [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] took the title of sultan, as opposed to the [[Emir|\"amir\"]] that had been in more common usage, signifying the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]]'s independence from caliphal authority, despite Mahmud's ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer mentioned the caliph's name in the Friday [[khutba]], or struck it off their coinage.<ref name=\"Brauer\" />\n\nThe [[Isma'ili]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo contested the Abbasids for even the titular authority of the Islamic [[ummah]]. They commanded some support in the Shia sections of Baghdad (such as [[Karkh]]), although Baghdad was the city most closely connected to the caliphate, even in the Buyid and Seljuq eras. The Fatimids' green banners contrasted with Abbasids' black, and the challenge of the Fatimids only ended with their downfall in the 12th century.\n\n===Buyid and Seljuq control (945\u20131118)===\nDespite the power of the [[Buyids|Buyid]] amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buyid bureaucrat [[Hilal al-Sabi']], and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. As Buyid power waned with the rule of [[Baha' al-Daula]], the caliphate was able to regain some measure of strength. The caliph [[al-Qadir]], for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the ''[[Baghdad Manifesto]]''. The caliphs kept order in Baghdad itself, attempting to prevent the outbreak of [[fitna (word)|fitnas]] in the capital, often contending with the ''[[ayyarun]]''.\n\nWith the Buyid dynasty on the wane, a vacuum was created that was eventually filled by the dynasty of [[Oghuz Turks]] known as the [[Seljuqs]]. By 1055, the Seljuqs had wrested control from the Buyids and Abbasids, and took any remaining temporal power.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} When the amir and former slave [[Basasiri]] took up the Shia [[Fatimid]] banner in Baghdad in 1056\u201357, the caliph [[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|al-Qa'im]] was unable to defeat him without outside help. [[Toghril Beg]], the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.\n\nOnce again, the Abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the Abbasid caliph remained the titular head of the Islamic community. The succeeding sultans [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malikshah]], as well as their vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]], took up residence in Persia, but held power over the Abbasids in Baghdad. When the dynasty began to weaken in the 12th century, the Abbasids gained greater independence once again.\n\n===Revival of military strength (1118\u20131258)===\n[[File:Abbasids Baghdad Iraq 1244.JPG|thumb|upright|Coin of the Abbasids, Baghdad, 1244]]\n\nWhile the Caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] was the first caliph to build an army capable of meeting a Seljuk army in battle, he was nonetheless defeated in 1135 and assassinated. The Caliph [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|al-Muqtafi]] was the first Abbasid Caliph to regain the full military independence of the Caliphate, with the help of his vizier [[Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra|Ibn Hubayra]]. After nearly 250 years of subjection to foreign dynasties, he successfully defended Baghdad against the Seljuqs in the [[siege of Baghdad (1157)]], thus securing Iraq for the Abbasids.

However, creation of this foreign army and al-Mu'tasim's transfer of the capital from Baghdad to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] created a division between the caliphate and the peoples they claimed to rule.

The style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, bearing not only similar styles, with harems, animals, and dancing people, all enclosed in scrollwork, but the garments are also Persian.<ref name=dim2>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969a|p=206}}</ref> [[Nishapur]] had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show both monochromatic and polychromatic artwork from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous piece of art consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies them as [[Tahirid]], which was, again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four-foot high dedo.<ref name=dim2/>\n\n===Pottery===\n[[File:Bowl with Kufic Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bowl with [[Kufic]] Inscription, 9th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWhereas painting and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery was a different story. Islamic culture as a whole, and the Abbasids in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=211}}</ref> Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries has been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, and humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from [[Samarra]] exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These predominantly being made for the Caliphs use. Tiles were also made using this same technique to create both monochromatic and polychromatic luster tiles.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\nEgypt being a center of the textile industry was part of Abbasid cultural advancement. [[Copt]]s were employed in the textile industry and produced linens and silks. [[Tinnis]] was famous for its factories and had over 5,000 looms. Examples of textiles were ''kasab'', a fine linen for turbans, and ''badana'' for upper-class garments.  The [[kiswah]] for the [[kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] was made in a town named [[Tuna (Egypt)|Tuna]] near Tinnis. Fine silk was also made in [[Dabik]] and [[Damietta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|p=216}}</ref> Of particular interest are stamped and inscribed fabrics, which used not only inks but also liquid gold. Some of the finer pieces were colored in such a manner as to require six separate stamps to achieve the proper design and color. This technology spread to Europe eventually.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|pp=216\u2013217}}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\n{{Main |Inventions in medieval Islam|Arab Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of Islamic science and technology}}\n[[File:Wasseruhr Harun al Raschid.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing a [[water clock]] given to [[Charlemagne]] by [[Harun al-Rashid]]]]\nIn technology, the Abbasids adopted [[papermaking]] from China.<ref name= Lucas/> The use of paper spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in [[al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) and then the rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than [[parchment]], less likely to crack than [[papyrus]], and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and copies of the Qur'an. \"Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cotter|2001}}</ref> It was from the Abbasids that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2003|p=166}}</ref> The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure [[potassium nitrate]] and an [[explosive]] gunpowder effect were first developed.<ref>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002}}</ref>\n\nAdvances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary [[sextant]] (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Abbasid sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large three masted merchant vessels to the [[Mediterranean]]. The name [[caravel]] may derive from an earlier Arab ship known as the ''q\u0101rib''.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwarz|2013}}</ref> Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the [[Mediterranean]], along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]] or [[Genoa]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through the Abbasid caliphate between China and Europe.\n\n[[File:Bruges Belgium Windmill-Bonne-Chiere-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Windmills]] were among Abbasid inventions in technology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UFhGW3MxgPMC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=abbasid+windmill#v=onepage&q=abbasid%20windmill&f=false|title=Syria|last=Phillips|first=Douglas A.|last2=Gritzner|first2=Charles F.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438132389|language=en}}</ref>|left]]\n\nEngineers in the Abbasid caliphate made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]], [[wind power]], and petroleum (notably by distillation into [[kerosene]]). The industrial uses of [[watermill]]s in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-[[Water wheel|wheeled]] and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from [[al-Andalus]] and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks.<ref name=Lucas>{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=10}}</ref> Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating [[crankshaft]]s, employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.<ref name=Hassan>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002a}}</ref> Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by [[manual labour]] in [[ancient times]] to be [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of waterpower had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded for the first time in [[Catalonia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lucas|2005}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nA number of industries were generated during the [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]], including early industries for textiles, sugar, rope-making, matting, silk, and paper. [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] passed on knowledge of chemistry and instrument making in particular.<ref>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002b}}</ref> The agricultural and [[handicraft]] industries also experienced high levels of growth during this period.<ref name = Labib>{{harvnb|Labib|1969}}</ref>\n\n===Status of women===\nIn contrast to the earlier era, women in Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community's central affairs.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=112\u201315}} While their Muslim forbears led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the [[Hadith]] literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim conquest. Gorgias Press LLC, 2005</ref> many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\">Abbott, Nabia. Two queens of Baghdad: mother and wife of H\u0101r\u016bn al Rash\u012bd. University of Chicago Press, 1946.</ref> In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Nabia Abbott]], preeminent historian of elite women of the Abbasid Caliphate, describes the lives of harem women as follows.\n<blockquote>The choicest women were imprisoned behind heavy curtains and locked doors, the strings and keys of which were entrusted into the hands of that pitiable creature \u2013 the [[eunuch]]. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.\n\nElite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:\n:: To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.\n:: At times of disaster and catastrophe\n:: God multiplies rewards for the patient.\n:: To be patient in misery\n:: Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.\n:: Among the blessings of God undoubtedly\n:: Is the preservation of sons\n:: And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}\n\nEven so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic [[Rabia Basri|Raabi'a al-Adwiyya]] (714\u2013801 CE), the princess and poet [['Ulayya bint al-Mahdi]] (777\u2013825 CE), and the singing-girls [[Sh\u0101riyah]] ({{circa|815}}\u201370 CE), [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871 CE) and [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (797\u2013890 CE).<ref>{{cite book|last=Qutbuddin |first=Tahera |editor=Josef W.

Non-Muslims were called [[dhimmi]]<nowiki/>s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=27\u201330}}</ref> Dhimmis did not have all of the privileges that Muslims had and commonly had to pay [[jizya]], a tax for not being a Muslim. One of the common aspects of the treatment of the dhimmis is that their treatment depended on who the Caliph was at the time. Some Abbasid rulers, like [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (822 \u2013 861 CE) imposed strict restrictions on what dhimmis could wear in public, often yellow garments that distinguished them from Muslims.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=102\u2013103|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}</ref> Other restrictions al-Mutawakkil imposed included limiting the role of the dhimmis in government, seizing dhimmi housing and making it harder for dhimmis to become educated.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most other Abbasid caliphs were not as strict as al-Mutawakkil, though. During the reign of [[Al-Mansur]] (714 \u2013 775 CE), it was common for Jews and Christians to influence the overall culture in the [[Caliphate]], specifically in [[Baghdad]]. Jews and Christians did this by participating in scholarly work and Christians even influenced Islamic funeral service traditions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was common that laws that were imposed against dhimmis during one caliph's rule were either discarded or not practiced during future caliphs' reigns. Al-Mansur and al-Mutawakkil both instituted laws that forbade non-Muslims from participating in public office.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=108\u2013110|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}</ref> Al-Mansur did not follow his own law very closely, bringing dhimmis back to the Caliphate's treasury due to the needed expertise of dhimmis in the area of finance.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Sirry|first=Mun'im|date=2011|title=The public role of Dhimm\u012bs during \u02bfAbb\u0101sid times|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=74|issue=2|pages=187\u2013204|jstor=41287947|doi=10.1017/S0041977X11000024|doi-access=free}}</ref> Al-Mutawakkil followed the law banning dhimmis from public office more seriously, although, soon after his reign, many of the laws concerning dhimmis participating in government were completely unobserved or at least less strictly observed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Even [[Al-Muqtadir]] ({{r.|908|932 CE}}), who held a similar stance as al-Mutawakkil on barring non-Muslims from public office, himself had multiple Christian secretaries, indicating that non-Muslims still had access to many of the most important figures within the Caliphate.<ref name=\":2\" /> Past having a casual association or just being a secretary to high-ranking Islamic officials, many Caliphs like Al-Mansur would personally appoint dhimmis to important positions of power, like collector of revenue.\n\nJews and Christians may have had a lower overall status compared to Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate, but dhimmis were often allowed to hold respectable and even prestigious occupations in some cases, such as doctors and public officeholders. Jews and Christians were also allowed to be rich even if they were taxed for being a dhimmi.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dhimmis were capable of moving up and down the social ladder, though this largely depended on the particular caliph. An indication as to the social standing of Jews and Christians at the time was their ability to live next to Muslim people. While al-Mansur was ruling the Caliphate, for instance, it was not uncommon for dhimmis to live in the same neighborhoods as Muslims.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of the biggest reasons why dhimmis were allowed to hold prestigious jobs and positions in government is that they were generally important to the well-being of the state and were proficient to excellent with the work at hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> Some Muslims in the Caliphate took offense to the idea that there were dhimmis in public offices who were in a way ruling over them although it was an Islamic state, while other Muslims were at time jealous of some dhimmis for having a level of wealth or prestige greater than other Muslims, even if Muslims were still the majority of the ruling class.<ref name=\":2\" /> In general, Muslims, Jews, and Christians had close relations that could be considered positive at times, especially for Jews, in contrast to how Jews were being treated in Europe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of the laws and restrictions that were imposed on dhimmis oftentimes resembled other laws that previous states had used to discriminate against a minority religion, specifically Jewish people. Romans in the fourth century banned Jewish people from holding public offices, banned Roman citizens from converting to Judaism, and often demoted Jews who were serving in the Roman military.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate|last=Nicholls|first=William|publisher=Haddon Craftsmen|year=1993|isbn=9780876683989|location=Scranton|pages=196\u2013197}}</ref> In direct contrast, there was an event in which two [[vizier]]s, Ibn al-Furat and [[Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah]], argued about Ibn al-Furat's decision to make a Christian the head of the military.  A previous vizier, Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Bazuri, had previously done so. These laws predated al-Mansur's laws against dhimmis and often had similar restrictions, although Roman emperors were often much more strict on enforcing these laws than many Abbasid caliphs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism Before the Holocaust|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Pearson Educated Limited|year=2000|isbn=9780582369641|location=Harlow|pages=38}}</ref>\n\n===Arabization===\nWhile the Abbasids originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized, particularly in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region (namely [[Mesopotamia]] and [[the Levant]]) as had begun under Umayyad rule. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, many people from different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Ochsenwald|Fisher|2004|p=69}}</ref>\n\n==Military==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}\nIn Baghdad there were many Abbasid military leaders who were or said they were of [[Arabs|Arab]] descent.

The Abbasid authority began to deteriorate during the reign of [[al-Radi]] when their Turkic Army generals, who already had de facto independence, stopped paying the Caliphate. Even provinces close to Baghdad began to seek local dynastic rule. Also, the Abbasids found themselves to often be at conflict with the Umayyads in Spain.

Except for the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in Egypt, recognizing a Shia succession through [[Ali]], and the Andalusian Caliphates of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Umayyads]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], every Muslim dynasty at least acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of the Abbasids as Caliph and Commander of the Faithful.\n\n* Morocco: [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]] (788\u2013974) \u2192 [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] (1040\u20131147) \u2192 [[Almohad]]s (1120\u20131269) \u2192 [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] (1472\u20131554) \u2192 [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasids]] (1472\u20131554)\n* [[Ifriqiya]] (modern Tunisia, eastern Algeria and western Libya): [[Aghlabids]] (800\u2013909 CE) \u2192 [[Fatimid]]s of Egypt (909\u2013973 CE) \u2192 [[Zirids]] (973\u20131148) \u2192 [[Almohads]] (1148\u20131229) \u2192 [[Hafsids]] (1229\u20131574)\n* Egypt and Palestine: [[Tulunids]] (868\u2013905 CE) \u2192 [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] (935\u2013969) \u2192 [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909\u20131171) \u2192 [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1171\u20131250) \u2192 [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] (1250\u20131517)\n* [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Al-Jazira]] (modern Syria and northern Iraq): [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]] (890\u20131004 CE) \u2192 [[Marwanids]] (990\u20131085) and [[Uqaylids]] (990\u20131096) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1034\u20131194) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Ilkhanate]] (1231\u20131335)\n* Southwest Iran: [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]] (934\u20131055) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1034\u20131194) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] \u2192 [[Injuids]] (1335\u20131357) \u2192 [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]] (1314\u20131393)\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (modern Iran, Afghanistan and [[Turkmenistan]]): [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] (821 -873) \u2192 [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] (873\u2013903) \u2192 [[Samanids]] (903\u2013995) \u2192 [[Ghaznavids]] (995\u20131038) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1038\u20131194) \u2192 [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] (1011\u20131215) \u2192 [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmians]] (1077\u20131231) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Ilkhanate]] (1231\u20131335)\n* [[Transoxiana]] (modern [[Central Asia]]): [[Samanids]] (819\u2013999) \u2192 [[Karakhanids]] (840\u20131212) \u2192 [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmians]] (1077\u20131231) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (1225\u20131687)\n\n==Dynasties claiming Abbasid descent==\nCenturies after the Abbasids' fall, several dynasties have claimed descent from them, as \"claiming kinship relation with the Prophet Muhammad, that is, claiming an affiliation to the 'People of the House' or the status of a  sayyid or sharif, has arguably been the most widespread way in Muslim societies of supporting one's moral or material objectives with genealogical credentials.\"<ref name=\"ecommons.aku.edu\">https://ecommons.aku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=uk_ismc_series_emc</ref> Such claims of continuity with Muhammad or his Hashemite kin such as the Abbasids foster a sense of \"political viability\" for a candidate dynasty, with the intention of \"serving an internal audience\" (or in other words, gaining legitimacy in the view of the masses).<ref name=\"ecommons.aku.edu\"/> The final ruler of the [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] Indian princely state was particularly so.

Even after the \u02bfAbbasids had triumphed over the Umayyads in 750, they continued to deploy black as their dynastic colour; not only the banners but the headdresses and garments of the \u02bfAbbasid caliphs were black [...] The ubiquitous black created a striking contrast with the banners and dynastic color of the Umayyads, which had been white [...] The Ismaili Shi\u02bfite counter-caliphate founded by the Fatimids took white as its dynastic color, creating a visual contrast to the \u02bfAbbasid enemy [...] white became the Shi\u02bfite color, in deliberate opposition to the black of the \u02bfAbbasid 'establishment'.\" Jane Hathaway, ''A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen'', 2012,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-lPC7DgepEC&pg=PA96 p. 97f.] After the revolution, Islamic apocalyptic circles admitted that the Abbasid banners would be black but asserted that the Mahdi's standard would be black and larger.

Although Abbasid leadership over the vast [[Islamic empire]] was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the Caliphate, the dynasty retained control over its [[Mesopotamian]] domain. The Abbasids' period of cultural fruition and its (reduced) territorial control ended in 1258 with the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulagu Khan]] and the execution of [[Al-Musta'sim]]. The Abbasid line of rulers, and Muslim culture in general, re-centred themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power (with the brief exception of Caliph [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in of Cairo]]), the dynasty continued to claim religious authority until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1517.{{sfn|Holt|1984}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Abbasid Revolution (750\u2013751)===\n{{main|Abbasid Revolution}}\nThe Abbasid caliphs were [[Arab people|Arab]]s descended from [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same [[Banu Hashim]] clan. The Abbasids claimed to be the true successors of Prophet Muhammad in replacing the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] descendants of [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams|Banu Umayya]] by virtue of their closer bloodline to Muhammad.\n\nThe Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], \"The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of [[Merv]] with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]\".{{sfn|Lapidus|2002|p=54}} The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. [[Mohammad ibn Ali Abbasi|Muhammad ibn 'Ali]], a great-grandson of Abbas, began to campaign in [[Greater Persia|Persia]] for the return of power to the family of Prophet Muhammad, the [[Hashimites]], during the reign of [[Umar II]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Marwan II]], this opposition culminated in the rebellion of {{ill|Ibrahim al-Imam|ca}}, the fourth in descent from Abbas.

Abu al-'Abbas' successor [[Al-Mansur]] welcomed non-Arab Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian cultures, it alienated many of their Arab supporters, particularly the [[Khorasanian Arabs]] who had supported them in their battles against the Umayyads.\n\nThese fissures in their support led to immediate problems. The Umayyads, while out of power, were not destroyed. The only surviving member of the Umayyad royal family, which had been all but annihilated, ultimately made his way to Spain where he established himself as an independent [[Emir]] ([[Abd ar-Rahman I]], 756). In 929, [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] assumed the title of Caliph, establishing [[Al Andalus]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] as a rival to Baghdad as the legitimate capital of the Islamic Empire.\n\nIn 756, the Abbasid Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] sent over 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] in the [[An Shi Rebellion]] against [[An Lushan]]. The Abbasids or \"Black Flags,\" as they were commonly called, were known in Tang dynasty chronicles as the ''h\u0113iy\u012b D\u00e0sh\u00ed'', \"The Black-robed Tazi\", ({{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u8863\u5927\u98df}}) (\"Tazi\" being a borrowing from Persian ''[[wikt:\u062a\u0627\u0632\u06cc|T\u0101z\u012b]]'', the word for \"Arab\").{{refn|group=nb|Wade states \"Tazi in Persian sources referred to a people in that land, but was later extended to cover Arab lands. The Persian term was adopted by Tang China (D\u00e0sh\u00ed :\u5927\u98df) to refer to the Arabs until the 12th century.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|2012|p=138}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Marshall Broomhall writes, \"With the rise of the Abbasides we enter upon a somewhat different phase of Muslim history, and approach the period when an important body of Muslim troops entered and settled within the Chinese Empire. While the Abbasids inaugurated that era of literature and science associated with the Court at Bagdad, the hitherto predominant Arab element began to give way to the Turks, who soon became the bodyguard of the Caliphs, 'until in the end the Caliphs became the helpless tools of their rude protectors.'\n\nSeveral embassies from the Abbaside Caliphs to the Chinese Court are recorded in the T'ang Annals, the most important of these being those of (A-bo-lo-ba) Abul Abbas, the founder of the new dynasty, that of (A-p'u-cKa-fo) Abu Giafar, the builder of Bagdad and that of (A-lun) Harun al Raschid, best known, perhaps, in modern days through the popular work, Arabian Nights. The Abbasides or 'Black Flags,' as they were commonly called, are known in Chinese history as the Heh-i Ta-shih, 'The Black-robed Arabs.'\n\nFive years after the rise of the Abbasides, at a time when Abu Giafar, the second Caliph, was busy plotting the assassination of his great and able rival Abu Muslim, who is regarded as \"the leading figure of the age\" and the de facto founder of the house of Abbas so far as military prowess is concerned, a terrible rebellion broke out in China. This was in 755, and the leader was a Turk or Tartar named An Lu-shan. This man, who had gained great favour with the Emperor Hsuan Tsung, and had been placed at the head of a vast army operating against the Turks and Tartars on the north-west frontier, ended in proclaiming his independence and declaring war upon his now aged Imperial patron. The Emperor, driven from his capital, abdicated in favour of his son, Su Tsung (756\u2013763), who at once appealed to the Arabs for help.\n\nThe Caliph Abu Giafar, whose army, we are told by Sir William Muir, was fitted throughout with improved weapons and armour,' responded to this request, and sent a contingent of some 4000 men, who enabled the Emperor, in 757, to recover his two capitals, Sianfu and Honanfu. These Arab troops, who probably came from some garrison on the frontiers of Turkestan, never returned to their former camp, but remained in China, where they married Chinese wives, and thus became, according to common report, the real nucleus of the naturalised Chinese Mohammedans of to-day.\n\nWhile this story has the support of the official history of the T'ang dynasty, there is, unfortunately, no authorised statement as to how many troops the Caliph really sent. The statement, however, is also supported by the Chinese Mohammedan inscriptions and literature. Though the settlement of this large body of Arabs in China may be accepted as probably the largest and most definite event recorded concerning the advent of Islam, it is necessary at the same time not to overlook the facts already stated in the previous chapter, which prove that large numbers of foreigners had entered China prior to this date.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=25\u201326}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Frank Brinkley says, \"It would seem, however, that trade occupied the attention of the early Mohammedan settlers rather than religious propagandism; that while they observed the tenets and practised the rites of their faith in China, they did not undertake any strenuous campaign against either Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West by the oversea or the overland routes. According to Giles, the true stock of the present Chinese Mohammedans was a small army of four thousand Arabian soldiers, who, being sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion, were subsequently permitted to settle in China, where they married native wives.\n\nThe numbers of this colony received large accessions in the 12th and 13th centuries during the conquests of Genghis, and ultimately the Mohammedans formed an appreciable element of the population, having their own mosques and schools, and observing the rites of their religion, but winning few converts except among the aboriginal tribes, as the Lolos and the Mantsu. Their failure as propagandists is doubtless due to two causes, first, that, according to the inflexible rule of their creed, the Koran might not be translated into Chinese or any other foreign language; secondly and chiefly, that their denunciations of idolatry were as unpalatable to ancestor-worshipping Chinese as were their interdicts against pork and wine. They were never prevented, however, from practising their faith so long as they obeyed the laws of the land, and the numerous mosques that exist throughout China prove what a large measure of liberty these professors of a strange creed enjoyed. One feature of the mosques is noticeable, however: though distinguished by large arches and by Arabic inscriptions, they are generally constructed and arranged so as to bear some resemblance to Buddhist temples, and they have tablets carrying the customary ascription of reverence to the Emperor of China \u2013 facts suggesting that their builders were not entirely free from a sense of the inexpediency of differentiating the evidences of their religion too conspicuously from those of the popular creed. It has been calculated that in the regions north of the Yangtse the followers of Islam aggregate as many as ten millions, and that eighty thousand are to be found in one of the towns of Szchuan. On the other hand, just as it has been shown above that although the Central Government did not in any way interdict or obstruct the tradal operations of foreigners in early times, the local officials sometimes subjected them to extortion and maltreatment of a grievous and even unendurable nature, so it appears that while as a matter of State policy, full tolerance was extended to the Mohammedan creed, its disciples frequently found themselves the victims of such unjust discrimination at the hand of local officialdom that they were driven to seek redress in rebellion. That, however, did not occur until the 19th century. There is no evidence that, prior to the time of the Great Manchu Emperor Chienlung (1736\u20131796), Mohammedanism presented any deterrent aspect to the Chinese. That renowned ruler, whose conquests carried his banners to the Pamirs and the Himalayas, did indeed conceive a strong dread of the potentialities of Islamic fanaticism reinforced by disaffection on the part of the aboriginal tribes among whom the faith had many adherents. He is said to have entertained at one time the terrible project of eliminating this source of danger in Shensi and Kansuh by killing every Mussulman found there, but whether he really contemplated an act so foreign to the general character of his procedure is doubtful. The broad fact is that the Central Government of China has never persecuted Mohammedans or discriminated against them. They are allowed to present themselves at the examinations for civil or military appointments, and the successful candidates obtain office as readily as their Chinese competitors.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brinkley|1902|pp=149\u2013152}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|It states in Moule's book, \"though the actual date and circumstances of the introduction of Islam into China cannot be traced with certainty further back than the 13th century, yet the existence of settlements of foreign Moslems with their Mosques at Ganfu (Canton) during the T'ang dynasty (618\u2013907) is certain, and later they spread to Ch'uan-chou and to Kan-p'u, Hangchow, and perhaps to Ningpo and Shanghai. These were not preaching or proselytising inroads, but commercial enterprises, and in the latter half of the 8th century there were Moslem troops in Shensi, 3,000 men, under Abu Giafar, coming to support the dethroned Emperor in 756. In the 13th century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan in 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Moslem affairs in China.\n\nThe present Muslim element in China is most numerous in Yunnan and Kansu; and the most learned Muslims reside chiefly in Ssuch'uan, the majority of their books being printed in the capital city, Ch'eng-tu. Kansu is perhaps the most dominantly Mohammedan province in China, and here many different sects are found, and mosques with minarets used by the orthodox muezzin calling to prayer, and in one place veiled women are met with. These, however, are not Turks or Saracens, but for the most part pure Chinese. The total Moslem population is probably under 4,000,000, though other statistical estimates, always uncertain in China, vary from thirty to ten millions; but the figures given here are the most reliable at present obtainable, and when it is remembered that Islam in China has not been to any great extent a preaching or propagandist power by force or the sword, it is difficult to understand the survival and existence of such a large number as that, small, indeed, compared with former estimates, but surely a very large and vigorous element.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Moule|1914|p=317}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|In Giles' book, he writes \"Mahomedans: IEJ Iej.

Wahb-Abi-Kabcha travelled by sea to Canton, and thence overland to Si-ngan Fu, the capital, where he was well received. The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it still exists. Another mosque was erected in 742, but many of these M. came to China simply as traders, and by and by went back to their own country.

They were not mentioned in the edict of 845, which proved such a blow to Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity perhaps because they were less obtrusive in the propagation of their religion, a policy aided by the absence of anything like a commercial spirit in religious matters.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Giles|1915|p=139}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, in the same book, \"The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it may still be seen. The minaret, known as the Bare Pagoda, to distinguish it from a much more ornamental Buddhist pagoda near by, dates back to 850. There must at that time have been a considerable number of Mahometans in Canton, though not so many as might be supposed if reliance could be placed on the figures given in reference to a massacre which took place in 879. The fact is that most of these Mahometans went to China simply as traders; they did not intend to settle permanently in the country, and when business permitted, they returned to their old haunts. About two thousand Mussulman families are still to be found at Canton, and a similar number at Foochow; descendants, perhaps, of the old sea-borne contingents which began to arrive in the seventh and eighth centuries.

The Saffarids, from Khorasan, nearly seized Baghdad in 876, and the [[Tulunid]]s took control of most of Syria. The trend of weakening of the central power and strengthening of the minor caliphates on the periphery continued.<ref name=mag />\n\nAn exception was the 10-year period of [[Al-Mu'tadid]]'s rule (892\u2013902). He brought parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khorasan back into Abbasid control. Especially after the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\" (861\u2013870), the Abbasid central government was weakened and centrifugal tendencies became more prominent in the Caliphate's provinces. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various [[amir]]s, and the caliph [[al-Radi]] was forced to acknowledge their power by creating the position of \"Prince of Princes\" (''[[amir al-umara]]'').<ref name=mag />\n\n[[Al-Mustakfi]] had a short reign from 944\u2013946, and it was during this period that the Persian faction known as the [[Buyids]] from [[Daylam]] swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy in Baghdad. According to the history of [[Miskawayh]], they began distributing [[iqta]]s ([[fief]]s in the form of tax farms) to their supporters. This period of localized secular control was to last nearly 100 years.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} The loss of Abbasid power to the Buyids would shift as the Seljuks would take over from the Persians.<ref name=mag />\n\nAt the end of the eighth century, the Abbasids found they could no longer keep together a huge polity, larger than that of Rome, from Baghdad. In 793 the [[Zaydi]]-Shia dynasty of [[Idrisids]] set up a state from Fez in Morocco, while a family of governors under the Abbasids became increasingly independent until they founded the Aghlabid Emirate from the 830s. Al-Mu'tasim started the downward slide by utilizing non-Muslim mercenaries in his personal army. Also during this period officers started assassinating superiors with whom they disagreed, in particular the caliphs.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}\n\nBy the 870s, Egypt became autonomous under [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]. In the East as well, governors decreased their ties to the center. The [[Saffarids]] of Herat and the [[Samanids]] of Bukhara had broken away from the 870s, cultivating a much more [[Persianate culture]] and statecraft. By this time only the central lands of Mesopotamia were under direct Abbasid control, with Palestine and the Hijaz often managed by the Tulunids. Byzantium, for its part, had begun to push Arab Muslims farther east in Anatolia.\n\nBy the 920s, the situation had changed further, as North Africa was lost to the Abbasids. A Shia sect only recognizing the first five Imams and tracing its roots to Muhammad's daughter Fatima took control of Idrisid and then Aghlabid domains.<ref name=mag /> Called the [[Fatimid dynasty]], they had advanced to Egypt in 969, establishing their capital near Fustat in Cairo, which they built as a bastion of Shia learning and politics. By 1000 they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam in the form of the Abbasids. By this time the latter state had fragmented into several governorships that, while recognizing caliphal authority from Baghdad, did mostly as they wanted, fighting with each other. The Caliph himself was under 'protection' of the Buyid Emirs who possessed all of Iraq and western Iran, and were quietly Shia in their sympathies.\n\nOutside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury, such as the [[Soomro]] [[Emir]]s that had gained control of [[Sindh]] and ruled the entire province from their capital of [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]].<ref name=\"Brauer\" /> [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] took the title of sultan, as opposed to the [[Emir|\"amir\"]] that had been in more common usage, signifying the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]]'s independence from caliphal authority, despite Mahmud's ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer mentioned the caliph's name in the Friday [[khutba]], or struck it off their coinage.<ref name=\"Brauer\" />\n\nThe [[Isma'ili]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo contested the Abbasids for even the titular authority of the Islamic [[ummah]]. They commanded some support in the Shia sections of Baghdad (such as [[Karkh]]), although Baghdad was the city most closely connected to the caliphate, even in the Buyid and Seljuq eras. The Fatimids' green banners contrasted with Abbasids' black, and the challenge of the Fatimids only ended with their downfall in the 12th century.\n\n===Buyid and Seljuq control (945\u20131118)===\nDespite the power of the [[Buyids|Buyid]] amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buyid bureaucrat [[Hilal al-Sabi']], and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. As Buyid power waned with the rule of [[Baha' al-Daula]], the caliphate was able to regain some measure of strength. The caliph [[al-Qadir]], for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the ''[[Baghdad Manifesto]]''. The caliphs kept order in Baghdad itself, attempting to prevent the outbreak of [[fitna (word)|fitnas]] in the capital, often contending with the ''[[ayyarun]]''.\n\nWith the Buyid dynasty on the wane, a vacuum was created that was eventually filled by the dynasty of [[Oghuz Turks]] known as the [[Seljuqs]]. By 1055, the Seljuqs had wrested control from the Buyids and Abbasids, and took any remaining temporal power.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} When the amir and former slave [[Basasiri]] took up the Shia [[Fatimid]] banner in Baghdad in 1056\u201357, the caliph [[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|al-Qa'im]] was unable to defeat him without outside help. [[Toghril Beg]], the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.\n\nOnce again, the Abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the Abbasid caliph remained the titular head of the Islamic community. The succeeding sultans [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malikshah]], as well as their vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]], took up residence in Persia, but held power over the Abbasids in Baghdad. When the dynasty began to weaken in the 12th century, the Abbasids gained greater independence once again.\n\n===Revival of military strength (1118\u20131258)===\n[[File:Abbasids Baghdad Iraq 1244.JPG|thumb|upright|Coin of the Abbasids, Baghdad, 1244]]\n\nWhile the Caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] was the first caliph to build an army capable of meeting a Seljuk army in battle, he was nonetheless defeated in 1135 and assassinated. The Caliph [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|al-Muqtafi]] was the first Abbasid Caliph to regain the full military independence of the Caliphate, with the help of his vizier [[Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra|Ibn Hubayra]]. After nearly 250 years of subjection to foreign dynasties, he successfully defended Baghdad against the Seljuqs in the [[siege of Baghdad (1157)]], thus securing Iraq for the Abbasids.

They also wrote influential original philosophical works, and their thinking was incorporated into [[Christian philosophy]] during the Middle Ages, notably by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-islamic-scholar-who-gave-us-modern-philosophy|title=The Islamic Scholar Who Gave Us Modern Philosophy|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nThree speculative thinkers, [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]], and [[Avicenna]], combined [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through Islam, and [[Avicennism]] was later established as a result. Other influential Abbasid philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], and [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen).\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|[[Zumurrud Khatun Mosque|Zumurrud Khatun Tomb]] (1200 CE), in cemetery at [[Baghdad]]]]\nAs power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids, the architectural styles changed also. The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the [[Sasanian Empire]], utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco.<ref name=wil>{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=5}}</ref> Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire, beginning with the creation of Baghdad in 762, which was planned as a walled city with four gates, and a mosque and palace in the center. Al-Mansur, who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad, also planned the city of [[Raqqa]], along the [[Euphrates]]. Finally, in 836, al-Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the [[Tigris]], called [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This city saw 60 years of work, with race-courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere.<ref name=wil/> Due to the dry remote nature of the environment, some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens. [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] is a fine example of this type of building, which has stables, living quarters, and a mosque, all surrounding inner courtyards.<ref name=wil/> Other mosques of this era, such as the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], in [[Cairo]], and the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]], while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty, were substantially renovated in the 9th century. These renovations, so extensive as to ostensibly be rebuilds, were in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world, in an area that the [[Aghlabids]] controlled; however, the styles utilized were mainly Abbasid.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilmer|1969|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> Mesopotamia only has one surviving [[mausoleum]] from this era, in Samarra. This octagonal dome is the final resting place of [[al-Muntasir]].<ref name=wil2>{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=6}}</ref> Other architectural innovations and styles were few, such as the [[four-centred arch|four-centered arch]], and a dome erected on [[squinch]]es. Unfortunately, much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles.<ref name=wil2/>\n\n==== Foundation of Baghdad ====\nThe Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the epicenter of the empire, [[Baghdad]], in 762 CE, as a means of disassociating his dynasty from that of the preceding [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] (centered at Damascus) and the rebellious cities of Kufa and Basrah. Mesopotamia was an ideal locale for a capital city due to its high agricultural output, access to the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers (allowing for trade and communication across the region), central locale between the corners of the vast empire (stretching from Egypt to [[Afghanistan]]) and access to the Silk Road and Indian Ocean trade routes, all key reasons as to why the region has hosted important capital cities such as [[Ur]], [[Babylon]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Ctesiphon]] and was later desired by the British Empire as an outpost by which to maintain access to [[India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/iraq.htm|title=Iraq Mandate|website=www.britishempire.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The city was organized in a circular fashion next to the Tigris River, with massive brick walls being constructed in successive rings around the core by a workforce of 100,000 with four huge gates (named Kufa, Basrah, Khorasan and Syria). The central enclosure of the city contained Mansur's palace of 360,000 sqare feet in area and the great mosque of Baghdad, encompassing 90,000 sq feet. Travel across the Tigris and the network of waterways allowing the drainage of the Euphrates into the Tigris was facilitated by bridges and canals servicing the population.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Marozzi|first=Justin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/16/story-cities-day-3-baghdad-iraq-world-civilisation|title=Story of cities #3: the birth of Baghdad was a landmark for world civilisation|date=2016-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===Glass and crystal===\nThe Near East has, since Roman times, been recognized as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th-century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups intended for domestic use, with decorations including molded flutes, honeycomb patterns, and inscriptions.<ref name=dim>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|p=199}}</ref> Other styles seen that may not have come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or [[Kufic]] inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, has been found in [[Nishapur]], along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:British Museum Harem wall painting fragments 2.jpg|thumb|9th-century [[harem]] wall painting fragments found in [[Samarra]]]]\nEarly Abbasid painting has not survived in great quantities, and is sometimes harder to differentiate; however, Samarra provides good examples, as it was built by the Abbasids and abandoned 56 years later. The walls of the principal rooms of the palace that have been excavated show wall paintings and lively carved stucco [[Dado (architecture)|dadoes]]. The style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, bearing not only similar styles, with harems, animals, and dancing people, all enclosed in scrollwork, but the garments are also Persian.<ref name=dim2>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969a|p=206}}</ref> [[Nishapur]] had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show both monochromatic and polychromatic artwork from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous piece of art consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies them as [[Tahirid]], which was, again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four-foot high dedo.<ref name=dim2/>\n\n===Pottery===\n[[File:Bowl with Kufic Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bowl with [[Kufic]] Inscription, 9th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWhereas painting and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery was a different story. Islamic culture as a whole, and the Abbasids in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=211}}</ref> Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries has been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, and humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from [[Samarra]] exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These predominantly being made for the Caliphs use. Tiles were also made using this same technique to create both monochromatic and polychromatic luster tiles.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\nEgypt being a center of the textile industry was part of Abbasid cultural advancement. [[Copt]]s were employed in the textile industry and produced linens and silks. [[Tinnis]] was famous for its factories and had over 5,000 looms. Examples of textiles were ''kasab'', a fine linen for turbans, and ''badana'' for upper-class garments.  The [[kiswah]] for the [[kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] was made in a town named [[Tuna (Egypt)|Tuna]] near Tinnis. Fine silk was also made in [[Dabik]] and [[Damietta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|p=216}}</ref> Of particular interest are stamped and inscribed fabrics, which used not only inks but also liquid gold. Some of the finer pieces were colored in such a manner as to require six separate stamps to achieve the proper design and color. This technology spread to Europe eventually.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|pp=216\u2013217}}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\n{{Main |Inventions in medieval Islam|Arab Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of Islamic science and technology}}\n[[File:Wasseruhr Harun al Raschid.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing a [[water clock]] given to [[Charlemagne]] by [[Harun al-Rashid]]]]\nIn technology, the Abbasids adopted [[papermaking]] from China.<ref name= Lucas/> The use of paper spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in [[al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) and then the rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than [[parchment]], less likely to crack than [[papyrus]], and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and copies of the Qur'an. \"Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cotter|2001}}</ref> It was from the Abbasids that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2003|p=166}}</ref> The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure [[potassium nitrate]] and an [[explosive]] gunpowder effect were first developed.<ref>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002}}</ref>\n\nAdvances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary [[sextant]] (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Abbasid sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large three masted merchant vessels to the [[Mediterranean]]. The name [[caravel]] may derive from an earlier Arab ship known as the ''q\u0101rib''.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwarz|2013}}</ref> Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the [[Mediterranean]], along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]] or [[Genoa]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through the Abbasid caliphate between China and Europe.\n\n[[File:Bruges Belgium Windmill-Bonne-Chiere-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Windmills]] were among Abbasid inventions in technology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UFhGW3MxgPMC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=abbasid+windmill#v=onepage&q=abbasid%20windmill&f=false|title=Syria|last=Phillips|first=Douglas A.|last2=Gritzner|first2=Charles F.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438132389|language=en}}</ref>|left]]\n\nEngineers in the Abbasid caliphate made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]], [[wind power]], and petroleum (notably by distillation into [[kerosene]]). The industrial uses of [[watermill]]s in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-[[Water wheel|wheeled]] and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from [[al-Andalus]] and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks.<ref name=Lucas>{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=10}}</ref> Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating [[crankshaft]]s, employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.<ref name=Hassan>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002a}}</ref> Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by [[manual labour]] in [[ancient times]] to be [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of waterpower had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded for the first time in [[Catalonia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lucas|2005}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nA number of industries were generated during the [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]], including early industries for textiles, sugar, rope-making, matting, silk, and paper. [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] passed on knowledge of chemistry and instrument making in particular.<ref>{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002b}}</ref> The agricultural and [[handicraft]] industries also experienced high levels of growth during this period.<ref name = Labib>{{harvnb|Labib|1969}}</ref>\n\n===Status of women===\nIn contrast to the earlier era, women in Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community's central affairs.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=112\u201315}} While their Muslim forbears led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the [[Hadith]] literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim conquest. Gorgias Press LLC, 2005</ref> many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\">Abbott, Nabia. Two queens of Baghdad: mother and wife of H\u0101r\u016bn al Rash\u012bd. University of Chicago Press, 1946.</ref> In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Nabia Abbott]], preeminent historian of elite women of the Abbasid Caliphate, describes the lives of harem women as follows.\n<blockquote>The choicest women were imprisoned behind heavy curtains and locked doors, the strings and keys of which were entrusted into the hands of that pitiable creature \u2013 the [[eunuch]]. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.\n\nElite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:\n:: To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.\n:: At times of disaster and catastrophe\n:: God multiplies rewards for the patient.\n:: To be patient in misery\n:: Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.\n:: Among the blessings of God undoubtedly\n:: Is the preservation of sons\n:: And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}\n\nEven so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic [[Rabia Basri|Raabi'a al-Adwiyya]] (714\u2013801 CE), the princess and poet [['Ulayya bint al-Mahdi]] (777\u2013825 CE), and the singing-girls [[Sh\u0101riyah]] ({{circa|815}}\u201370 CE), [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871 CE) and [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (797\u2013890 CE).<ref>{{cite book|last=Qutbuddin |first=Tahera |editor=Josef W.

Non-Muslims were called [[dhimmi]]<nowiki/>s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=27\u201330}}</ref> Dhimmis did not have all of the privileges that Muslims had and commonly had to pay [[jizya]], a tax for not being a Muslim. One of the common aspects of the treatment of the dhimmis is that their treatment depended on who the Caliph was at the time. Some Abbasid rulers, like [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (822 \u2013 861 CE) imposed strict restrictions on what dhimmis could wear in public, often yellow garments that distinguished them from Muslims.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=102\u2013103|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}</ref> Other restrictions al-Mutawakkil imposed included limiting the role of the dhimmis in government, seizing dhimmi housing and making it harder for dhimmis to become educated.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most other Abbasid caliphs were not as strict as al-Mutawakkil, though. During the reign of [[Al-Mansur]] (714 \u2013 775 CE), it was common for Jews and Christians to influence the overall culture in the [[Caliphate]], specifically in [[Baghdad]]. Jews and Christians did this by participating in scholarly work and Christians even influenced Islamic funeral service traditions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was common that laws that were imposed against dhimmis during one caliph's rule were either discarded or not practiced during future caliphs' reigns. Al-Mansur and al-Mutawakkil both instituted laws that forbade non-Muslims from participating in public office.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=108\u2013110|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}</ref> Al-Mansur did not follow his own law very closely, bringing dhimmis back to the Caliphate's treasury due to the needed expertise of dhimmis in the area of finance.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Sirry|first=Mun'im|date=2011|title=The public role of Dhimm\u012bs during \u02bfAbb\u0101sid times|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=74|issue=2|pages=187\u2013204|jstor=41287947|doi=10.1017/S0041977X11000024|doi-access=free}}</ref> Al-Mutawakkil followed the law banning dhimmis from public office more seriously, although, soon after his reign, many of the laws concerning dhimmis participating in government were completely unobserved or at least less strictly observed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Even [[Al-Muqtadir]] ({{r.|908|932 CE}}), who held a similar stance as al-Mutawakkil on barring non-Muslims from public office, himself had multiple Christian secretaries, indicating that non-Muslims still had access to many of the most important figures within the Caliphate.<ref name=\":2\" /> Past having a casual association or just being a secretary to high-ranking Islamic officials, many Caliphs like Al-Mansur would personally appoint dhimmis to important positions of power, like collector of revenue.\n\nJews and Christians may have had a lower overall status compared to Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate, but dhimmis were often allowed to hold respectable and even prestigious occupations in some cases, such as doctors and public officeholders. Jews and Christians were also allowed to be rich even if they were taxed for being a dhimmi.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dhimmis were capable of moving up and down the social ladder, though this largely depended on the particular caliph. An indication as to the social standing of Jews and Christians at the time was their ability to live next to Muslim people. While al-Mansur was ruling the Caliphate, for instance, it was not uncommon for dhimmis to live in the same neighborhoods as Muslims.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of the biggest reasons why dhimmis were allowed to hold prestigious jobs and positions in government is that they were generally important to the well-being of the state and were proficient to excellent with the work at hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> Some Muslims in the Caliphate took offense to the idea that there were dhimmis in public offices who were in a way ruling over them although it was an Islamic state, while other Muslims were at time jealous of some dhimmis for having a level of wealth or prestige greater than other Muslims, even if Muslims were still the majority of the ruling class.<ref name=\":2\" /> In general, Muslims, Jews, and Christians had close relations that could be considered positive at times, especially for Jews, in contrast to how Jews were being treated in Europe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of the laws and restrictions that were imposed on dhimmis oftentimes resembled other laws that previous states had used to discriminate against a minority religion, specifically Jewish people. Romans in the fourth century banned Jewish people from holding public offices, banned Roman citizens from converting to Judaism, and often demoted Jews who were serving in the Roman military.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate|last=Nicholls|first=William|publisher=Haddon Craftsmen|year=1993|isbn=9780876683989|location=Scranton|pages=196\u2013197}}</ref> In direct contrast, there was an event in which two [[vizier]]s, Ibn al-Furat and [[Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah]], argued about Ibn al-Furat's decision to make a Christian the head of the military.  A previous vizier, Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Bazuri, had previously done so. These laws predated al-Mansur's laws against dhimmis and often had similar restrictions, although Roman emperors were often much more strict on enforcing these laws than many Abbasid caliphs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism Before the Holocaust|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Pearson Educated Limited|year=2000|isbn=9780582369641|location=Harlow|pages=38}}</ref>\n\n===Arabization===\nWhile the Abbasids originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized, particularly in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region (namely [[Mesopotamia]] and [[the Levant]]) as had begun under Umayyad rule. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, many people from different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Ochsenwald|Fisher|2004|p=69}}</ref>\n\n==Military==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}\nIn Baghdad there were many Abbasid military leaders who were or said they were of [[Arabs|Arab]] descent.

Shortly thereafter, Berber [[Kharijite]]s set up an independent state in North Africa in 801. Within 50 years the [[Idrisid]]s in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Aghlabid]]s of [[Ifriqiya]] and a little later the [[Tulunid]]s and [[Ikshidid]]s of [[History of Muslim Egypt|Misr]] were effectively independent in Africa. The Abbasid authority began to deteriorate during the reign of [[al-Radi]] when their Turkic Army generals, who already had de facto independence, stopped paying the Caliphate. Even provinces close to Baghdad began to seek local dynastic rule. Also, the Abbasids found themselves to often be at conflict with the Umayyads in Spain. The Abbasid financial position weakened as well, with tax revenues from the [[Saw\u0101d]] decreasing in the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12137429|title=State, Land Tax and Agriculture in Iraq from the Arab Conquest to the Crisis of the Abbasid Caliphate (Seventh-Tenth Centuries)|first=Campopiano|last=Michele|volume=107|access-date=19 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913114643/http://www.academia.edu/12137429/_State_Land_Tax_and_Agriculture_in_Iraq_from_the_Arab_Conquest_to_the_Crisis_of_the_Abbasid_Caliphate_Seventh-Tenth_Centuries_in_Studia_Islamica_3_2012_35-80|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Separatist dynasties and their successors==\nThe Abbasid Caliphate differed from others in that it did not have the same borders and extent as Islam. Particularly, in the west of the Caliphate, there were multiple smaller caliphates that existed in relative peace with them.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} This list represents the succession of Islamic dynasties that emerged from the fractured Abbasid empire by their general geographic location. Dynasties often overlap, where a vassal emir revolted from and later conquered his lord. Gaps appear during periods of contest where the dominating power was unclear. Except for the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in Egypt, recognizing a Shia succession through [[Ali]], and the Andalusian Caliphates of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Umayyads]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], every Muslim dynasty at least acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of the Abbasids as Caliph and Commander of the Faithful.\n\n* Morocco: [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]] (788\u2013974) \u2192 [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] (1040\u20131147) \u2192 [[Almohad]]s (1120\u20131269) \u2192 [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] (1472\u20131554) \u2192 [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasids]] (1472\u20131554)\n* [[Ifriqiya]] (modern Tunisia, eastern Algeria and western Libya): [[Aghlabids]] (800\u2013909 CE) \u2192 [[Fatimid]]s of Egypt (909\u2013973 CE) \u2192 [[Zirids]] (973\u20131148) \u2192 [[Almohads]] (1148\u20131229) \u2192 [[Hafsids]] (1229\u20131574)\n* Egypt and Palestine: [[Tulunids]] (868\u2013905 CE) \u2192 [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] (935\u2013969) \u2192 [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909\u20131171) \u2192 [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1171\u20131250) \u2192 [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] (1250\u20131517)\n* [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Al-Jazira]] (modern Syria and northern Iraq): [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]] (890\u20131004 CE) \u2192 [[Marwanids]] (990\u20131085) and [[Uqaylids]] (990\u20131096) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1034\u20131194) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Ilkhanate]] (1231\u20131335)\n* Southwest Iran: [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]] (934\u20131055) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1034\u20131194) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] \u2192 [[Injuids]] (1335\u20131357) \u2192 [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]] (1314\u20131393)\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (modern Iran, Afghanistan and [[Turkmenistan]]): [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] (821 -873) \u2192 [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] (873\u2013903) \u2192 [[Samanids]] (903\u2013995) \u2192 [[Ghaznavids]] (995\u20131038) \u2192 [[Seljuks]] (1038\u20131194) \u2192 [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] (1011\u20131215) \u2192 [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmians]] (1077\u20131231) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Ilkhanate]] (1231\u20131335)\n* [[Transoxiana]] (modern [[Central Asia]]): [[Samanids]] (819\u2013999) \u2192 [[Karakhanids]] (840\u20131212) \u2192 [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmians]] (1077\u20131231) \u2192 [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (1225\u20131687)\n\n==Dynasties claiming Abbasid descent==\nCenturies after the Abbasids' fall, several dynasties have claimed descent from them, as \"claiming kinship relation with the Prophet Muhammad, that is, claiming an affiliation to the 'People of the House' or the status of a  sayyid or sharif, has arguably been the most widespread way in Muslim societies of supporting one's moral or material objectives with genealogical credentials.\"<ref name=\"ecommons.aku.edu\">https://ecommons.aku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=uk_ismc_series_emc</ref> Such claims of continuity with Muhammad or his Hashemite kin such as the Abbasids foster a sense of \"political viability\" for a candidate dynasty, with the intention of \"serving an internal audience\" (or in other words, gaining legitimacy in the view of the masses).<ref name=\"ecommons.aku.edu\"/> The final ruler of the [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] Indian princely state was particularly so.
