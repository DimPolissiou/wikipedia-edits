As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"Partimenti, or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti.\"  Monuments of Partimento \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education.  and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012).  Partimenti interest was helped by '''Alma Deutcher''' :Deutscher's early musical education focused on creative improvisation, as described by [[Robert Gjerdingen]]'s analysis of creative methods of teaching music to children in eighteenth-century Italy. According to the book, ''Musical Prodigies: Interpretations from Psychology, Education, Musicology, and Ethnomusicology'', Professor Gjerdingen sent exercises and commented on technical aspects of Deutscher's composition, while she had lessons in improvisation from the Swiss musician Tobias Cramm via [[Skype]], with the pair using the pedagogical method of the eighteenth-century Italian [[Partimento|partimenti]], instructional bass lines used for the teaching of harmony, counterpoint, and improvisation. Alma initially became fluent in the musical grammar of eighteenth-century music. Her father has said that she doesn't have regular instruction in formal [[Musical composition|composition]], rather that \"...there are good-hearted experts who help her sporadically and there's a lot of self-teaching.\" \n\n== How Partimento was Taught to children ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today.  \"Today's college music students are typically young adults from middle- or upper-class families. Almost none of them will earn a living writing for ensembles. It can take '''a decade''' to learn advanced counterpoint, but college classes can only last around a '''dozen weeks'''. So instead of learning how to produce classical music, the students and their teachers settle for learning \"about\" it much as they might learn about galaxies or bacteria. The compromise is called \"harmony.\" Music is described as being about a grammar of chords, and labelling such chords correctly will result in passing the course. The fact that collegiate harmony is '''largely a fiction''' can usually be ignored because '''students, teachers, and institutions''' all benefit from '''a pretense''' that nonethless allows almost every student to pass and graduate. Problems only arise if a student wants to ''make'' classical music. Then his or her lack of skill will become immediately apparent. Asking such collegiate music students to improvise a sonata, for instance, would be like asking them to fly.\" http://partimenti.org/\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rises to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Bass motions move in a conjunct (stepwise, including chromatic) motion or disjunct motion (sequences).{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=135}}\n\n=== Rises by a 3rd and falls by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 e d f e g f a g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 3rd and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 a b g a f g e f d e c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 3rd ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 f d g e a  f g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Falls by a 4th and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 g a e f c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 c fis, b e, a d, g c, d g,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 5th and rises by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 f, bes es, as d, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Rises by a 5th and falls by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 g' d a' e b' g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 6th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 a' d, b' e, c' f, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by semitone ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 fis f!

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nPartimenti, or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]],  Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rises to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Linda. The film opens with Knievel at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]]. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\n:''Ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars&nbsp;\u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row&nbsp;\u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter.\" That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the [[Wright Brothers]] to fly was impossible. And they probably told [[Neil Armstrong]] a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the [[Grand Canyon]] is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: \"If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.''\n\nFollowing his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel's life.\n\nThe film ends with Knievel successfully completing the jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon. (At the time of production, the real Evel Knievel was hyping a jump over the Grand Canyon.)\n\n==Monologue==\nAs the movie closes over the Grand Canyon, George Hamilton delivers a voice-over monologue in the Knievel character. In the monologue, he describes himself as the \"last gladiator\", which would later be used by the real Evel Knievel in his 1998 documentary, ''The Last of the Gladiators''.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the monologue from the movie:\n:''Important people in this country, celebrities like myself \u2014 [[Elvis]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[John Wayne]] \u2014 we have a responsibility. There are millions of people that look at our lives and it gives theirs some meaning. People come out from their jobs, most of which are meaningless to them, and they watch me jump 20 cars, maybe get splattered. It means something to them. They jump right alongside of me \u2014 they take the bars in their hands, and for one split second, they\u2019re all daredevils. I am the last gladiator in the new Rome. I go into the arena and I compete against destruction and I win. And next week, I go out there and I do it again. And this time \u2014 civilization being what it is and all \u2014 we have very little choice about our life. The only thing really left to us is a choice about our death.

While preparing to film it, he interviewed various stunt men for the lead role and heard about Knievel. He visited the stuntman in a San Francisco hospital and found him more fascinating than what he was writing. In 1970, Hamilton stated that:\n<blockquote>In America we've long had a theory that all men have an equal right to become everything they want. But there's a new theory being pushed on us - that every man has to be something whether he wants to or not. That's what the theory of Evil Knievel is about. He's an individual who doesn't care about establishment or hippie, both have their phony sides. I'm not sure why Evil does what he does on a motorcycle.

This was arguably the founding organization for the [[German Expressionist]] movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Der Blaue Reiter'' painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Auguste Macke]].

There were a number of groups of expressionist painters, including [[Der Blaue Reiter]] and [[Die Br\u00fccke]]. Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider, named for a painting) was based in Munich and Die Br\u00fccke was originally based in [[Dresden]] (although some members later relocated to [[Berlin]]). Die Br\u00fccke was active for a longer period than Der Blaue Reiter, which was only together for a year (1912). The Expressionists were influenced by various artists and sources including [[Edvard Munch]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[African art]].<ref>[[Ian Buruma]], \"Desire in Berlin\", ''New York Review of Books'', December 8, 2008, p. 19.</ref> They were also aware of the work being done by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] in Paris, who influenced Expressionism's tendency toward arbitrary colours and jarring compositions. In reaction and opposition to French Impressionism, which emphasized the rendering of the visual appearance of objects, Expressionist artists sought to portray emotions and subjective interpretations. It was not important to reproduce an aesthetically pleasing impression of the artistic subject matter, they felt, but rather to represent vivid emotional reactions by powerful colours and dynamic compositions. [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], the main artist of ''Der Blaue Reiter'' group, believed that with simple colours and shapes the spectator could perceive the moods and feelings in the paintings, a theory that encouraged him towards increased abstraction.<ref name=\"EHGombrich\" />\n\nThe ideas of German expressionism influenced the work of American artist [[Marsden Hartley]], who met Kandinsky in Germany in 1913.<ref>\"Hartley, Marsden\", Oxford Art Online</ref> In late 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], [[New York City]] received a great number of major European artists. After the war, Expressionism influenced many young American artists. [[Norris Embry]] (1921\u20131981) studied with [[Oskar Kokoschka]] in 1947 and during the next 43 years produced a large body of work in the Expressionist tradition.  Norris Embry has been termed \"the first American German Expressionist\".  Other American artists of the late 20th and early 21st century have developed distinct styles that may be considered part of Expressionism. Another prominent artist who came from the German Expressionist \"school\" was Bremen-born [[Wolfgang Degenhardt]]. After working as a commercial artist in Bremen, he migrated to Australia in 1954 and became quite well known in the Hunter Valley region.\n\nAmerican Expressionism<ref>Bram Dijkstra, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50866889&referer=brief_results ''American expressionism : art and social change, 1920\u20131950,''](New York : H.N.

The term \"expressionist\" is also sometimes used to refer to stylistic devices thought to resemble those of German Expressionism, such as [[film noir]] cinematography or the style of several of the films of [[Ingmar Bergman]].

In it, an unnamed man and woman struggle for dominance. The man brands the woman; she stabs and imprisons him. He frees himself and she falls dead at his touch. As the play ends, he slaughters all around him (in the words of the text) \"like mosquitoes.\" The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity all would become characteristic of later expressionist plays.<ref name=\"Graver1995\">{{cite book|author=David Graver|title=The Aesthetics of Disturbance: Anti-art in Avant-garde Drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ub69UFnyuSwC|accessdate=29 May 2018|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10507-8|page=65}}</ref> The German composer [[Paul Hindemith]] created an [[M\u00f6rder, Hoffnung der Frauen|operatic version]] of this play, which premiered in 1921.<ref name=\"Stewart1991\">{{cite book|author=John Lincoln Stewart|title=Ernst Krenek: The Man and His Music|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-5RqK8C__ysC|accessdate=29 May 2018|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07014-1|page=82}}</ref>\n\nExpressionism was a dominant influence on early 20th-century German theatre, of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. Important precursors were the Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]]. During the 1920s, Expressionism enjoyed a brief period of influence in American theatre, including the early modernist plays by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (''[[The Hairy Ape]]'', ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''The Great God Brown''), [[Sophie Treadwell]] (''[[Machinal]]'') and [[Elmer Rice]] (''[[The Adding Machine]]'').<ref name=\"Law2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Law|title=The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXMsAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=28 October 2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-4591-3}}</ref>\n\nExpressionist plays often dramatise the spiritual awakening and sufferings of their protagonists. Some utilise an [[Epic poetry|episodic]] [[dramatic structure]] and are known as ''Stationendramen'' (station plays), modeled on the presentation of the suffering and death of [[Jesus]] in the [[Stations of the Cross]]. [[August Strindberg]] had pioneered this form with his autobiographical trilogy ''[[To Damascus]]''. These plays also often dramatise the struggle against bourgeois values and established authority, frequently personified by the Father. In Sorge's ''[[The Beggar]]'', (''Der Bettler''), for example, the young hero's mentally ill father raves about the prospect of mining the riches of Mars and is finally poisoned by his son. In Bronnen's ''[[Parricide]]'' (''Vatermord''), the son stabs his tyrannical father to death, only to have to fend off the frenzied sexual overtures of his mother.<ref name=\"Styan1983\">{{cite book|author=J.

Director [[Leopold Jessner]] became famous for his expressionistic productions, often set on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (having borrowed the idea from the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] director and designer, [[Edward Gordon Craig]]). Staging was especially important in Expressionist drama, with directors forgoing the illusion of reality to block actors in as close to two-dimensional movement. Directors also made heavy use of lighting effects to create stark contrast and as another method to heavily emphasize emotion and convey the play or a scene's message.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fulton|first=A.

This was arguably the founding organization for the [[German Expressionist]] movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Der Blaue Reiter'' painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Auguste Macke]].

There were a number of groups of expressionist painters, including [[Der Blaue Reiter]] and [[Die Br\u00fccke]]. Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider, named for a painting) was based in Munich and Die Br\u00fccke was originally based in [[Dresden]] (although some members later relocated to [[Berlin]]). Die Br\u00fccke was active for a longer period than Der Blaue Reiter, which was only together for a year (1912). The Expressionists were influenced by various artists and sources including [[Edvard Munch]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[African art]].<ref>[[Ian Buruma]], \"Desire in Berlin\", ''New York Review of Books'', December 8, 2008, p. 19.</ref> They were also aware of the work being done by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] in Paris, who influenced Expressionism's tendency toward arbitrary colours and jarring compositions. In reaction and opposition to French Impressionism, which emphasized the rendering of the visual appearance of objects, Expressionist artists sought to portray emotions and subjective interpretations. It was not important to reproduce an aesthetically pleasing impression of the artistic subject matter, they felt, but rather to represent vivid emotional reactions by powerful colours and dynamic compositions. [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], the main artist of ''Der Blaue Reiter'' group, believed that with simple colours and shapes the spectator could perceive the moods and feelings in the paintings, a theory that encouraged him towards increased abstraction.<ref name=\"EHGombrich\" />\n\nThe ideas of German expressionism influenced the work of American artist [[Marsden Hartley]], who met Kandinsky in Germany in 1913.<ref>\"Hartley, Marsden\", Oxford Art Online</ref> In late 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], [[New York City]] received a great number of major European artists. After the war, Expressionism influenced many young American artists. [[Norris Embry]] (1921\u20131981) studied with [[Oskar Kokoschka]] in 1947 and during the next 43 years produced a large body of work in the Expressionist tradition.  Norris Embry has been termed \"the first American German Expressionist\".  Other American artists of the late 20th and early 21st century have developed distinct styles that may be considered part of Expressionism. Another prominent artist who came from the German Expressionist \"school\" was Bremen-born [[Wolfgang Degenhardt]]. After working as a commercial artist in Bremen, he migrated to Australia in 1954 and became quite well known in the Hunter Valley region.\n\nAmerican Expressionism<ref>Bram Dijkstra, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50866889&referer=brief_results ''American expressionism : art and social change, 1920\u20131950,''](New York : H.N.

In it, an unnamed man and woman struggle for dominance. The man brands the woman; she stabs and imprisons him. He frees himself and she falls dead at his touch. As the play ends, he slaughters all around him (in the words of the text) \"like mosquitoes.\" The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity all would become characteristic of later expressionist plays.<ref name=\"Graver1995\">{{cite book|author=David Graver|title=The Aesthetics of Disturbance: Anti-art in Avant-garde Drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ub69UFnyuSwC|accessdate=29 May 2018|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10507-8|page=65}}</ref> The German composer [[Paul Hindemith]] created an [[M\u00f6rder, Hoffnung der Frauen|operatic version]] of this play, which premiered in 1921.<ref name=\"Stewart1991\">{{cite book|author=John Lincoln Stewart|title=Ernst Krenek: The Man and His Music|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-5RqK8C__ysC|accessdate=29 May 2018|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07014-1|page=82}}</ref>\n\nExpressionism was a dominant influence on early 20th-century German theatre, of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. Important precursors were the Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]]. During the 1920s, Expressionism enjoyed a brief period of influence in American theatre, including the early modernist plays by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (''[[The Hairy Ape]]'', ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''The Great God Brown''), [[Sophie Treadwell]] (''[[Machinal]]'') and [[Elmer Rice]] (''[[The Adding Machine]]'').<ref name=\"Law2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Law|title=The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXMsAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=28 October 2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-4591-3}}</ref>\n\nExpressionist plays often dramatise the spiritual awakening and sufferings of their protagonists. Some utilise an [[Epic poetry|episodic]] [[dramatic structure]] and are known as ''Stationendramen'' (station plays), modeled on the presentation of the suffering and death of [[Jesus]] in the [[Stations of the Cross]]. [[August Strindberg]] had pioneered this form with his autobiographical trilogy ''[[To Damascus]]''. These plays also often dramatise the struggle against bourgeois values and established authority, frequently personified by the Father. In Sorge's ''[[The Beggar]]'', (''Der Bettler''), for example, the young hero's mentally ill father raves about the prospect of mining the riches of Mars and is finally poisoned by his son. In Bronnen's ''[[Parricide]]'' (''Vatermord''), the son stabs his tyrannical father to death, only to have to fend off the frenzied sexual overtures of his mother.<ref name=\"Styan1983\">{{cite book|author=J.

Director [[Leopold Jessner]] became famous for his expressionistic productions, often set on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (having borrowed the idea from the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] director and designer, [[Edward Gordon Craig]]). Staging was especially important in Expressionist drama, with directors forgoing the illusion of reality to block actors in as close to two-dimensional movement. Directors also made heavy use of lighting effects to create stark contrast and as another method to heavily emphasize emotion and convey the play or a scene's message.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fulton|first=A.
