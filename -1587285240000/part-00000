It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties.

By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country.

The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully [[Sinicized]]; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"''People of Tang''\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}, {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbDdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=China: A Cultural and Historical Dictionary |first= Michael|last= Dillon |date=13 September 2013 |page=132 |isbn=9781136791413 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> For example, the sinicization and rapid development of [[Guangdong]] during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as ''Tong-yan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}) in Cantonese, while China is called ''Tong-saan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u5c71}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n|l=Tang Mountain|links=no}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZjruI0_XmcC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|author= H.

It is still used in [[Malaysia]] today, usually in a derogatory sense.\n\nAmong Taiwanese, ''Tang mountain'' (Min-Nan: Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f) has been used, for example, in the saying, \"has Tangshan father, no Tangshan mother\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd}}; {{zh|poj=\u016a Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f kong, b\u00f4 Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f m\u00e1}}).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title = The Concise History of Taiwan |edition = Chinese-English bilingual |year = 2007 |publisher = Taiwan Historica |location = Nantou City |isbn = 9789860109504 |page = 52 }}</ref><ref><span lang=\"zh-Hant\">{{holodict|60161|e=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd\u3002}}</span></ref> This refers how the Han people crossing the [[Taiwan Strait]] in the 17th and 18th centuries were mostly men, and that many of their offspring would be through intermarriage with [[Taiwanese aborigine]] women.\n\nIn [[Okinawan language|Ryukyuan]], [[Karate]] was originally called ''tii'' ({{lang|xug|\u624b}}, hand) or ''karatii'' ({{lang|xug|\u5510\u624b}}, Tang hand) because {{lang|xug|\u5510\u306c\u570b}} ''too-nu-kuku'' or ''kara-nu-kuku'' ({{lang|xug|\u5510\u306c\u570b}}) was a common [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] name for China; it was changed to ''karate'' ({{lang|xug|\u7a7a\u624b}}, open hand) to appeal to Japanese people after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\n=== Dalu and Neidi ===\n''D\u00e0l\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5927\u9678}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u5927\u9646}}; {{zh|p=d\u00e0l\u00f9}}), literally \"big continent\" or \"mainland\" in this context, is used as a short form of ''Zh\u014dngg\u00fao D\u00e0l\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646}}, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and/or [[Taiwan]]. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term ''Neidi'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5185\u5730}}; {{zh|p=n\u00e8id\u00ec}}, literally \"the inner land\"). While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the

China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China.

During the campaigns of [[Hulagu]] (the grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]) in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] (1256\u201365), and the reigns of his successors, Chinese [[engineer]]s were employed on the banks of the [[Tigris]], and Chinese [[astrologer]]s and physicians could be consulted. Many [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] communications passed between the Hulaguid [[Ilkhan]]s and Christian princes. The former, as the great khan's liegemen, still received from him their [[seal (device)|seals]] of state; and two of their letters which survive in the archives of France exhibit the vermilion impressions of those seals in [[Chinese character]]s\u2014perhaps affording the earliest specimen of those characters to reach western Europe.\n\n=== Tabgach ===\nThe word ''[[Tabgach]]'' came from the metatheses of ''[[Tuoba]]'' (''*t'akbat''), a dominant tribe of the [[Xianbei]], and the surname of the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in the 5th century before sinicisation. It referred to Northern China, which was dominated by half-Xianbei, half-Chinese people.\n\n* [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]]: ''Taugats''\n* [[Old Turkic language|Orhon Kok-Turk]]: ''Tabgach'' (variations ''Tamgach'')\n\n=== Nikan ===\n''Nikan'' ([[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|\u1828\u1873\u1874\u1820\u1828}}, means\"Han ethnicity\")  was a Manchu ethnonym of unknown origin that referred specifically to the ethnic group known in English as the [[Han Chinese]]; the stem of this word was also conjugated as a verb, ''nikara(-mbi)'', and used to mean \"to speak the [[Chinese language]].\" Since ''Nikan'' was essentially an [[ethnonym]] and referred to a group of people (i.e., a [[nation]]) rather than to a political body (i.e., a [[Sovereign state|state]]), the correct translation of \"China\" into the Manchu language is ''Nikan gurun'', literally the \"Nikan state\" or \"country of the Nikans\" (i.e., country of the Hans).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} <!-- cf Pamela Crossley, [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~crossley/comments_1.html Note on Nikan] -->\n\nThis exonym for the Han Chinese is also used in the [[Daur language]], in which it appears as ''Niaken'' ({{IPA|[njak\u0259n]}} or {{IPA|[\u0272ak\u0259n]}}).<ref>Samuel E. Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |title = Grounds of Judgment: Extraterritoriality and Imperial Power in Nineteenth-Century China and Japan |first = Par Kristoffer |last=Cassel |volume= |edition= |year = 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qlJpAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0199792122 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Chinas religionen ...|first=Rudolf |last=Dvo\u0159\u00e1k |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition=illustrated |year=1895 |publisher = Aschendorff (Druck und Verlag der Aschendorffschen Buchhandlung) |url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0199792054 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = New Qing Imperial History: The Making of Inner Asian Empire at Qing Chengde |first1=Ruth W. |last1=Dunnell |first2=Mark C. |last2=Elliott |first3=Philippe |last3=Foret |first4=James A |last4=Millward |volume=|edition=|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 1134362226 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|first=Mark C. |last=Elliott |volume=|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0804746842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Mandschusprache |first = Erich |last= Hauer |editor-first = Oliver |editor-last = Corff |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition = illustrated |year = 2007 |publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url = https://books.google.com/?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-3447055284 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |first = Joseph |last= Esherick |chapter=How the Qing Became China |title =Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia |first=Peter C. |last=Perdue |volume= |edition=reprint |year=2009 |publisher = Harvard University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0674042025 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Geoff |url = http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf |title = The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China' |journal = Sino-Platonic Papers |volume = 188 |date = May 2009 |accessdate= 4 October 2011 |ref=harv}} \n*{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion|year=2012 |title=Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute }}\n* {{cite book |last = Wilkinson |first = Endymion |year = 2015 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual, 4th edition |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center distributed by Harvard University Press |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674088467 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Die Eroberung von Qinghai unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Tibet und Khams 1717 -

[[China]], the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|p=191}} It is believed to be a borrowing from [[Middle Persian]], and some have traced it further back to [[Sanskrit]].  It is also thought that the ultimate source of the name China is the Chinese word \"Qin\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6}}), the name of the [[Qin dynasty|dynasty]] that unified China but also existed as a [[Qin (state)|state]] for many centuries prior.

It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]].

It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.\n\n== Official names ==\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=People's Republic of China\n|pic=PRC (Chinese characters.svg\n|piccap=\"People's Republic of China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=1.15\n|t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b}}\n|s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}\n|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|gr=Jonghwa Renmin Gonqhergwo\n|mps=J\u016bnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|w=Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2 J\u00ean\u00b2-min\u00b2<br />Kung\u2074-ho\u00b2-kuo\u00b2\n|tp=Jhonghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|myr=J\u016bnghw\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gw\u00f3\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2|-|r|en|2|.|m|in|2|-|g|ong|4|.|h|e|2|.|g|wo|2}}\n|sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> hua<sup>2</sup> Zen<sup>2</sup> min<sup>2</sup><br />Gong<sup>4</sup> hwe<sup>2</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n|bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca<br />\u3116\u3123\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3107\u3127\u3123\u02ca<br />\u310d\u3128\u3125\u02cb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u311c\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n|xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \u0698\u064c\u0645\u064d \ufed7\u0652\ufeee\u062d\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0639\n|zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0445\u04d9\u0433\u0443\u0439\n|poj=Tiong-h\u00f4a J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|tl=Tiong-hu\u00e2 J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|gan=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet\n|wuu=tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup> zin<sup>\u5e73</sup> min<sup>\u5e73</sup><br />gon<sup>\u53bb</sup> ghu<sup>\u5e73</sup> koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n|j=Zung1waa4 Jan4man4 Gung6wo4gwok3\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}<br />''or''<br />{{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}\n|y=J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok<br />''or''<br />J\u016bng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok\n|hsn=/tan<sup>33</sup> go<sup>13</sup> \u014bin<sup>13</sup> min<sup>13</sup><br />gan<sup>45</sup> gu<sup>13</sup> kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n|h=dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup> ngin<sup>11</sup> min<sup>11</sup><br />kiung<sup>55</sup> fo<sup>11</sup> gued<sup>2</sup>\n|phfs=Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 Ng\u00ecn-m\u00ecn<br />Khiung-f\u00f2-koet\n|buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 \u00ccng-m\u00ecng<br />G\u00ea\u0324\u1e73ng-hu\u00f2-gu\u00f3k\n|hhbuc=De\u0324ng-hu\u00e1 C\u00edng-m\u00edng<br />G\u0113\u0324ng-h\u00f3\u0324-go\u0324h\n|mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-u\u01ce N\u00eang-m\u011bng<br />G\u014d\u0324ng-u\u01ce-g\u014f\n|mong=[[File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, \u182a\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1833\u1821 \u1828\u1820\u1836\u1822\u1837\u1820\u182e\u1833\u1820\u182c\u1824 \u1833\u1824\u182e\u1833\u1820\u1833\u1824 \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u182f\u1824\u1830]]\n|monr=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus\n|tib={{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f67\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72<br />\u0f58\u0f50\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56}}\n|wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab\n|zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab\n|uig=\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u062e\u06c7\u0627 \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u062c\u06c7\u0645\u06be\u06c7\u0631\u0649\u064a\u0649\u062a\u0649\n|uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti\n|uyy=Junghua H\u0259l\u2c6a Jum\u2c68uriyiti\n|sgs=Junghua H\u00e4lk\u0302 Jum\u0125uriyiti\n|usy=\u0496\u0443\u04a3\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0425\u04d9\u043b\u049b \u0496\u0443\u043c\u04bb\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0438\u0442\u0438\n|zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz\n|mnc=\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873<br />\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820\u1873\u1875\u1864\u185d\u1828<br />\u1864\u1860\u1828\u1865\u185d \u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828\n|mnc_rom=Dulimbai niyalmairgen gunghe' gurun\n|showflag=p\n|order = st\n}}\n\nThe name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as \"'''Communist China'''\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe official name of

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"'''[[Taiwan]]'''\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u532a\u5340}}) by the ROC).

Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;

To these have been added other species believed to have died out following the arrival of humans, as well as a few species known from [[Holocene]] remains whose extinction dates are poorly constrained. The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles, supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.}}\n\nThe mammalian fauna of Madagascar is highly distinctive and largely [[endemic]].

(film)|film based on the book]], in which her teenage drug use is documented.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to her book, Felscherinow was born in [[Hamburg]], but her family moved to [[West Berlin]] when she was a child. They settled in [[Gropiusstadt]], a neighbourhood in [[Neuk\u00f6lln]] that consisted mainly of high-rise concrete apartment blocks where social problems were prevalent. Felscherinow's father frequently drank large volumes of alcohol and was abusive towards his two daughters while her mother was absorbed by an extra-marital relationship.<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nWhen she was 12 years old, she began smoking [[hashish]] with a group of friends who were slightly older at a local youth club. They gradually began using stronger drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and various forms of pills and she ended up trying [[heroin]]. By the time she was 14, she was heroin-dependent and a prostitute, mainly at West Berlin's then-largest railway station [[Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station|Bahnhof Zoo]]. During this period, she became part of a group of teenage drug-users and sex workers of both sexes.\n\n==The making of ''Christiane F.''==\n\n===The book===\nTwo journalists from the news magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', [[Kai Hermann]] and [[Horst Rieck]], met Felscherinow in 1978 in Berlin when she was a witness in a trial of a man who paid underaged girls with heroin in return for sex. The journalists wanted to disclose the drug problem among teenagers in Berlin, which was severe but also surrounded by strong taboos, and arranged a two-hour interview with Felscherinow. The two hours extended to two months, as Felscherinow provided an in-depth description of her life, as well as those of other teenagers, in West Berlin during the 1970s. The journalists subsequently ran a series of articles about her heroin use in ''Stern'', based on the tape-recorded interviews with Felscherinow.\n\nIn 1979, the ''Stern'' publishing house published a book based on the interviews, ''Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo''. The book chronicles Felscherinow's life from 1975 to 1978, between the ages of 12 and 15 years, and depicts several of Felscherinow's friends, along with other drug users, as well as scenes from typical locations of the Berlin drug scene at the time. The narrative of the book is in the [[First-person narrative|first person]], from Felscherinow's [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint]], but was written by the journalists functioning as [[ghostwriter]]s.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954753,00.html |title=West Germany: Christiane F. Teen-age heroine in Berlin |publisher=TIME |date=1981-05-04 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> Others, such as Felscherinow's mother and various people who witnessed the escalating drug situation in Berlin at the time, also contributed to the book.\n\nThe UK issue of the book was released by Corgi on 21 August 1981 under the title ''H. Autobiography of a Child Prostitute and Heroin Addict'' and was translated by Susanne Flatauer.\n\nThe American issue of the book was released by Bantam in 1982 under the title ''Christiane F.: Autobiography of a Girl of the Streets and Heroin Addict'' and was translated by Susanne Flatauer. As of October 2013, Felscherinow continues to receive monthly royalty payments of \u20ac2,000 (US$2,720) for the book ''Christiane F.''<ref name=\"Kat\" />\n\n===The film===\nIn 1981, the book was adapted into a film that was directed by [[Uli Edel]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]] and [[Hans Weth]]. The screenplay was written by [[Herman Weigel]] and [[Natja Brunckhorst]] played the role of the titular character. Its title in Germany was ''[[Christiane F. (film)|Christiane F. \u2013 Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo]]'', and in English-speaking countries ''Christiane F.''<ref>{{cite news|title=Christiane F wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo (1982)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/9500/Christiane-F-wir-Kinder-vom-Bahnhof-Zoo/details|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the movie is shot in the actual surroundings of Gropiusstadt and Bahnhof Zoo. [[David Bowie]], Christiane's favorite singer at the time of the interviews that informed the book, appears as himself in a concert. Bowie also provided the movie's [[Christiane F. (album)|soundtrack]] that was released in Germany in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bowie \u2013 Original Soundtrack Zum Film \"Christiane F. - Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo\"|url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Original-Soundtrack-Zum-Film-Christiane-F-Wir-Kinder-Vom-Bahnhof-Zoo/release/303280|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 December 2013|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a December 2013 interview, Felscherinow stated that she attended the German premiere of the film with Bowie, who picked her up in a chauffeured limousine: \"I thought David Bowie was going to be the star of my movie, but it was all about me.\" Felscherinow agreed that the film was an accurate portrayal of her life at the time, but revealed that she does not like the film \"that much\":\n\n<blockquote>\n... it doesn't describe how I grew up, how I was neglected by my parents. My father was a drinker and he abused my sister and me. He was choleric and my mom just did nothing, She was more into her affair with another man and her beauty. I was so lonely when I was a kid. I just wanted to belong; I was struggling with the world.<ref name=\"Vice\">{{cite web|title='I WILL DIE SOON; I KNOW THAT': MEETING THE REAL CHRISTIANE F|url=https://www.vice.com/read/christiane-felscherinow-interview|work=Vice|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=26 December 2013|author=Max Daly|date=10 December 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Post-''Christiane F.'' ==\nAfter the initial success of the book and the film, Felscherinow found herself becoming something of a celebrity, both in Germany and other countries in Europe. A subculture of teenage girls in [[Germany]] began to emulate her style of dress and spent time around the Bahnhof Zoo, which became an unlikely tourist attraction. This development concerned drug experts in the youth field, who feared that, despite the film's bleakness and numerous drug-related scenes (particularly those portraying the reality of heroin withdrawal), vulnerable teens might regard Felscherinow as a cult hero and [[role model]].\n\nBetween 1982 and 1985, Felscherinow lived in [[Zurich]] with the Keel family, owners of the [[Diogenes Verlag|Diogenes]] publishing house. During this time she met [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]], [[Patricia Highsmith]] and [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]].<ref name=zeit>{{cite news |title=\"Ich bereue \"Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo\"\" |author= |url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/panorama/ich-bereue-wir-kinder-vom-bahnhof-zoo-1.18194382 |newspaper=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |work= |date=29 November 2013|language=German}}</ref> In 2013 she explained that she \"lived between literature stars and the heroin scene\" and described [[Platzspitz park]] in Zurich as \"like Disney World for junkies\"; however, Felscherinow further explained that the area became \"a heap of garbage\" as people died after contracting the [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]] viruses, and rival gangs engaged in violent conflict.<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nIn the early 1980s, Felscherinow's boyfriend was [[Alexander Hacke]], from the German industrial band [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], and together they released two albums under the moniker [[Sentimentale Jugend (band)|Sentimentale Jugend]], including a cover version of the [[Rolling Stones]] song \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]\", on the Das Cassetten Combinat label.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentimentale Jugend - Wollt ihr die totale befriedigung|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FjVXmIZ-1g|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=13 July 2013|author=strugatsky|format=Audio upload|date=14 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sentimentale Jugend|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sentimentale+Jugend/-Releases/-Albums|work=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2013}}</ref> They also appeared together in the 1983 German film ''[[Decoder (film)|Decoder]]'', which also featured [[William S.

She also stated that she is glad that Hacke's life has become stable: \"I'm happy he got rid of his problems and has a family now.\"<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2013, Felscherinow released a new autobiographical book titled ''Mein Zweites Leben [My Second Life]''<ref>\"The new life of Christiane F\" http://www.bild.de/news/inland/drogen/christiane-f-mein-zweites-leben-autobiografie-32327556.bild.html Bild.de. 2013-10-09. Retrieved 2013-11-09.</ref> in which she elaborates on her life following the release of the ''Christiane F.'' book. In a promotional interview, prior to the autobiography's release date, Felscherinow revealed her motivation for writing the second book: \"No, there's no message [in the book]. It was just that I wanted to make a counterstatement. There was all that junk, all the headlines!

I'm quite sure it will. It describes how much pain I've had in my life, and [explains] that I will die a very early and painful death.<ref name=\"Vice\" /></blockquote>\n\nFelscherinow contracted hepatitis C from an infected needle in the late 1980s.

(film)|film based on the book]], in which her teenage drug use is documented.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to her book, Felscherinow was born in [[Hamburg]], but her family moved to [[West Berlin]] when she was a child. They settled in [[Gropiusstadt]], a neighbourhood in [[Neuk\u00f6lln]] that consisted mainly of high-rise concrete apartment blocks where social problems were prevalent. Felscherinow's father frequently drank large volumes of alcohol and was abusive towards his two daughters while her mother was absorbed by an extra-marital relationship.<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nWhen she was 12 years old, she began smoking [[hashish]] with a group of friends who were slightly older at a local youth club. They gradually began using stronger drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and various forms of pills and she ended up trying [[heroin]]. By the time she was 14, she was heroin-dependent and a prostitute, mainly at West Berlin's then-largest railway station [[Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station|Bahnhof Zoo]]. During this period, she became part of a group of teenage drug-users and sex workers of both sexes.\n\n==The making of ''Christiane F.''==\n\n===The book===\nTwo journalists from the [[news magazine]] ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', [[Kai Hermann]] and [[Horst Rieck]], met Felscherinow in 1978 in Berlin when she was a witness in a trial of a man who paid underaged girls with heroin in return for sex. The journalists wanted to disclose the drug problem among teenagers in Berlin, which was severe but also surrounded by strong taboos, and arranged a two-hour interview with Felscherinow. The two hours extended to two months, as Felscherinow provided an in-depth description of her life, as well as those of other teenagers, in West Berlin during the 1970s. The journalists subsequently ran a series of articles about her heroin use in ''Stern'', based on the tape-recorded interviews with Felscherinow.\n\nIn 1979, the ''Stern'' publishing house published a book based on the interviews, ''Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo''. The book chronicles Felscherinow's life from 1975 to 1978, between the ages of 12 and 15 years, and depicts several of Felscherinow's friends, along with other drug users, as well as scenes from typical locations of the Berlin drug scene at the time. The [[narrative]] of the book is in the [[First-person narrative|first person]], from Felscherinow's [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint]], but was written by the journalists functioning as [[ghostwriter]]s.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954753,00.html |title=West Germany: Christiane F. Teen-age heroine in Berlin |publisher=TIME |date=1981-05-04 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> Others, such as Felscherinow's mother and various people who witnessed the escalating drug situation in Berlin at the time, also contributed to the book.\n\nThe UK issue of the book was released by Corgi on 21 August 1981 under the title ''H. Autobiography of a Child Prostitute and Heroin Addict'' and was translated by Susanne Flatauer ({{ISBN|0552117722}} {{ISBN|9780552117722}}).\n\nThe American issue of the book was released by Bantam in 1982 under the title ''Christiane F.: Autobiography of a Girl of the Streets and Heroin Addict'' and was translated by Susanne Flatauer ({{ISBN|0553208977}}). As of October 2013, Felscherinow continues to receive monthly royalty payments of [[Euro|\u20ac]]2,000 ([[United States dollar|US$]]2,720) for the book ''Christiane F.''<ref name=\"Kat\" />\n\n===The film===\nIn 1981, the book was adapted into a film that was directed by [[Uli Edel]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]] and [[Hans Weth]]. The screenplay was written by [[Herman Weigel]] and [[Natja Brunckhorst]] played the role of the titular character. Its title in Germany was ''[[Christiane F. (film)|Christiane F. \u2013 Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo]]'', and in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries ''Christiane F.''<ref>{{cite news|title=Christiane F wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo (1982)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/9500/Christiane-F-wir-Kinder-vom-Bahnhof-Zoo/details|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the movie is shot in the actual surroundings of Gropiusstadt and Bahnhof Zoo. [[David Bowie]], Christiane's favorite singer at the time of the interviews that informed the book, appears as himself in a concert. Bowie also provided the movie's [[Christiane F. (album)|soundtrack]] that was released in Germany in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bowie \u2013 Original Soundtrack Zum Film \"Christiane F. - Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo\"|url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Original-Soundtrack-Zum-Film-Christiane-F-Wir-Kinder-Vom-Bahnhof-Zoo/release/303280|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 December 2013|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a December 2013 interview, Felscherinow stated that she attended the German premiere of the film with Bowie, who picked her up in a chauffeured limousine: \"I thought David Bowie was going to be the star of my movie, but it was all about me.\" Felscherinow agreed that the film was an accurate portrayal of her life at the time, but revealed that she does not like the film \"that much\":\n\n<blockquote>\n... it doesn't describe how I grew up, how I was [[child neglect|neglected]] by my parents. My father was a [[alcoholism|drinker]] and he abused my sister and me. He was [[Wikt:choleric|choleric]] and my mom just did nothing, She was more into her affair with another man and her beauty. I was so lonely when I was a kid.

A subculture of teenage girls in [[Germany]] began to emulate her style of dress and spent time around the Bahnhof Zoo, which became an unlikely tourist attraction. This development concerned drug experts in the youth field, who feared that, despite the film's bleakness and numerous drug-related scenes (particularly those portraying the reality of heroin withdrawal), vulnerable teens might regard Felscherinow as a cult hero and [[role model]].\n\nBetween 1982 and 1985, Felscherinow lived in [[Zurich]] with the Keel family, owners of the [[Diogenes Verlag|Diogenes]] publishing house. During this time she met [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]], [[Patricia Highsmith]] and [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]].<ref name=zeit>{{cite news |title=\"Ich bereue \"Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo\"\" |author= |url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/panorama/ich-bereue-wir-kinder-vom-bahnhof-zoo-1.18194382 |newspaper=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |work= |date=29 November 2013|language=German}}</ref> In 2013 she explained that she \"lived between literature stars and the heroin scene\" and described [[Platzspitz park]] in Zurich as \"like Disney World for junkies\"; however, Felscherinow further explained that the area became \"a heap of garbage\" as people died after contracting the [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]] viruses, and rival gangs engaged in violent conflict.<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nIn the early 1980s, Felscherinow's boyfriend was [[Alexander Hacke]], from the German industrial band [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], and together they released two albums under the moniker [[Sentimentale Jugend (band)|Sentimentale Jugend]], including a cover version of the [[Rolling Stones]] song \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]\", on the Das Cassetten Combinat label.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentimentale Jugend - Wollt ihr die totale befriedigung|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FjVXmIZ-1g|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=13 July 2013|author=strugatsky|format=Audio upload|date=14 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sentimentale Jugend|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sentimentale+Jugend/-Releases/-Albums|work=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2013}}</ref> They also appeared together in the 1983 German film ''[[Decoder (film)|Decoder]]'', which also featured [[William S.

She also stated that she is glad that Hacke's life has become stable: \"I'm happy he got rid of his problems and has a family now.\"<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2013, Felscherinow released a new autobiographical book titled ''Mein Zweites Leben [My Second Life]''<ref>\"The new life of Christiane F\" http://www.bild.de/news/inland/drogen/christiane-f-mein-zweites-leben-autobiografie-32327556.bild.html Bild.de. 2013-10-09.

In a promotional interview, prior to the autobiography's release date, Felscherinow revealed her motivation for writing the second book: \"No, there's no message [in the book].
