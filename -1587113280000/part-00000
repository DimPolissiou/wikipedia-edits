Hallucinations are different from [[illusion]]s and perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form. They may consist of simple sensations (such as lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or smells) or more detailed experiences (such as seeing and interacting with animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations). Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable.<ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n[[Auditory hallucination]]s, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis.\n \nUp to 15% of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations (though not all are due to psychosis). The prevalence in schizophrenia is generally put around 70%, but may go as high as 98%. Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 18% and 48%. During the early 20th century, auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency, but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia, although rates vary between cultures and regions. Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices. When voices are present, the average number has been estimated at three. Content, like frequency, differs significantly, especially across cultures and demographics. People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness, location of origin, and may settle on identities for voices. Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content, frequently related to sin. Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Stephen |last2=Escalona |first2=Rodrigo |last3=Keith |first3=Samuel |editor1-last=Sadock |editor1-first=Virginia |editor2-last=Sadock |editor2-first=Benjamin |editor3-last=Ruiz |editor3-first=Pedro| name-list-format = vanc |title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|chapter=Phenomenology of Schizophrenia}}</ref>\n\n[[Extracampine hallucination]]s are perception outside the sensory apparatus (e.g. a sound is perceived through the knee).<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nVisual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia, although rates as high as 55% are reported. The prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15%. Content frequently involves animate objects, although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting, shading, streaks, or lines may be seen. Visual abnormalities may conflict with [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] information, and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting. [[Lilliputian hallucinations]] are less common in schizophrenia, and occur more frequently in various types of encephalopathy (e.g., [[Peduncular hallucinosis]]).<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nA visceral hallucination, also called a cenesthetic hallucination, is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli. Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning, or re-arrangement of internal organs.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\n===Delusions===\nPsychosis may involve [[delusion]]al beliefs. A delusion is commonly defined as an unrelenting sense of certainty maintained despite strong contradictory evidence. Delusions are context- and culture-dependent: a belief which inhibits critical functioning and is widely considered delusional in one population may be common (and even adaptive) in another, or in the same population at a later time. Since normative views may themselves contradict available evidence, a belief need not contravene cultural standards in order to be considered delusional.\n\nPrevalence in schizophrenia is generally considered at least 90%, and around 50% in bipolar disorder.\n\nThe DSM-5 characterizes certain delusions as \"bizarre\" if they are clearly implausible, or are incompatible with the surrounding cultural context. The concept of bizarre delusions has many criticisms, the most prominent being judging its presence is not highly reliable even among trained individuals.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nA delusion may involve diverse thematic content. The most common type is a [[persecutory delusion]], in which a person believes that some entity is attempting to harm them. Others include delusions of reference (the belief that some element of one's experience represents a deliberate and specific act by or message from some other entity), delusions of grandiosity (the belief that one possesses special power or influence beyond one's actual limits), thought broadcasting (the belief that one's thoughts are audible) and thought insertion (the belief that one's thoughts are not one's own).\n\nHistorically, [[Karl Jaspers]] has classified psychotic delusions into ''primary'' and ''secondary'' types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).<ref name=Jaspers>{{cite book |last=Jaspers |first=Karl | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Karl Jaspers |others=Translated by J. Hoenig and M.W. Hamilton from German |title=Allgemeine Psychopathologie (General Psychopathology) |origyear=1963 | edition = Reprint |date=1997-11-27 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland |isbn=978-0-8018-5775-1}}</ref>\n\n===Disorganization===\n\nDisorganization is split into disorganized speech or thinking, and grossly disorganized motor behavior. Disorganized speech, also called formal [[thought disorder]], is disorganization of thinking that is inferred from speech. Characteristics of disorganized speech include rapidly switching topics, called derailment or loose association; switching to topics that are unrelated, called tangential thinking; incomprehensible speech, called [[word salad]] or incoherence. Disorganized motor behavior includes repetitive, odd, or sometimes purposeless movement. Disorganized motor behavior rarely includes catatonia, and although it was a historically prominent symptom, it is rarely seen today. Whether this is due to historically used treatments or the lack thereof is unknown.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n[[Catatonia]] describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior. The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake. This type of catatonia presents with [[waxy flexibility]]. Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there).\n\nThe other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above. It involves excessive and purposeless motor behaviour, as well as extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality. An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. In both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.\n\n===Negative symptoms===\n\nNegative symptoms include reduced emotional expression, [[avolition|decreased motivation]], and [[alogia|reduced spontaneous speech]].

The term \"cycloid psychosis\" was first used by Karl Kleist in 1926. Despite the significant clinical relevance, this diagnosis is neglected both in literature and in nosology. The cycloid psychosis has attracted much interest in the international literature of the past 50 years, but the number of scientific studies have greatly decreased over the past 15 years, possibly partly explained by the misconception that the diagnosis has been incorporated in current diagnostic classification systems. The cycloid psychosis is therefore only partially described in the diagnostic classification systems used. Cycloid psychosis is nevertheless its own specific disease that is distinct from both the manic-depressive disorder, and from schizophrenia, and this despite the fact that the cycloid psychosis can include both bipolar (basic mood shifts) as well as schizophrenic symptoms. The disease is an acute, usually self-limiting, functionally psychotic state, with a very diverse clinical picture that almost consistently is characterized by the existence of some degree of confusion or distressing perplexity, but above all, of the multifaceted and diverse expressions the disease takes. The main features of the disease is thus that the onset is acute, contains the multifaceted picture of symptoms and typically reverses to a normal state and that the long-term prognosis is good. In addition, [[diagnostic criteria]] include at least four of the following symptoms:<ref name=Marneros2004/>\n* Confusion\n* Mood-incongruent delusions\n* Hallucinations\n* Pan-anxiety, a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances\n* Happiness or ecstasy of high degree\n* Motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type\n* Concern with death\n* Mood swings to some degree, but less than what is needed for diagnosis of an [[affective disorder]]\n\nCycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 15\u201350 years of age.<ref name=Marneros2004/>\n\n===Medical conditions===\n\nA very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis, sometimes called ''secondary psychosis''.<ref name=\"Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis\"/> Examples include:\n* disorders causing ''[[delirium]]'' (''toxic psychosis''), in which consciousness is disturbed\n* neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities, including [[velocardiofacial syndrome]]\n* neurodegenerative disorders, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesser JM, Hughes S | title = Psychosis-related disturbances.

Activity in the [[ventral striatum]], [[hippocampus]], and ACC are related to the lucidity of hallucinations, and indicate that activation or involvement of emotional circuitry are key to the impact of abnormal activity in sensory cortices. Together, these findings indicate abnormal processing of internally generated sensory experiences, coupled with abnormal emotional processing, results in hallucinations. One proposed model involves a failure of feedforward networks from sensory cortices to the inferior frontal cortex, which normally cancel out sensory cortex activity during internally generated speech. The resulting disruption in expected and perceived speech is thought to produce lucid hallucinatory experiences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gregory|last2=Thompson|first2=Wesley|editor1-last=Swerdlow|editor1-first=Neal | name-list-format = vanc |title=Behavioral Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and its Treatment|publisher=Springer|pages=185\u2013189|chapter=Functional Brain Imaging in Schizophrenia: Selected Results and Methods}}</ref>\n\n===Delusions===\nThe two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions.

Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as [[frontotemporal dementia]], psychosis and [[Lewy body dementia]]. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.\n\nThe [[Aberrant salience|aberrant salience model]] suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli.

Hallucinations are different from [[illusion]]s and perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form. They may consist of simple sensations (such as lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or smells) or more detailed experiences (such as seeing and interacting with animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations). Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable.<ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n[[Auditory hallucination]]s, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis.\n \nUp to 15% of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations (though not all are due to psychosis). The prevalence in schizophrenia is generally put around 70%, but may go as high as 98%. Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 18% and 48%. During the early 20th century, auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency, but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia, although rates vary between cultures and regions. Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices. When voices are present, the average number has been estimated at three. Content, like frequency, differs significantly, especially across cultures and demographics. People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness, location of origin, and may settle on identities for voices. Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content, frequently related to sin. Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Stephen |last2=Escalona |first2=Rodrigo |last3=Keith |first3=Samuel |editor1-last=Sadock |editor1-first=Virginia |editor2-last=Sadock |editor2-first=Benjamin |editor3-last=Ruiz |editor3-first=Pedro| name-list-format = vanc |title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|chapter=Phenomenology of Schizophrenia}}</ref>\n\n[[Extracampine hallucination]]s are perception outside the sensory apparatus (e.g. a sound is perceived through the knee).<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nVisual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia, although rates as high as 55% are reported. The prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15%. Content frequently involves animate objects, although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting, shading, streaks, or lines may be seen. Visual abnormalities may conflict with [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] information, and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting. [[Lilliputian hallucinations]] are less common in schizophrenia, and occur more frequently in various types of encephalopathy (e.g., [[Peduncular hallucinosis]]).<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nA visceral hallucination, also called a cenesthetic hallucination, is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli. Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning, or re-arrangement of internal organs.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\n===Delusions===\nPsychosis may involve [[delusion]]al beliefs. A delusion is commonly defined as an unrelenting sense of certainty maintained despite strong contradictory evidence. Delusions are context- and culture-dependent: a belief which inhibits critical functioning and is widely considered delusional in one population may be common (and even adaptive) in another, or in the same population at a later time. Since normative views may themselves contradict available evidence, a belief need not contravene cultural standards in order to be considered delusional.\n\nPrevalence in schizophrenia is generally considered at least 90%, and around 50% in bipolar disorder.\n\nThe DSM-5 characterizes certain delusions as \"bizarre\" if they are clearly implausible, or are incompatible with the surrounding cultural context. The concept of bizarre delusions has many criticisms, the most prominent being judging its presence is not highly reliable even among trained individuals.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/>\n\nA delusion may involve diverse thematic content. The most common type is a [[persecutory delusion]], in which a person believes that some entity is attempting to harm them. Others include delusions of reference (the belief that some element of one's experience represents a deliberate and specific act by or message from some other entity), delusions of grandiosity (the belief that one possesses special power or influence beyond one's actual limits), thought broadcasting (the belief that one's thoughts are audible) and thought insertion (the belief that one's thoughts are not one's own).\n\nHistorically, [[Karl Jaspers]] has classified psychotic delusions into ''primary'' and ''secondary'' types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).<ref name=Jaspers>{{cite book |last=Jaspers |first=Karl | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Karl Jaspers |others=Translated by J.

Disorganized speech, also called formal [[thought disorder]], is disorganization of thinking that is inferred from speech. Characteristics of disorganized speech include rapidly switching topics, called derailment or loose association; switching to topics that are unrelated, called tangential thinking; incomprehensible speech, called [[word salad]] or incoherence. Disorganized motor behavior includes repetitive, odd, or sometimes purposeless movement. Disorganized motor behavior rarely includes catatonia, and although it was a historically prominent symptom, it is rarely seen today. Whether this is due to historically used treatments or the lack thereof is unknown.<ref name=\"Sadock Psychosis\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n[[Catatonia]] describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior. The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake. This type of catatonia presents with [[waxy flexibility]]. Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there).\n\nThe other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above. It involves excessive and purposeless motor behaviour, as well as extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality. An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. In both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.\n\n===Negative symptoms===\n\nNegative symptoms include reduced emotional expression, [[avolition|decreased motivation]], and [[alogia|reduced spontaneous speech]].

The term \"cycloid psychosis\" was first used by Karl Kleist in 1926. Despite the significant clinical relevance, this diagnosis is neglected both in literature and in nosology. The cycloid psychosis has attracted much interest in the international literature of the past 50 years, but the number of scientific studies have greatly decreased over the past 15 years, possibly partly explained by the misconception that the diagnosis has been incorporated in current diagnostic classification systems. The cycloid psychosis is therefore only partially described in the diagnostic classification systems used. Cycloid psychosis is nevertheless its own specific disease that is distinct from both the manic-depressive disorder, and from schizophrenia, and this despite the fact that the cycloid psychosis can include both bipolar (basic mood shifts) as well as schizophrenic symptoms. The disease is an acute, usually self-limiting, functionally psychotic state, with a very diverse clinical picture that almost consistently is characterized by the existence of some degree of confusion or distressing perplexity, but above all, of the multifaceted and diverse expressions the disease takes. The main features of the disease is thus that the onset is acute, contains the multifaceted picture of symptoms and typically reverses to a normal state and that the long-term prognosis is good. In addition, [[diagnostic criteria]] include at least four of the following symptoms:<ref name=Marneros2004/>\n* Confusion\n* Mood-incongruent delusions\n* Hallucinations\n* Pan-anxiety, a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances\n* Happiness or ecstasy of high degree\n* Motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type\n* Concern with death\n* Mood swings to some degree, but less than what is needed for diagnosis of an [[affective disorder]]\n\nCycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 15\u201350 years of age.<ref name=Marneros2004/>\n\n===Medical conditions===\n\nA very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis, sometimes called ''secondary psychosis''.<ref name=\"Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis\"/> Examples include:\n* disorders causing ''[[delirium]]'' (''toxic psychosis''), in which consciousness is disturbed\n* neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities, including [[velocardiofacial syndrome]]\n* neurodegenerative disorders, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesser JM, Hughes S | title = Psychosis-related disturbances.

Activity in the [[ventral striatum]], [[hippocampus]], and ACC are related to the lucidity of hallucinations, and indicate that activation or involvement of emotional circuitry are key to the impact of abnormal activity in sensory cortices. Together, these findings indicate abnormal processing of internally generated sensory experiences, coupled with abnormal emotional processing, results in hallucinations. One proposed model involves a failure of feedforward networks from sensory cortices to the inferior frontal cortex, which normally cancel out sensory cortex activity during internally generated speech. The resulting disruption in expected and perceived speech is thought to produce lucid hallucinatory experiences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gregory|last2=Thompson|first2=Wesley|editor1-last=Swerdlow|editor1-first=Neal | name-list-format = vanc |title=Behavioral Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and its Treatment|publisher=Springer|pages=185\u2013189|chapter=Functional Brain Imaging in Schizophrenia: Selected Results and Methods}}</ref>\n\n===Delusions===\nThe two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions.

Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as [[frontotemporal dementia]], psychosis and [[Lewy body dementia]]. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.\n\nThe [[Aberrant salience|aberrant salience model]] suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli.

Such therapies include [[insulin shock therapy]], [[cardiazol]] shock therapy, and [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Shorter|first=Edward|title=A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-24531-5}}</ref> Despite considerable risk, shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including [[schizophrenia]].

Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed [[aphasia]] or seizure disorders. Burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper.

Moniz's primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle's 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre- and post-surgical behavior was compared. Prior to the leucotomy, the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent.

[[Chlorpromazine]] (brand name: Thorazine) passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis. Although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963, the administration of chlorpromazine marked the advent of the [[dopamine antagonist]], or first generation antipsychotic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stip E | title = Happy birthday neuroleptics! 50 years later: la folie du doute | journal = European Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 115\u20139 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12052571 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00639-9 }}</ref> While clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features, the [[side effect]]s were particularly harsh, which included high rates of often irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms such as [[tardive dyskinesia]].

Thus, blocking dopamine receptors (namely, the dopamine D2 receptors) and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined pharmacologic goal of antipsychotics. Recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic [[delusion]]s or [[hallucination]]s, but rather attenuates the reward mechanisms involved in the development of delusional thinking; that is, connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas.<ref name=Kapur/> The author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation:\n{{quote|text=The model presented here is based on incomplete knowledge related to dopamine, schizophrenia, and antipsychotics\u2014and as such will need to evolve as more is known about these.|sign=Shitij Kapur|source=From dopamine to salience to psychosis\u2014linking biology, pharmacology and phenomenology of psychosis}}\n\nFreud's former student Wilhelm Reich explored independent insights into the physical effects of neurotic and traumatic upbringing, and published his holistic psychoanalytic treatment with a schizophrenic.
