Retrieved 26 Oct 2014.</ref> is a cross or [[crucifix]], especially the large [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifix]] set above the entrance to the [[chancel]] of a [[medieval]] church.<ref>\nCurl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, p. 658. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.\n</ref>\nAlternatively, it is a large sculpture or painting of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]].\n\n== Derivation ==\n''Rood'' is an archaic word for ''pole'', from [[Old English]] r\u014dd \"pole\", specifically \"[[cross]]\", from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*rodo'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''r\u014dda'', [[Old High German]] ''ruoda'' \"rod\".<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Rood\"</ref>\n\n''Rood'' was originally the only Old English word for the instrument of [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[crucifixion|death]]. The words ''cr\u00fac'' and in the North ''cros'' (from either [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Norse]]) appeared by late Old English; \"crucifix\" is first recorded in English in the [[Ancrene Wisse]] of about 1225.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Cross\", and \"Crucifix\"</ref> More precisely, the Rood or [[Holyrood (cross)|Holyrood]] was the [[True Cross]], the specific wooden cross used in Christ's crucifixion. The word remains in use in some names, such as [[Holyrood Palace]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Dream of the Rood|The Dream of the Rood]]''. The phrase \"by the rood\" was used in [[oath|swearing]], e.g. \"No, by the rood, not so\" in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 3, Scene 4).\n\nThe alternative term ''triumphal cross'' ({{lang-la|crux triumphalis}}, {{lang-de|Triumphkreuz}}), which is more usual in Europe, signifies the triumph that the resurrected [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (''[[Christ]]us triumphans'') won over death.<ref>Margarete Luise Goecke-Seischab / J\u00f6rg Ohlemacher: ''Kirchen erkunden, Kirchen erschlie\u00dfen'', Ernst Kaufmann, Lahr 1998, p. 232</ref>\n\n[[File:Gotland-Stenkumla-Kirche 09.jpg|thumb|The 800-year-old cross in the Church of Stenkumla on [[Gotland]] shows the origin of the name ''Christus triumphans'': the crucified figure wears a crown and \"shoes\".]]\n\n== Position ==\nIn [[church architecture]] the rood, or rood cross, is a life-sized crucifix displayed on the central axis of a church, normally at the [[chancel]] arch.

The cross is dressed or redecorated with locally obtained [[Buxus|box]] foliage. The rope-like garland is hung across the rood screen during the \"May Garland Service\".<ref name=Hole>Hole, 1978, pages 113\u2013114</ref>\n\nAn engraving from 1823 shows the dressed rood cross as a more open, foliage-covered framework, similar to certain types of [[corn dolly]], with a smaller attendant figure of similar appearance. [[Folklorist]]s have commented on the garland crosses' resemblance to human figures, and noted that they replaced statues of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St Mary]] and [[Saint James the Great]] which had stood on the rood screen until they were destroyed during the Reformation. Until the 1850s, the larger garland cross was carried in a [[May Day]] procession, accompanied by [[morris dance]]rs, to the former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Horton-cum-Studley|Studley]] [[priory]] (as the statue of St Mary had been, until the Reformation). Meanwhile, the women of the village used to carry the smaller garland cross through Charlton,<ref name=Hole/> though it seems that this ceased some time between 1823 and 1840, when an illustration in [[John Henry Parker|J.H.

The cross is dressed or redecorated with locally obtained [[Buxus|box]] foliage. The rope-like garland is hung across the rood screen during the \"May Garland Service\".<ref name=Hole>Hole, 1978, pages 113\u2013114</ref>\n\nAn engraving from 1823 shows the dressed rood cross as a more open, foliage-covered framework, similar to certain types of [[corn dolly]], with a smaller attendant figure of similar appearance. [[Folklorist]]s have commented on the garland crosses' resemblance to human figures, and noted that they replaced statues of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St Mary]] and [[Saint James the Great]] which had stood on the rood screen until they were destroyed during the Reformation. Until the 1850s, the larger garland cross was carried in a [[May Day]] procession, accompanied by [[morris dance]]rs, to the former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Horton-cum-Studley|Studley]] [[priory]] (as the statue of St Mary had been, until the Reformation). Meanwhile, the women of the village used to carry the smaller garland cross through Charlton,<ref name=Hole/> though it seems that this ceased some time between 1823 and 1840, when an illustration in [[John Henry Parker|J.H.

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday.

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal. The intended crewed use of L1/Zond spacecraft was documented in official Soviet sources for the first time but from 1968 until 1989 this and the Moon-landing [[N1-L3]] programs were classified and the Soviet government denied the existence of both. Near 1968 a rare open Soviet source ([[Big Soviet Encyclopedia]]'s Yearbook, Kosmonavtika small encyclopedia) sporadically referred to Zond's as tests of ''space ships'' for lunar missions in contrast to the ''space apparate'' term used by the Soviets for spacecraft not capable of carrying a crew.\n\n==Planned schedule==\n[[File:Proton-L1 (Zond) drawing.png|thumb|Proton 7K-L1 launch vehicle configuration]]\n\nAs of 1967, the Soyuz 7K-L1 launch schedule was:\n\nMission\n* 2P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 3P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 4L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - May 1967 (actually launched on 27 September 1967, booster failure)\n* 5L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - June 1967 (actually launched on 22 November 1967, booster failure)\n* 6L           - Crewed lunar flyby   - June or July 1767\n* 7L and 8L    - Crewed lunar flybys  - August 1967 (7L actually launched on 23 April 1968, as [[Zond 1968A]], booster failure; 8L actually launched on 21 July 1968, booster explosion)\n* 9L and 10L   - Crewed lunar flybys  - September 1967 (10L planned to launch as [[Zond 9]], cancelled)\n* 11L and 12L  - Crewed lunar flybys  - October 1967\n* 13L          - Reserve spacecraft (actually launched on 20 January 1969, as [[Zond 1969A]], booster failure)\n\nIn July 1968, it was proposed that L1 spacecraft would be launched every month, and the first crewed mission would be in December 1968 or January 1969 after 3 or 4 successful uncrewed flights. In December 1968, dates for three crewed L1 missions were set to March, May, and July 1969. Finally, in September 1969 one crewed L1 mission was formally set for April 1970.\n\n==Built spacecraft==\nFifteen Soyuz 7K-L1 were built:\n\n* s/n 1 - prototype not equipped with heat shield, intended to perfect orbital operation of the spacecraft without recovery of the capsule.

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal. The intended crewed use of L1/Zond spacecraft was documented in official Soviet sources for the first time but from 1968 until 1989 this and the Moon-landing [[N1-L3]] programs were classified and the Soviet government denied the existence of both. Near 1968 a rare open Soviet source ([[Big Soviet Encyclopedia]]'s Yearbook, Kosmonavtika small encyclopedia) sporadically referred to Zond's as tests of ''space ships'' for lunar missions in contrast to the ''space apparate'' term used by the Soviets for spacecraft not capable of carrying a crew.\n\n==Planned schedule==\n[[File:Proton-L1 (Zond) drawing.png|thumb|Proton 7K-L1 launch vehicle configuration]]\n\nAs of 1967, the Soyuz 7K-L1 launch schedule was:\n\nMission\n* 2P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 3P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 4L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - May 1967 (actually launched on 27 September 1967, booster failure)\n* 5L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - June 1967 (actually launched on 22 November 1967, booster failure)\n* 6L           - Crewed lunar flyby   - June or July 1767\n* 7L and 8L    - Crewed lunar flybys  - August 1967 (7L actually launched on 23 April 1968, as [[Zond 1968A]], booster failure; 8L actually launched on 21 July 1968, booster explosion)\n* 9L and 10L   - Crewed lunar flybys  - September 1967 (10L planned to launch as [[Zond 9]], cancelled)\n* 11L and 12L  - Crewed lunar flybys  - October 1967\n* 13L          - Reserve spacecraft (actually launched on 20 January 1969, as [[Zond 1969A]], booster failure)\n\nIn July 1968, it was proposed that L1 spacecraft would be launched every month, and the first crewed mission would be in December 1968 or January 1969 after 3 or 4 successful uncrewed flights. In December 1968, dates for three crewed L1 missions were set to March, May, and July 1969. Finally, in September 1969 one crewed L1 mission was formally set for April 1970.\n\n==Built spacecraft==\nFifteen Soyuz 7K-L1 were built:\n\n* s/n 1 - prototype not equipped with heat shield, intended to perfect orbital operation of the spacecraft without recovery of the capsule.

Most of the majority population of African Americans, who had supported the Republican Party during Reconstruction and the nineteenth century, had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised by Democrats]] under the 1895 state constitution and related laws. These raised barriers to black voter registration and voting in South Carolina, as did similar laws across the South. After excluding blacks from the political system, the white-dominated legislature passed [[Jim Crow]] laws imposing legal segregation. Most blacks did not recover the ability to vote until years after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nAs a result of the exclusion of black Republicans, white Democratic voters controlled elections in this state and others of the former Confederacy for decades, creating the [[Solid South]]. They elected Democratic presidential candidates by nearly unanimous margins of victory, while preserving all the power associated with apportionment based on total population.\n\nThe twenty years from 1948 to 1968 were transitional years for the politics of South Carolina and Bamberg County. President [[Harry Truman]] ordered integration of the military and took other initiatives on civil rights issues. Discontented with that direction, Southern [[Dixiecrat]] candidates twice carried the county, and Republican candidates carried the county three times in this timespan, twice before many African Americans began to vote.\n\nFollowing Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], as a consequence of the civil rights movement, most African Americans in Bamberg County entered the Democratic Party, which had supported enforcement of their rights on the national level. But they did not get to full voting strength in the county until after the 1972 presidential election, in which conservative whites carried the county for incumbent Republican President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. He had gained considerable support among whites in the South, a sign of what has become a nearly total shifting of their alliance to the Republican Party. In elections since 1972, the majority of county voters, now African American, have backed a Republican presidential candidate only once, voting for the popular incumbent [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Most of the majority population of African Americans, who had supported the Republican Party during Reconstruction and the nineteenth century, had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised by Democrats]] under the 1895 state constitution and related laws. These raised barriers to black voter registration and voting in South Carolina, as did similar laws across the South. After excluding blacks from the political system, the white-dominated legislature passed [[Jim Crow]] laws imposing legal segregation. Most blacks did not recover the ability to vote until years after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nAs a result of the exclusion of black Republicans, white Democratic voters controlled elections in this state and others of the former Confederacy for decades, creating the [[Solid South]]. They elected Democratic presidential candidates by nearly unanimous margins of victory, while preserving all the power associated with apportionment based on total population.\n\nThe twenty years from 1948 to 1968 were transitional years for the politics of South Carolina and Bamberg County. President [[Harry Truman]] ordered integration of the military and took other initiatives on civil rights issues. Discontented with that direction, Southern [[Dixiecrat]] candidates twice carried the county, and Republican candidates carried the county three times in this timespan, twice before many African Americans began to vote.\n\nFollowing Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], as a consequence of the civil rights movement, most African Americans in Bamberg County entered the Democratic Party, which had supported enforcement of their rights on the national level. But they did not get to full voting strength in the county until after the 1972 presidential election, in which conservative whites carried the county for incumbent Republican President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. He had gained considerable support among whites in the South, a sign of what has become a nearly total shifting of their alliance to the Republican Party. In elections since 1972, the majority of county voters, now African American, have backed a Republican presidential candidate only once, voting for the popular incumbent [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
