Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of very short wavelength.  In 1887, German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/hertzexperiment.html|title=Heinrich Hertz: The Discovery of Radio Waves|last=Rubin|first=J|website=Juliantrubin.com|accessdate=8 Nov 2011}}</ref> showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light:  [[standing wave]]s, [[refraction]], [[diffraction]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].  Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers around 1894-1895. He received the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his radio work. Radio communication began to be used commercially around 1900.  The modern term \"''radio wave''\" replaced the original name \"''Hertzian wave''\" around 1912.\n\n==Generation and reception==\n[[File:Dipole receiving antenna animation 6 800x394x150ms.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Animated diagram of a [[half-wave dipole]] antenna receiving a radio wave.

The [[electric field]] ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">E, green arrows</span>)'' of the incoming wave pushes the [[electron]]s in the rods back and forth, charging the ends alternately positive ''<span style=\"color:red;\">(+)</span>'' and negative ''<span style=\"color:blue;\">(\u2212)</span>''.  Since the length of the antenna is one half the [[wavelength]] of the wave, the oscillating field induces [[standing wave]]s of voltage ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">V, represented by red band</span>)'' and current in the rods. The oscillating currents ''(black arrows)'' flow down the transmission line and through the receiver (represented by the resistance ''R'').]]\n\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s when they are [[acceleration|accelerated]].  They are produced artificially by time-varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a specially-shaped metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. An electronic device called a [[radio transmitter]] applies oscillating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the power as radio waves.  They are received by another antenna attached to a [[radio receiver]].  When they strike the receiving antenna they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, creating tiny oscillating currents which are detected by the receiver. \n\n==Speed, wavelength, and frequency==\nRadio waves in a vacuum travel at the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1728.org/freqwave.htm|title=Electromagnetic Frequency, Wavelength and Energy ''Ultra'' Calculator|website=1728.org|publisher=1728 Software Systems|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|title=How Radio Waves Are Produced|publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory|NRAO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328011153/http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|archive-date=28 Mar 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref> When passing through a material medium, they are slowed according to that object's [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]].  Air is thin enough that in the Earth's atmosphere radio waves travel very close to the speed of light.\n\nThe [[wavelength]] is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field (wave's peak/crest) to the next, and is inversely proportional to the [[frequency]] of the wave. The distance a radio wave travels in one second, in a vacuum, is {{convert|299,792,458|m|sp=us}} which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal. A 1 megahertz radio signal has a wavelength of {{convert|299.8|m|sp=us}}.\n\n==Propagation characteristics==\n{{Main|Radio propagation}}\n{{radio sidebar}}\n\nRadio waves are more widely used for communication than other electromagnetic waves mainly because of their desirable [[radio propagation|propagation]] properties, stemming from their large [[wavelength]].<ref name=\"Ellingson2\">{{cite book|last1=Ellingson|first1=Steven W.|title=Radio Systems Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2016|pages=16\u201317|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMKSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22radio+wave%22|doi=|id=|isbn=1316785165}}</ref>  Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials, and by [[diffraction]] can bend around obstructions, and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.  \n\nThe study of [[radio propagation]], how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems.  Radio waves passing through different environments experience [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[diffraction]], and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain [[radio band]]s more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:<ref name=\"Seybold\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&pg=PA6|title=Introduction to RF Propagation|last1=Seybold|first1=John S.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=|isbn=0471743682|location=|pages=3\u201310|chapter=1.2 Modes of Propagation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n*''[[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]:'' This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions.  This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30&nbsp;MHz.  On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual [[horizon]] to about 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi).   This is the method used by [[cell phone]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[radar]].  By using [[dish antenna]]s to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point [[microwave radio relay|microwave relay]] links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon.   [[satellite ground station|Ground stations]] can communicate with [[artificial satellite|satellites]] and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.\n**''Indirect propagation'': Radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by ''[[diffraction]]'' and ''reflection''.<ref name=\"Seybold\" />  Diffraction allows a radio wave to bend around obstructions such as a building edge, a vehicle, or a turn in a hall.  Radio waves also partially reflect from surfaces such as walls, floors, ceilings, vehicles and the ground.  These propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, and [[wireless network]]s.  A drawback of this mode is ''[[multipath propagation]]'', in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths.  The waves [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]], often causing [[fading]] and other reception problems.\n*''[[Ground wave]]s:'' At lower frequencies below 2&nbsp;MHz, in the [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] bands, due to diffraction [[vertical polarization|vertically polarized]] radio waves can bend over hills and mountains, and propagate beyond the horizon, traveling as [[surface wave]]s which follow the contour of the Earth.   This allows mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon, out to hundreds of miles.  As the frequency drops, the losses decrease and the achievable range increases.  Military [[very low frequency]] (VLF) and [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) communication systems can communicate over most of the Earth, and with submarines hundreds of feet underwater.\n*''[[Skywave]]s:'' At [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] wavelengths, radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles ([[ions]]) in a part of the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]].   So radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon;  this is called \"skip\" or \"skywave\" propagation.  By using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved.  Skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Widely used during the first half of the 20th century, due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned.    Remaining uses are by military [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon (OTH) radar]] systems, by some automated systems, by [[radio amateur]]s, and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries.\n\n==Radio communication==\n{{main|Radio}}\nIn [[radio communication]] systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a [[radio transmitter]].<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\">{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio8.htm|title=How Radio Works|last=Brain|first=M|date=7 Dec 2000|website=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2009}}</ref>  The information signal can be an [[audio signal]] representing sound from a [[microphone]], a [[video signal]] representing moving images from a [[video camera]], or a [[digital signal]] representing data from a [[computer]].  In the transmitter, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates an [[alternating current]] oscillating at a [[radio frequency]], called the ''[[carrier wave]]'' because it serves to \"carry\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier, altering some aspect of it, \"piggybacking\" the information on the carrier.  The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].  The oscillating current pushes the [[electron]]s in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves.  The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a [[bandpass filter]] to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a [[demodulator]].  The recovered signal is sent to a [[loudspeaker]] or [[earphone]] to produce sound, or a television [[Display device|display screen]] to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a [[computer]] or [[microprocessor]], which interacts with a human user.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).  The [[bandpass filter]] in the receiver consists of a [[tuned circuit]] which acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a tuning fork.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n==Biological and environmental effects==\nRadio waves are ''[[ionizing radiation|nonionizing radiation]]'', which means they do not have enough energy to separate [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, [[ionization|ionizing]] them, or break [[chemical bond]]s, causing chemical reactions or [[DNA damage]].  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the [[infrared]] waves radiated by sources of heat such as a [[space heater]] or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes [[polar molecule]]s to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a [[microwave oven]] cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's [[resistivity]] and [[permittivity]]; it is given by a parameter called the ''[[skin depth]]'' of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45&nbsp;GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8&nbsp;cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of [[diathermy]] for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in [[hyperthermia]] treatment and to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the [[waveguide]] of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause [[cataract]]s.<ref name=\"Kitchen\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc|url-access=registration|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|last1=Kitchen|first1=Ronald|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750643552|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc/page/64 64]\u201365|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"VanderVorst\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV3FPLJoyzMC&pg=PA121|title=RF/Microwave Interaction with Biological Tissues|last1=VanderVorst|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Rosen|first2=Arye|last3=Kotsuka|first3=Youji|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=0471752045|location=|pages=121\u2013122|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Graf\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc_ACUbCqqQC&pg=PA234|title=Build Your Own Low-power Transmitters: Projects for the Electronics Experimenter|last1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F.|last2=Sheets|first2=William|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750672447|location=|pages=234|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Elder\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKIKAQAAMAAJ&pg=SA5-PA116|title=Biological Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation|last1=Elder|first1=Joe Allen|last2=Cahill|first2=Daniel F.|date=1984|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5.116\u20135.119|chapter=Biological Effects of RF Radiation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Hitchcock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOMWHnZ4h_cC&pg=PA178|title=Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies: A Handbook for Health Professionals|last1=Hitchcock|first1=R.

One can speak of an [[electromagnetic field]], and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic [[field strength]] at a measurement location.\n\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is ''power density''. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the [[far field]] zone of the radiation pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|title=Antenna & Tower Regulation Handbook|last=National Association of Broadcasters|date=1996|publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]], Science and Technology Department|isbn=9780893242367|pages=186|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501015942/https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|archivedate=1 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \"near field\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above.

Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can [[diffraction|diffract]] around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth ([[ground wave]]s), shorter waves can reflect off the [[ionosphere]] and return to earth beyond the horizon ([[skywave]]s), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a [[line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.\n\nTo prevent [[electromagnetic interference|interference]] between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), which defines radio waves as \"[[electromagnetic wave]]s of [[Frequency|frequencies]] arbitrarily lower than 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;[[GHz]], propagated in space without artificial guide\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://search.itu.int/history/HistoryDigitalCollectionDocLibrary/1.43.48.en.101.pdf|title=Radio Regulations|last=|first=|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]|year=2016|isbn=9789261191214|location=Geneva|pages=7|chapter=Ch. 1: Terminology and technical characteristics - Terms and definitions}}</ref> The [[radio spectrum]] is divided into a number of [[radio band]]s on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.\n\n[[File:Radio waves.svg|right|300px|thumb|Diagram of the [[electric field]]s (E) and [[magnetic field]]s (H) of radio waves emitted by a [[Monopole antenna|monopole]] radio transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] (small dark vertical line in the center).

Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of very short wavelength.  In 1887, German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/hertzexperiment.html|title=Heinrich Hertz: The Discovery of Radio Waves|last=Rubin|first=J|website=Juliantrubin.com|accessdate=8 Nov 2011}}</ref> showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light:  [[standing wave]]s, [[refraction]], [[diffraction]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].  Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers around 1894-1895. He received the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his radio work. Radio communication began to be used commercially around 1900.  The modern term \"''radio wave''\" replaced the original name \"''Hertzian wave''\" around 1912.\n\n==Generation and reception==\n[[File:Dipole receiving antenna animation 6 800x394x150ms.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Animated diagram of a [[half-wave dipole]] antenna receiving a radio wave.  The antenna consists of two metal rods connected to a receiver ''R''.  The [[electric field]] ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">E, green arrows</span>)'' of the incoming wave pushes the [[electron]]s in the rods back and forth, charging the ends alternately positive ''<span style=\"color:red;\">(+)</span>'' and negative ''<span style=\"color:blue;\">(\u2212)</span>''.  Since the length of the antenna is one half the [[wavelength]] of the wave, the oscillating field induces [[standing wave]]s of voltage ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">V, represented by red band</span>)'' and current in the rods. The oscillating currents ''(black arrows)'' flow down the transmission line and through the receiver (represented by the resistance ''R'').]]\n\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s when they are [[acceleration|accelerated]].  They are produced artificially by time-varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a specially-shaped metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. An electronic device called a [[radio transmitter]] applies oscillating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the power as radio waves.  They are received by another antenna attached to a [[radio receiver]].  When they strike the receiving antenna they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, creating tiny oscillating currents which are detected by the receiver. \n\n==Speed, wavelength, and frequency==\nRadio waves in a vacuum travel at the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1728.org/freqwave.htm|title=Electromagnetic Frequency, Wavelength and Energy ''Ultra'' Calculator|website=1728.org|publisher=1728 Software Systems|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|title=How Radio Waves Are Produced|publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory|NRAO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328011153/http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|archive-date=28 Mar 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref> When passing through a material medium, they are slowed according to that object's [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]].  Air is thin enough that in the Earth's atmosphere radio waves travel very close to the speed of light.\n\nThe [[wavelength]] is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field (wave's peak/crest) to the next, and is inversely proportional to the [[frequency]] of the wave. The distance a radio wave travels in one second, in a vacuum, is {{convert|299,792,458|m|sp=us}} which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal. A 1 megahertz radio signal has a wavelength of {{convert|299.8|m|sp=us}}.\n\n==Propagation characteristics==\n{{Main|Radio propagation}}\n{{radio sidebar}}\n\nRadio waves are more widely used for communication than other electromagnetic waves mainly because of their desirable [[radio propagation|propagation]] properties, stemming from their large [[wavelength]].<ref name=\"Ellingson2\">{{cite book|last1=Ellingson|first1=Steven W.|title=Radio Systems Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2016|pages=16\u201317|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMKSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22radio+wave%22|doi=|id=|isbn=1316785165}}</ref>  Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials, and by [[diffraction]] can bend around obstructions, and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.  \n\nThe study of [[radio propagation]], how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems.  Radio waves passing through different environments experience [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[diffraction]], and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain [[radio band]]s more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:<ref name=\"Seybold\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&pg=PA6|title=Introduction to RF Propagation|last1=Seybold|first1=John S.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=|isbn=0471743682|location=|pages=3\u201310|chapter=1.2 Modes of Propagation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n*''[[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]:'' This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions.  This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30&nbsp;MHz.  On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual [[horizon]] to about 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi).   This is the method used by [[cell phone]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[radar]].  By using [[dish antenna]]s to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point [[microwave radio relay|microwave relay]] links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon.   [[satellite ground station|Ground stations]] can communicate with [[artificial satellite|satellites]] and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.\n**''Indirect propagation'': Radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by ''[[diffraction]]'' and ''reflection''.<ref name=\"Seybold\" />  Diffraction allows a radio wave to bend around obstructions such as a building edge, a vehicle, or a turn in a hall.  Radio waves also partially reflect from surfaces such as walls, floors, ceilings, vehicles and the ground.  These propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, and [[wireless network]]s.  A drawback of this mode is ''[[multipath propagation]]'', in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths.  The waves [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]], often causing [[fading]] and other reception problems.\n*''[[Ground wave]]s:'' At lower frequencies below 2&nbsp;MHz, in the [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] bands, due to diffraction [[vertical polarization|vertically polarized]] radio waves can bend over hills and mountains, and propagate beyond the horizon, traveling as [[surface wave]]s which follow the contour of the Earth.   This allows mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon, out to hundreds of miles.  As the frequency drops, the losses decrease and the achievable range increases.  Military [[very low frequency]] (VLF) and [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) communication systems can communicate over most of the Earth, and with submarines hundreds of feet underwater.\n*''[[Skywave]]s:'' At [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] wavelengths, radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles ([[ions]]) in a part of the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]].   So radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon;  this is called \"skip\" or \"skywave\" propagation.  By using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved.  Skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Widely used during the first half of the 20th century, due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned.    Remaining uses are by military [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon (OTH) radar]] systems, by some automated systems, by [[radio amateur]]s, and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries.\n\n==Radio communication==\n{{main|Radio}}\nIn [[radio communication]] systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a [[radio transmitter]].<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\">{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio8.htm|title=How Radio Works|last=Brain|first=M|date=7 Dec 2000|website=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2009}}</ref>  The information signal can be an [[audio signal]] representing sound from a [[microphone]], a [[video signal]] representing moving images from a [[video camera]], or a [[digital signal]] representing data from a [[computer]].  In the transmitter, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates an [[alternating current]] oscillating at a [[radio frequency]], called the ''[[carrier wave]]'' because it serves to \"carry\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier, altering some aspect of it, \"piggybacking\" the information on the carrier.  The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].  The oscillating current pushes the [[electron]]s in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves.  The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a [[bandpass filter]] to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a [[demodulator]].  The recovered signal is sent to a [[loudspeaker]] or [[earphone]] to produce sound, or a television [[Display device|display screen]] to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a [[computer]] or [[microprocessor]], which interacts with a human user.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).  The [[bandpass filter]] in the receiver consists of a [[tuned circuit]] which acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a tuning fork.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n==Biological and environmental effects==\nRadio waves are ''[[ionizing radiation|nonionizing radiation]]'', which means they do not have enough energy to separate [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, [[ionization|ionizing]] them, or break [[chemical bond]]s, causing chemical reactions or [[DNA damage]].  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the [[infrared]] waves radiated by sources of heat such as a [[space heater]] or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes [[polar molecule]]s to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a [[microwave oven]] cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's [[resistivity]] and [[permittivity]]; it is given by a parameter called the ''[[skin depth]]'' of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45&nbsp;GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8&nbsp;cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of [[diathermy]] for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in [[hyperthermia]] treatment and to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the [[waveguide]] of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause [[cataract]]s.<ref name=\"Kitchen\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc|url-access=registration|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|last1=Kitchen|first1=Ronald|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750643552|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc/page/64 64]\u201365|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"VanderVorst\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV3FPLJoyzMC&pg=PA121|title=RF/Microwave Interaction with Biological Tissues|last1=VanderVorst|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Rosen|first2=Arye|last3=Kotsuka|first3=Youji|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=0471752045|location=|pages=121\u2013122|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Graf\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc_ACUbCqqQC&pg=PA234|title=Build Your Own Low-power Transmitters: Projects for the Electronics Experimenter|last1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F.|last2=Sheets|first2=William|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750672447|location=|pages=234|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Elder\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKIKAQAAMAAJ&pg=SA5-PA116|title=Biological Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation|last1=Elder|first1=Joe Allen|last2=Cahill|first2=Daniel F.|date=1984|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5.116\u20135.119|chapter=Biological Effects of RF Radiation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Hitchcock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOMWHnZ4h_cC&pg=PA178|title=Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies: A Handbook for Health Professionals|last1=Hitchcock|first1=R.

One can speak of an [[electromagnetic field]], and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic [[field strength]] at a measurement location.\n\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is ''power density''. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the [[far field]] zone of the radiation pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|title=Antenna & Tower Regulation Handbook|last=National Association of Broadcasters|date=1996|publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]], Science and Technology Department|isbn=9780893242367|pages=186|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501015942/https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|archivedate=1 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \"near field\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above. Power density is measured in terms of power per unit area, for example, milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). When speaking of frequencies in the microwave range and higher, power density is usually used to express intensity since exposures that might occur would likely be in the far field zone.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Portal|Radio|Telecommunication}}\n\n*[[Radio astronomy]]\n*[[Television transmitter]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|author-link=James Clerk Maxwell|date=1865|title=VIII.

It is named after the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] (which in turn was named for [[Gabriel (archangel)|Archangel Gabriel]]), founded by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]].  The city grew outward from the mission and in 1852 became the original township of Los Angeles County.  San Gabriel was incorporated in 1913. The city's motto is \"A city with a Mission\" and it is often called the \"Birthplace\" of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 39,718.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish to [[Alta California]], the area that is now San Gabriel was inhabited by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the ''Gabriele\u00f1o.''

Blake observed that the once great vineyards had fallen into wild disarray. Fences were in disrepair and animals roamed freely through the property. But the mission bells were ringing and the church was still in use.

It is named after the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] (which in turn was named for [[Gabriel (archangel)|Archangel Gabriel]]), founded by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]].  The city grew outward from the mission and in 1852 became the original township of Los Angeles County.  San Gabriel was incorporated in 1913. The city's motto is \"A city with a Mission\" and it is often called the \"Birthplace\" of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 39,718.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish to [[Alta California]], the area that is now San Gabriel was inhabited by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the ''Gabriele\u00f1o.''

In the city National Routes [[National Route 19 (Argentina)|19]] and [[National Route 158 (Argentina)|158]] intersect. It is the fourth most populated city in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, with about 59,000 inhabitants, and the head city of the [[San Justo Department, C\u00f3rdoba|San Justo Department]].\n\nSan Francisco is located on Cordoba and Santa Fe's provincial borders. The city is also located in a geographic depression. Frequently during the heavy summer rains the entire city floods with up to two feet of water that covers the city's streets. The city is  centered on Plaza San Martin which is a large brick plaza used for a variety of demonstrations and festivals. Most of the city streets are laid cobble stone that have been polished black from traffic.\n\n==History==\nThe town was founded on  9 September 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Iturraspe, as part of a colonization plan of the provincial government. The current location of the city is slightly south of the original settlement and dates from 1888. Around that same time railroads of the [[C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway]] reached the area. The settlement was officially declared a city in 1915. A large portion of the city's population is made up of immigrants and World War I and II refugees from Europe, a large concentration of them being from the region of [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]].\n\nSan Francisco was without running water services until the 1940s. It was also at this time that the city was connected by Route 19 with the provincial capitals of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. The old train tracks of the ''Central C\u00f3rdoba'' Railway were removed in the 1960s from what had become the city center, which was modernized.\n\n[[UN/LOCODE]] is ARSFO.\n\n==Economy==\nSan Francisco's economy is  centered on agriculture. However, there are also many metal work factories that create electrical panels (WEG [http://www.weg.net/ar]), parts for cars (ZF SACHS [http://www.sachs.com.ar/argentina.htm]), and tolvas (AKRON [https://web.archive.org/web/20080914050824/http://www.akron.com.ar/akron/empresa.php?id_leng=1]). Construction jobs and renovation projects make up the vast majority of jobs in San Francisco. Due to the high population of Italian immigrants there also exists several pasta factories. [[SanCor]] and [[Grupo Arcor]]  both have factories near the city limits. SanCor is one of the leading [[dairy]] producers in [[Argentina]] (along with competitor [[La Seren\u00edsima]]). It holds one fifth of the total production in the country, and 90% of the Argentine exports of dairy products. It is a large [[cooperative]] made up many smaller ones, based on the Argentine \"central milk basin\" around the border between the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]].

In the city National Routes [[National Route 19 (Argentina)|19]] and [[National Route 158 (Argentina)|158]] intersect. It is the fourth most populated city in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, with about 59,000 inhabitants, and the head city of the [[San Justo Department, C\u00f3rdoba|San Justo Department]].\n\nSan Francisco is located on Cordoba and Santa Fe's provincial borders. The city is also located in a geographic depression. Frequently during the heavy summer rains the entire city floods with up to two feet of water that covers the city's streets. The city is  centered on Plaza San Martin which is a large brick plaza used for a variety of demonstrations and festivals. Most of the city streets are laid cobble stone that have been polished black from traffic.\n\n==History==\nThe town was founded on  9 September 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Iturraspe, as part of a colonization plan of the provincial government. The current location of the city is slightly south of the original settlement and dates from 1888. Around that same time railroads of the [[C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway]] reached the area. The settlement was officially declared a city in 1915. A large portion of the city's population is made up of immigrants and World War I and II refugees from Europe, a large concentration of them being from the region of [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]].\n\nSan Francisco was without running water services until the 1940s. It was also at this time that the city was connected by Route 19 with the provincial capitals of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. The old train tracks of the ''Central C\u00f3rdoba'' Railway were removed in the 1960s from what had become the city center, which was modernized.\n\n[[UN/LOCODE]] is ARSFO.\n\n==Economy==\nSan Francisco's economy is  centered on agriculture. However, there are also many metal work factories that create electrical panels (WEG [http://www.weg.net/ar]), parts for cars (ZF SACHS [http://www.sachs.com.ar/argentina.htm]), and tolvas (AKRON [https://web.archive.org/web/20080914050824/http://www.akron.com.ar/akron/empresa.php?id_leng=1]). Construction jobs and renovation projects make up the vast majority of jobs in San Francisco. Due to the high population of Italian immigrants there also exists several pasta factories. [[SanCor]] and [[Grupo Arcor]]  both have factories near the city limits. SanCor is one of the leading [[dairy]] producers in [[Argentina]] (along with competitor [[La Seren\u00edsima]]). It holds one fifth of the total production in the country, and 90% of the Argentine exports of dairy products. It is a large [[cooperative]] made up many smaller ones, based on the Argentine \"central milk basin\" around the border between the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]].

This treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of [[San Diego Bay]], thus ensuring that the United States received all of this natural harbor.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.<ref name=coy>{{cite book |last=Coy |first=Owen C.; PhD |title=California County Boundaries |publisher=California Historical Commission |year=1923 |location=Berkeley |asin=B000GRBCXG}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Cleveland National Forest]] is spread across the central portion of the county, while the [[Anza-Borrego Desert|Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped [[backcountry]]. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of San Diego, California}}\n[[File:Mountlagunasmall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland National Forest]]]]\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of [[Mediterranean climate]] (CSa) to the north and [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) to the south and east.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and low rainfall ({{convert|9|\u2013|13|in|cm}} annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of {{convert|70|\u2013|78|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|55|\u2013|66|F|C}}. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average high temperatures of {{convert|66|\u2013|70|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|50|\u2013|56|F|C}}.\n\nThe climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in [[microclimate]]s. In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/gtg/ca/state/overview/county.html#1|title=About County Government|work=Guide to Government|publisher=League of Women Voters of California|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Some chartered cities such as [[San Diego]] and [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]] and [[Vista, California|Vista]] arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis.\n\nThe county government is composed of the elected five-member [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], several other elected offices and officers including the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]], the [[San Diego County District Attorney|District Attorney]], [[San Diego County Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk|Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk]], and [[San Diego County Treasurer/Tax Collector|Treasurer/Tax Collector]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such as the [[San Diego County, California Probation|Probation Department]]. In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].

This treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of [[San Diego Bay]], thus ensuring that the United States received all of this natural harbor.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.<ref name=coy>{{cite book |last=Coy |first=Owen C.; PhD |title=California County Boundaries |publisher=California Historical Commission |year=1923 |location=Berkeley |asin=B000GRBCXG}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Cleveland National Forest]] is spread across the central portion of the county, while the [[Anza-Borrego Desert|Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped [[backcountry]]. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of San Diego, California}}\n[[File:Mountlagunasmall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland National Forest]]]]\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of [[Mediterranean climate]] (CSa) to the north and [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) to the south and east.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and low rainfall ({{convert|9|\u2013|13|in|cm}} annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of {{convert|70|\u2013|78|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|55|\u2013|66|F|C}}. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average high temperatures of {{convert|66|\u2013|70|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|50|\u2013|56|F|C}}.\n\nThe climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in [[microclimate]]s. In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/gtg/ca/state/overview/county.html#1|title=About County Government|work=Guide to Government|publisher=League of Women Voters of California|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Some chartered cities such as [[San Diego]] and [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]] and [[Vista, California|Vista]] arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis.\n\nThe county government is composed of the elected five-member [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], several other elected offices and officers including the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]], the [[San Diego County District Attorney|District Attorney]], [[San Diego County Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk|Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk]], and [[San Diego County Treasurer/Tax Collector|Treasurer/Tax Collector]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such as the [[San Diego County, California Probation|Probation Department]]. In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].
