The Council has over 120 Member organisations in over 50 countries. As a representative body, the Assembly of its Members is its highest power and has the ultimate decision on all matters that govern the Council. The organisations that make up this membership are national-level Professional Associations, Educational Institutions and Promotional Bodies. As the core membership category, Professional Associations representing individual professional designers and design studios, have particular powers within the Assembly. \n\n[[File:ICO_Congress_1966.png|thumb|Icograda Congress 1966]]\n\n==International affiliations==\nico-D coordinates best international practices for professional design.

''ico-D Meetings'' offer a variety of ways for representatives of Members organisations and the design community to connect. ''ico-D Meetings'' are attended by, on average, 30-70 organisation representatives speaking on behalf of their design communities. There are several categories of Meetings that respond to specific needs.\n\n''ico-D Platform Meetings'' (PMs) gather ico-D Members at one place and time, every year, to explore common challenges and action for change. ''ico-D Regional Meetings'' (RMs) provide an opportunity for ico-D Members located in the same region to engage with the design community at the regional level on common topics and challenges. ''ico-D Special Meetings'' (SMs) foster collaboration and exchange between various promotion and valorisation entities (Design Weeks, Festivals, Museums, Cities, and more) to address overlapping challenges and objectives and to determine how the international design community can better collaborate to achieve mutual goals and tackle shared challenges.\n\n''ico-D General Meetings'' (GM) assemble Members on issues of governance and policy. The General Assembly (GA) and Annual General Meeting (AGM) happen on alternating years.\n\n<gallery>\nICO_RM2017_Santiago.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 Latin America\nICO_RM2017_Asean.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 ASEAN\nICO_RM2019_Porto_01.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\nICO_RM2019_Porto_02.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Professional design practice==\n\nThe International Council of Design maintains that design is a profession. Like architects, doctors or lawyers, they advocate that designers have obligations and responsibilities that they must adhere to, to maintain their professional standing. The Council advocates that the title of \u201cdesigner\" implies adherence to a code of professional behaviour that ties their professional practice to obligations towards society at large. \n\nThe Council publishes a series of white papers, Best Practice documents governing the professional conduct of the individual designer as well the organisation of [http://dash.ico-d.org/files/resources/BP/ICO_RES_BP_Organising_Design_Awards_Competitions.pdf design awards], [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_DesignConferenceGuidelines.pdf design conferences] and [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_ExhibitionGuidelines.pdf design exhibits]. One of these is a [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_CodeofConduct.pdf Code of Conduct for professional designers].\n\n\n==Publications==\nReflecting its origins as the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), the Council has a long history of having publications. The earliest iteration of this is \"Icographic\" which was founded in 1971 and subsequent iterations include \"Iridescent\" and \"Communication Design\".\n\n===Icographic===\nFounded by John Halas, and edited and designed by Patrick Wallis Burke, ''Icographic'' was a review of international visual communication. Published by Pergamon Press Limited (Oxford/ New York/ Paris/ Frankfurt). The publication was quarterly at its inception and then became bi-annual. In its inaugural issue it was stated that the new magazine \"intends to study this field [newsprint and publishing industries as well as television, cinema and computers] as well as examine the designer\u2019s role in it. It will attempt to serve as an organ expressing the designer\u2019s point of view in the new scene. It will attempt to reveal new ideas in the technical aspect of design and to become an essential information source in the area of visual communications to many of our members throughout the world.\"\n\n[[File:Icographic issue 1 (1971).png|thumb|Icographic issue 1 (1971)]]\n\nThere were 14 issues of ''Icographic'' printed between 1971 and 1978. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/icographic#icographic-1-1971 back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n<gallery>\nIcographic issue 2 (1971).png\nIcographic 08 (1974).png\nIcographic 12 (1978).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Iridescent===\n''Iridescent: Icograda Journal of Design Research'', was the second iteration of the Council's design research journal. Coined the \u201cprism on design research\u201d the publication aimed to break boundaries and was. Considered a new a global take on the future of design with the aim of \u201cbreaking boundaries\u201d, Iridescent was born out of the Council\u2019s strategic aim to develop communication design education by merging the interdisciplinary facets of theory, practice and research. Initiated by Russell Kennedy (Icograda President 2009\u20132011), Edited by Omar Vulpinari (Icograda Vice President 2009-2011) and printed by [[Fabrica]], this beautiful limited edition work includes papers by Elizabeth Tunstall, Lawrence Zeegan, Zhao Jian, and many more.\n\nThe journal existed in paper and digital form, running from 2009 to 2011. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/iridescent back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n===Communication Design===\nIn 2016, the third iteration of the journal, ''Communication Design, Interdisciplinary and Graphic Design Research'' was launched, a significant evolution that builds upon a dynamic publishing history in the Council. The initiative was led by Editor-in-chief Teal Triggs of the Royal College of Art and supported by an accomplished editorial team, including leading authors on design. Triggs aimed to revisit what we mean by the term \u2018communication design\u2019, and to take into consideration the nature of design as an ever-expanding and -becoming practice, noting that the future of design is broadening from the design of the visual to also include the design of sound, haptics, experiences and services. And as a result, she says \u201cit might be argued that the term \u2018communication design\u2019 better describes and supports a range of new kinds of practices, processes, and methods.\u201d The journal was published by Routledge/ Taylor Francis until 2019.\n\n\n==World Design Day==\nA concept developed in 1995 by Kim Paulsen (Vice President 1993-1995) to commemorate the foundation of the Council on 27 April 1963, the day was initially as \"World Graphics Day\", became \"World Communication Design Day\" in 2012 and has been \"World Design Day\" since 2015.\n\nThe goal of World Design Day is to challenge designers to reflect deeply on the well-being of people within their local environments, and to find innovative solutions to local needs by using design as a vehicle to honour diversity, transcend borders, and improve quality of life. Held annually on 27 April, participants worldwide are invited to gather, innovate, and live out a moment of design by organizing public events and initiatives.\n\n===Themes===\n* 2015: How are you designing today?\n* 2016: Design in Action!\n* 2017: Start Young\n* 2018: Kids can too!\n* 2019: Women in design\n* 2020: Be Professional!\n\n\n==Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration==\n\nThe Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration proclaims the potential of design to achieve global economic, social, environmental and cultural objectives and includes a dramatic call to action to professionals, educators and governments as well as a list of proposed projects.The signing ceremony of the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was conducted on 24 October 2017 in Montr\u00e9al (Canada). Ratified in the presence of three UN agencies (UNESCO, UN-Habitat, UN Environment) the document was signed by the fourteen international organisations and partners who collaborated to draft the document and four additional design organisations. The Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration lists in an Annex more than 600 national professional associations, universities and design promotion entities, from 89 countries, that are represented by these international organisations.\n\nThe Declaration is a Call to Action. On one hand, it is a call to governments, educators, civil and private sectors to engage with  design, utilise and recognise it through Design Advocacy, Development of Design Metrics, Development of Design Policies, Development of Design Standards, Enhancement of Design Education. It is also a call to designers themselves to step into a leadership role, reconceiving themselves as \u201cambassadors\u201d of end-users, calling for more Responsive, Responsible and Vigilant Design, and Recognition of Design in the face of global challenges.\n\nThe Montreal Design Declaration defines the '''Value of Design''' through eight bold propositions:\n# Design is a driver of innovation and competition, growth and development, efficiency and prosperity.\n# Design is an agent for sustainable solutions.\n# Design expresses culture. \n# Design adds value to technology.\n# Design facilitates change.\n# Design introduces intelligence to cities.\n# Design addresses resiliency and manages risk.\n# Design fosters development. \n\nAccording to then President of the International Council of Design, Mr David Grossman: \u201cThe Declaration reflects two grand achievements. For the first time, the design community, across many disciplines, is speaking with one voice. This consolidation permits the second achievement - the international agencies are eager to collaborate with a united design world. These achievements impact every designer.\u201d  The Montreal Design Declaration is a milestone marking the launch of a global collaborative effort to utilise the potential of design for the benefit of all, and concludes: \"All people deserve to live in a well-designed world.\u201d \n\nThe first Design Declaration Summit in Montr\u00e9al, where the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was signed was organised with a Steering Committee made up of the International Council of Design, the [[Ifhp|International Federation for Housing an Planning]] and the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]].\n\n\n==Secretariat==\n\nInitially based in London (United Kingdom), the Secretariat of the International Council of Design was in Brussels (Belgium) from 1999 to 2005, at which time it moved to Montr\u00e9al (Canada), where it still resides. The Montr\u00e9al Secretariat is situated on a pedestrian street in the old town part of the city at 50 rue le Royer West. \n\nThe Secretariat office is where all the staff of the Council is based.

From 2015 onwards, management of the Secretariat has been in the hands of Ana Masut. \n\n\n==Executive Board==\nico-D's Executive Board consists of individuals who are duly nominated and elected by ico-D's Member organisations at the biennial ico-D General Assembly. Members of the Executive Board serve in a volunteer position and donate their time and expertise to further Icograda's mandate. Board meetings are typically held four times a year in different locations around the world, usually in conjunction with regional meetings, seminars or other scheduled design events.\n\n===Executive Board 2019\u22122021===\n* Mr. Johnathon Strebly (Canada), President\n* Ms. Daniela Piscitelli (Italy), Secretary General\n* Ms. Rebecca Blake (Unites States), Treasurer\n* Mr. Essam Abu Awad (Jordan), Vice President\n* Mr. Jonas Liugaila (Lithuania), Vice President\n* Ms. Zinnia Nizar (Indonesia), Vice President\n* Mr. Ting Xu (China), Vice President\n* Mr. Chao Zhao (China), Vice President\n* Mr. David Grossman (Israel), Executive Board Member\n\n===Executive Board history===\nSince 1963 and 2016, 26 ico-D boards have donated their leadership skills and time to furthering ico-D's goals and objectives.

Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, \"but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991</ref>\n\nIcograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.\n\nAt the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 }}</ref> In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}</ref> by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that \"the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week.\"\n\nThe first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.\n\nIn 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.\n\nIn 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.\n\nIn 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from D\u00fcsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.\n\nIn 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.\n\nThe 1977 Zurich Congress \u2212 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' \u2212 was complemented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne \u2212 'A Town and its Image' \u2212 and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.\n\nIn 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar \u2212 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.

In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where \"I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable \u2013 the only answer\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.</ref> Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating \"rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to \u2013 but in that order \u2013 literacy\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> he called on the delegates to \"offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see \u2013 literally see \u2013 both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said \"I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task... History will once again make its awesome judgement of you \u2013 but from now on with greater respect because you cannot any longer be underestimated.

So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, \"a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry\". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over. At the 11th Icograda General Assembly (also in Nice) [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] was elected president. The President's Trophy went to Jan Railich, the chairman of the Brno Biennale.<ref name=\"icograda\" /> Also in 1985, the ''World Directory of Design Schools and Programmes'' was published jointly by Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and edited by Maarten Regouin, secretary of the Icograda Education Working Group, which also coincided with Icograda's establishment of the Design History and Design Management working groups chaired by Michael Twyman and Abe Rosenfeld respectively.\n\nIn 1986 Icograda Excellence Awards were made for the first time at the Brno and Warsaw Biennales.

[[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been \u201cthe most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years\u201d. Jeremy Myerson called it \"a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons\". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, \"Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is Yuri Soloviev's story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it \u2212 keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.<ref name=\"icograda\" />\n\nFrom 23\u201327 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto.

The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.\n\nIn 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15\u201316 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.\n\nIn March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting.

The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.\n\nThe ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8\u201311 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003\u22122005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.\n\nIn January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey.

Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations\u2019 Secretariates to Montreal.\n\nIn January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport \u2013 Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.\n\n''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.\n\nIn 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks. In January, ''So Tiny, So Many: Icograda Design Week in Hong Kong'' took place in China and consisted of a student workshop, an evening lecture series and a Regional Meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1025.htm |title=2006 - HONG KONG (CHINA) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> In July, ''Defining design on a changing planet: Icograda Design Week in Seattle'', took place in the USA.

The Council has over 120 Member organisations in over 50 countries. As a representative body, the Assembly of its Members is its highest power and has the ultimate decision on all matters that govern the Council. The organisations that make up this membership are national-level Professional Associations, Educational Institutions and Promotional Bodies. As the core membership category, Professional Associations representing individual professional designers and design studios, have particular powers within the Assembly. \n\n[[File:ICO_Congress_1966.png|thumb|Icograda Congress 1966]]\n\n==International affiliations==\nico-D coordinates best international practices for professional design.

''ico-D Meetings'' offer a variety of ways for representatives of Members organisations and the design community to connect. ''ico-D Meetings'' are attended by, on average, 30-70 organisation representatives speaking on behalf of their design communities. There are several categories of Meetings that respond to specific needs.\n\n''ico-D Platform Meetings'' (PMs) gather ico-D Members at one place and time, every year, to explore common challenges and action for change. ''ico-D Regional Meetings'' (RMs) provide an opportunity for ico-D Members located in the same region to engage with the design community at the regional level on common topics and challenges. ''ico-D Special Meetings'' (SMs) foster collaboration and exchange between various promotion and valorisation entities (Design Weeks, Festivals, Museums, Cities, and more) to address overlapping challenges and objectives and to determine how the international design community can better collaborate to achieve mutual goals and tackle shared challenges.\n\n''ico-D General Meetings'' (GM) assemble Members on issues of governance and policy. The General Assembly (GA) and Annual General Meeting (AGM) happen on alternating years.\n\n<gallery>\nICO_RM2017_Santiago.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 Latin America\nICO_RM2017_Asean.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 ASEAN\nICO_RM2019_Porto_01.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\nICO_RM2019_Porto_02.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Professional design practice==\n\nThe International Council of Design maintains that design is a profession. Like architects, doctors or lawyers, they advocate that designers have obligations and responsibilities that they must adhere to, to maintain their professional standing. The Council advocates that the title of \u201cdesigner\" implies adherence to a code of professional behaviour that ties their professional practice to obligations towards society at large. \n\nThe Council publishes a series of white papers, Best Practice documents governing the professional conduct of the individual designer as well the organisation of [http://dash.ico-d.org/files/resources/BP/ICO_RES_BP_Organising_Design_Awards_Competitions.pdf design awards], [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_DesignConferenceGuidelines.pdf design conferences] and [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_ExhibitionGuidelines.pdf design exhibits]. One of these is a [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_CodeofConduct.pdf Code of Conduct for professional designers].\n\n\n==Publications==\nReflecting its origins as the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), the Council has a long history of having publications. The earliest iteration of this is \"Icographic\" which was founded in 1971 and subsequent iterations include \"Iridescent\" and \"Communication Design\".\n\n===Icographic===\nFounded by John Halas, and edited and designed by Patrick Wallis Burke, ''Icographic'' was a review of international visual communication. Published by Pergamon Press Limited (Oxford/ New York/ Paris/ Frankfurt). The publication was quarterly at its inception and then became bi-annual. In its inaugural issue it was stated that the new magazine \"intends to study this field [newsprint and publishing industries as well as television, cinema and computers] as well as examine the designer\u2019s role in it. It will attempt to serve as an organ expressing the designer\u2019s point of view in the new scene. It will attempt to reveal new ideas in the technical aspect of design and to become an essential information source in the area of visual communications to many of our members throughout the world.\"\n\n[[File:Icographic issue 1 (1971).png|thumb|Icographic issue 1 (1971)]]\n\nThere were 14 issues of ''Icographic'' printed between 1971 and 1978. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/icographic#icographic-1-1971 back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n<gallery>\nIcographic issue 2 (1971).png\nIcographic 08 (1974).png\nIcographic 12 (1978).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Iridescent===\n''Iridescent: Icograda Journal of Design Research'', was the second iteration of the Council's design research journal. Coined the \u201cprism on design research\u201d the publication aimed to break boundaries and was. Considered a new a global take on the future of design with the aim of \u201cbreaking boundaries\u201d, Iridescent was born out of the Council\u2019s strategic aim to develop communication design education by merging the interdisciplinary facets of theory, practice and research. Initiated by Russell Kennedy (Icograda President 2009\u20132011), Edited by Omar Vulpinari (Icograda Vice President 2009-2011) and printed by [[Fabrica]], this beautiful limited edition work includes papers by Elizabeth Tunstall, Lawrence Zeegan, Zhao Jian, and many more.\n\nThe journal existed in paper and digital form, running from 2009 to 2011. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/iridescent back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n===Communication Design===\nIn 2016, the third iteration of the journal, ''Communication Design, Interdisciplinary and Graphic Design Research'' was launched, a significant evolution that builds upon a dynamic publishing history in the Council. The initiative was led by Editor-in-chief Teal Triggs of the Royal College of Art and supported by an accomplished editorial team, including leading authors on design. Triggs aimed to revisit what we mean by the term \u2018communication design\u2019, and to take into consideration the nature of design as an ever-expanding and -becoming practice, noting that the future of design is broadening from the design of the visual to also include the design of sound, haptics, experiences and services. And as a result, she says \u201cit might be argued that the term \u2018communication design\u2019 better describes and supports a range of new kinds of practices, processes, and methods.\u201d The journal was published by Routledge/ Taylor Francis until 2019.\n\n\n==World Design Day==\nA concept developed in 1995 by Kim Paulsen (Vice President 1993-1995) to commemorate the foundation of the Council on 27 April 1963, the day was initially as \"World Graphics Day\", became \"World Communication Design Day\" in 2012 and has been \"World Design Day\" since 2015.\n\nThe goal of World Design Day is to challenge designers to reflect deeply on the well-being of people within their local environments, and to find innovative solutions to local needs by using design as a vehicle to honour diversity, transcend borders, and improve quality of life. Held annually on 27 April, participants worldwide are invited to gather, innovate, and live out a moment of design by organizing public events and initiatives.\n\n===Themes===\n* 2015: How are you designing today?\n* 2016: Design in Action!\n* 2017: Start Young\n* 2018: Kids can too!\n* 2019: Women in design\n* 2020: Be Professional!\n\n\n==Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration==\n\nThe Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration proclaims the potential of design to achieve global economic, social, environmental and cultural objectives and includes a dramatic call to action to professionals, educators and governments as well as a list of proposed projects.The signing ceremony of the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was conducted on 24 October 2017 in Montr\u00e9al (Canada). Ratified in the presence of three UN agencies (UNESCO, UN-Habitat, UN Environment) the document was signed by the fourteen international organisations and partners who collaborated to draft the document and four additional design organisations. The Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration lists in an Annex more than 600 national professional associations, universities and design promotion entities, from 89 countries, that are represented by these international organisations.\n\nThe Declaration is a Call to Action. On one hand, it is a call to governments, educators, civil and private sectors to engage with  design, utilise and recognise it through Design Advocacy, Development of Design Metrics, Development of Design Policies, Development of Design Standards, Enhancement of Design Education. It is also a call to designers themselves to step into a leadership role, reconceiving themselves as \u201cambassadors\u201d of end-users, calling for more Responsive, Responsible and Vigilant Design, and Recognition of Design in the face of global challenges.\n\nThe Montreal Design Declaration defines the '''Value of Design''' through eight bold propositions:\n# Design is a driver of innovation and competition, growth and development, efficiency and prosperity.\n# Design is an agent for sustainable solutions.\n# Design expresses culture. \n# Design adds value to technology.\n# Design facilitates change.\n# Design introduces intelligence to cities.\n# Design addresses resiliency and manages risk.\n# Design fosters development. \n\nAccording to then President of the International Council of Design, Mr David Grossman: \u201cThe Declaration reflects two grand achievements. For the first time, the design community, across many disciplines, is speaking with one voice. This consolidation permits the second achievement - the international agencies are eager to collaborate with a united design world. These achievements impact every designer.\u201d  The Montreal Design Declaration is a milestone marking the launch of a global collaborative effort to utilise the potential of design for the benefit of all, and concludes: \"All people deserve to live in a well-designed world.\u201d \n\nThe first Design Declaration Summit in Montr\u00e9al, where the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was signed was organised with a Steering Committee made up of the International Council of Design, the [[Ifhp|International Federation for Housing an Planning]] and the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]].\n\n\n==Secretariat==\n\nInitially based in London (United Kingdom), the Secretariat of the International Council of Design was in Brussels (Belgium) from 1999 to 2005, at which time it moved to Montr\u00e9al (Canada), where it still resides. The Montr\u00e9al Secretariat is situated on a pedestrian street in the old town part of the city at 50 rue le Royer West. \n\nThe Secretariat office is where all the staff of the Council is based.

Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, \"but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991</ref>\n\nIcograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.\n\nAt the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 }}</ref> In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}</ref> by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that \"the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week.\"\n\nThe first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.\n\nIn 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.\n\nIn 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.\n\nIn 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from D\u00fcsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.\n\nIn 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.\n\nThe 1977 Zurich Congress \u2212 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' \u2212 was complemented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne \u2212 'A Town and its Image' \u2212 and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.\n\nIn 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar \u2212 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.

The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''.

A multidisciplinary design competition on the theme of ''Shu/Collectivity'', held under the auspices of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and sponsored by the Japan Design Foundation, was won by Charles Owen from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 1985, the 11th Icograda Congress ''The place and influence of graphic design in everyday life'' was organised by Philippe Gentil<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> in Nice, the first time that there were major presentations from India ('design without designers' by people whose needs were too urgent to await intervention by professionals) and Australia (from boomerang to bicentenary); from the design of books in China to street signs in Buenos Aires, and provocatively 'the backside of design' \u2013 what happens after the consultant has moved on to new, more rewarding problems.

So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, \"a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry\". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over.

[[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been \u201cthe most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years\u201d. Jeremy Myerson called it \"a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons\". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, \"Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is Yuri Soloviev's story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it \u2212 keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.<ref name=\"icograda\" />\n\nFrom 23\u201327 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto.

The theme was ''Oullim'', meaning 'great harmony'. The event was attended by around 1,600 delegates and was also the first Icograda event to be webcast live on the Internet. The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.\n\nIn 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15\u201316 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.\n\nIn March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting. Smaller versions of the ''Design Perspectives'' seminar were also hosted in Victoria, Canada, as well as in Seattle, USA.

The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.\n\nIn September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.\n\nThe year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.\n\nIn January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members\u2019 interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.\n\nThe ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8\u201311 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003\u22122005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.\n\nIn January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey. The Week's programme included ''6 Alfabe, Icograda Student Workshop'', an IEN Symposium, Regional Meeting, ''Building Bridges: Icograda Design Conference'', ''Design Perspectives Icograda Regional Design Seminar'', as well as the launch of the Icograda Design Media Network (IDMN).

The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations\u2019 Secretariates to Montreal.\n\nIn January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport \u2013 Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.\n\n''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.\n\nIn 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks.

The Bronx was originally part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], but it was ceded to [[Manhattan|New York County]] in two major parts ([[West Bronx]], 1874 and [[East Bronx]], 1895) before it became Bronx County. Originally, the area was part of the [[Lenape]]'s [[Lenapehoking]] territory inhabited by [[Siwanoy]] of the [[Wappinger]] Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.\n\n===Before 1914===\n{{See also|List of former municipalities in New York City}}\nThe development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between [[New England]] and New York ([[Manhattan]]). Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents.

The apartments deteriorated and common areas deteriorated because the landlords had no cash-flow. And no cash flow meant that they could not get mortgages for major repairs such as boilers, roofs and window replacement.}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, parts of the Bronx were plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title=Arson for Hate and Profit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 31, 1977 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref> The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 2004\">Gonzalez (2004)</ref>\n\nOut of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate.

Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.\n\nMost east\u2013west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ \"Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps\"], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012.

It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1920|1920]], but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]] (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W.

Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. [[Harry Truman]], the winning Democrat, and 17% for [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressives]]. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate [[Allan Benson]]'s 7.3%.)<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 & 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)]; ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T.

The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P.

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], who began play in 2015.\n\n===Off-Off-Broadway===\n{{Main|Off-Off-Broadway}}\nThe Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.\n\n===Arts===\nThe [[Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance]], founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]] and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality.

Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].\n\nThe Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the \"[[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial\", better known as the [[Lorelei Fountain]]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797\u20131856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street.

The sound can be heard, for example, on the [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers recording of \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the [[Der Fuehrer's Face|same name]]), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: \"We'll Heil!

The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that \"The Bronx is burning\": in 1974 it was the title of both a ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |url=https://archive.org/details/ladiesgentlemenb00mahl |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=0-312-42430-2}}</ref> A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115184832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2009|title=Bronx Burning (2008)|date=January 15, 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}</ref> is in production<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |title=Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations |publisher=Bronx Council on the Arts |work=E-News Update |date=January 2006 |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626082500/http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |archive-date=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.\n\nBronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.''

A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events.

In 1846, a new town was created by division of Westchester, called West Farms. The town of [[Morrisania, Bronx|Morrisania]] was created, in turn, from West Farms in 1855.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}</ref> Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies\u2014a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a \"[[planned shrinkage]]\" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.<ref>Roderick Wallace: \"A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.\" ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1\u201333, and \"Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx\", ''Social Science & Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801\u2013813\u2014abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PubMed].

The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx.

Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.\n\nThree major north\u2013south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Other major north\u2013south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.\n\nMost east\u2013west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ \"Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps\"], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012.

It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1920|1920]], but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]] (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).\n\nSince then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2\u20131 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2\u20131 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. [[Harry Truman]], the winning Democrat, and 17% for [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressives]]. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate [[Allan Benson]]'s 7.3%.)<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 & 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)]; ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T.

The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.<ref>To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the boroughs voted]]</ref>\n\n{|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#d5d5d5;\"| {{center|'''The Bronx County vote for President and Mayor since 1952'''}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ff7;\"|'''President and Vice President of the United States'''|| style=\"background:#ffd588;\" colspan=\"3\"|'''Mayor of the City of New York'''\n|- style=\"background:#ff7;\"\n!

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], who began play in 2015.\n\n===Off-Off-Broadway===\n{{Main|Off-Off-Broadway}}\nThe Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.\n\n===Arts===\nThe [[Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance]], founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]] and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the [[American Bank Note Company Building]] before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|website=BAAD!

Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].\n\nThe Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the \"[[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial\", better known as the [[Lorelei Fountain]]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797\u20131856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.<ref name=\"GrayNYT2007\">Christopher Gray, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/realestate/27scap.html \"Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2007, retrieved on July 3, 2008.

Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |url=https://archive.org/details/ladiesgentlemenb00mahl |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=0-312-42430-2}}</ref> A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115184832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2009|title=Bronx Burning (2008)|date=January 15, 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}</ref> is in production<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |title=Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations |publisher=Bronx Council on the Arts |work=E-News Update |date=January 2006 |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626082500/http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |archive-date=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.\n\nBronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.''

Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n\nBy contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events.

The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, \"Bronx\", which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.

The king's favourite son, he was the founder of the semi-royal [[House of Bourbon-Maine]] named after his title and his surname.\n\n==Biography==\nLouis-Auguste de Bourbon was born at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] on 31 March 1670.\nHe was named ''Louis'' after his father<ref name=autogenerated1>''Ath\u00e9na\u00efs:The Real Queen of France'' by Lisa Hilton, p.153</ref> and ''Auguste'' after the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]]<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nImmediately after his birth, Louis-Auguste was placed in the care of one of his mother's acquaintances, the widowed [[Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, marquise de Maintenon|Madame Scarron]], who took him to live in a house on rue de Vaugirard, near the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. His siblings, [[Louis C\u00e9sar, Count of Vexin|Louis-C\u00e9sar]], [[Louise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon|Louise-Fran\u00e7oise]] and [[Louise Marie Anne de Bourbon]] were also brought there after their births.  Their mother, living with the king at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], rarely saw her children, and Madame Scarron took the place of mother in Louis-Auguste's affections.\n\nOne of his legs was shorter than the other and Scarron took him to consult, first, a famous [[Quackery|quack]] at Antwerp and later to the waters of Bareges, a small town near the [[Pyrenees]], whither they traveled incognito (she as the marquise de Surgeres).\n\nOn 19 December 1673, when Louis-Auguste was three years old, Louis XIV legitimised his children by Montespan by [[letters patent]] registered by the [[Parlement de Paris]].  At this time, Louis-Auguste received the title of ''duc du Maine''.\n\nIn 1674, at the age of four, Louis-Auguste and his siblings were officially introduced to the court at Versailles. In the same year, he was made a [[Swiss Guard|colonel-general of the Swiss Guards]].\n\nDu Maine's greatest enemy at court became his father's sister-in-law, the [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]], known at court as ''Madame''. In her famous correspondence describing life at Versailles, ''Madame'' claimed that du Maine was not the son of the king:\n\n<blockquote>\n''I can readily believe that the comte de Toulouse is the King's son; but I have always thought that the duc du Maine is the son of Terme [a member of the court], who was a false knave, and the greatest tale-bearer in the Court''<ref>Memoirs of the duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLouis XIV showered him with gifts and titles, and hired the best tutors for him. The [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|mar\u00e9chal du Luxembourg]], a famous military strategist, was put in charge of the child's military training. Despite this, Louis-Auguste never became more than a mediocre soldier. He was made ''[[Grand Ma\u00eetre de France]]''.\n\nThe king also blackmailed his cousin, the wealthy [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|''La Grande Mademoiselle'']], into ceding some of her estates to du Maine in return for the liberation of her imprisoned lover, [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont, Duke of Lauzun]]. As a result, Louis-Auguste became the ''[[Count of Eu|comte d'Eu]]'', [[Dombes#Political history|sovereign Prince of the Dombes]],  and ''[[Duke of Aumale|duc d'Aumale]]''.  He also received the governorship of [[Languedoc]] and was awarded the ''[[Order of the Holy Spirit]]''. In April 1684 du Maine represented the king at the wedding of the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]] to du Maine's cousin, [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]]. \nIn 1688, Louis Auguste was made a ''capitaine g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des gal\u00e8res'' (General of [[Galley]]s).\n\n==Marriage==\nSeveral potential brides were considered for him, including his first cousin, [[\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte d'Orl\u00e9ans]], the only daughter of his uncle, ''[[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Monsieur]]'' and his enemy, ''Madame'', who was horrified at the prospect of her daughter marrying a ''bastard''. However, the ''[[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1621\u20131686)|Grand Cond\u00e9]]'', a more distant relative of the king but still France's ''[[prince du Sang|premier prince du sang]]'', was willing to overlook the discrepancy in social status. So du Maine was allowed to choose among the three unmarried daughters of Cond\u00e9's son, the [[Henri Jules, Prince of Cond\u00e9|duc d'Enghien]]. He chose [[Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon|Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, ''Mademoiselle de Charolais'']], over her sisters, [[Anne Marie Victoire de Bourbon|Anne Marie, ''Mademoiselle de Cond\u00e9'']] and [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1678\u20131718)|Marie Anne, ''Mademoiselle de Montmorency'']] (later [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me|duchesse de Vend\u00f4me]]). Mademoiselle de Cond\u00e9 was quite upset, as she had her heart set on marrying du Maine:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Monsieur le Prince had three daughters for him [du Maine] to choose from, and an extra quarter of an inch of stature made him prefer the second. All three were extremely small; the eldest [Anne Marie] was beautiful, and full of sense and wit. The incredible constraint, to say the least of it, in which the strange temper of ''Monsieur le Prince'' kept everyone who was subject to his yoke, made the choice of her sister a cause of bitter heartburning to her''<ref>^ Lewis. L, W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the duc du Maine 1670\u20131736, New York, 1953, p.120</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 19 May 1692, Louis-Auguste and Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte were married in a ceremony at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Presided over by the [[Cardinal de Bouillon]], the guest of honour was the exiled [[James II of England]]. Madame de Montespan, who had fallen out of favour with the king after the [[Poison Affair|''Affaire des Poisons'']], did not attend her son's wedding. The duc du Maine received a gift of one million ''[[livres]]'' from his father at his wedding. His bride was given a hundred thousand livres in cash, with clothes and jewels worth an additional two hundred thousand ''livres''.\n\nThe marriage proved unhappy. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte felt disgraced by her marriage to a ''l\u00e9gitim\u00e9 de France'' and was often unfaithful. As the groom and bride were both physically handicapped (Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had a bad right arm and Louis had a lame leg), people at court snickered:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Voici l'union d'un boiteux et d'une manchote. Ah, le beau couple!''<ref>Lewis. L, W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the duc du Maine 1670\u20131736, New York, 1953, p.140</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, the couple eventually had three children who grew to adulthood. Their daughter, baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714, was known as ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' and named [[Louise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon]].\n\nIn 1707, Madame de Montespan died, and the duc du Maine inherited a large portion of her fortune, including the [[ch\u00e2teau de Clagny]], built for her by his father near the ch\u00e2teau at Versailles. Unlike his younger siblings, the duke did not express any emotion or remorse at the loss of his mother, as he considered Madame de Maintenon to have been more of a mother to him throughout his youth.\n\n==''Prince du Sang''==\nIn July 1714, pressed by Maintenon, Louis XIV raised Louis-Auguste and his younger brother, the [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse|comte de Toulouse]], to the rank of ''[[Prince du Sang|princes du sang]]'', and compelled the ''Parlement of Paris'' to acquiesce to their being placed in the [[order of succession|line of succession]] to the French throne, following all of the legitimate lines of the [[House of Bourbon]].\n\nIn August 1715, Louis XIV's health deteriorated drastically. On 22 August, he was unable to attend a troop parade in the gardens of Versailles, and he ordered the duc du Maine to take his place at this event. This public display of the Maine's \"promotion\" greatly concerned his rival, the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans.\n\n==Cellamare Conspiracy==\nOn 1 September 1715, Louis XIV died, and was to be succeeded by his great-grandson Louis, Duke of Anjou as [[Louis XV]]. The little boy was the grandson of Du Maine's late half-brother [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]]. The old king's last will and testament gave the regency to both his nephew the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans and the 45 year old duc du Maine. However, the next day, the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans ensured the annulment of Louis XIV's will in the [[Parlement de Paris]].\n\nDispleased with Orl\u00e9ans' actions, Louis-Auguste, pressured by his ambitious wife, joined in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] in the hope of transferring the regency to the young King [[Philip V of Spain]], who was the uncle of the boy king Louis XV and a half nephew of du Maine. The plot was named after [[Antonio del Giudice]], Prince di Cellamare, the Spanish ambassador to the French court. After the conspiracy was discovered, du Maine was arrested and imprisoned in the fortress of [[Doullens]], and his wife was exiled to [[Dijon]].\n\nIn 1720, the couple was pardoned by the Council of the Regent and was allowed to return to court. After their release from imprisonment in 1720, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte made an effort to reconcile with her husband, whom she had talked into joining the plot. She remarked:\n\n<blockquote>\n''I owe a full and rightful explanation to M. le Duc du Maine which is more precious to me than my own liberty or life''<ref>Je dois une justification authentique \u00e0 M. le Duc du Maine, qui me tient infiniment plus \u00e0 c\u0153ur que ma libert\u00e9 et que ma propre vie.  (Prince de Cond\u00e9 site){{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter the release, Louis-Auguste and his wife led a more subdued, compatible life at the [[ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux]], bought by Louis XIV for du Maine, where his wife created a little court attended by popular literary figures of the day. They also had a new home in Paris. On 27 December 1718, before their exile, he and his wife had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from his wife's sister, [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]]. It was originally designed by the architect [[Robert de Cotte]], but they had hired a new architect, [[Armand-Claude Mollet]], to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the [[H\u00f4tel du Maine]] (destroyed 1838).<ref>Robert Neuman (1994) ''Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France'', Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|9780226574370}}, pp. 142\u2013143; Alexandre Gady (2008) ''Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque'', Paris: Parigramme, {{ISBN|9782840962137}}, pp. 313. The site of the former H\u00f4tel du Maine is at 84\u201386 rue de Lille. This ''h\u00f4tel'' is not to be confused with his wife's later residence, also called the H\u00f4tel du Maine (now the [[H\u00f4tel Biron]]), on the rue de Varenne.</ref>\n\nLouise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte on several occasions tried to marry off their children. First, she tried to marry their son and main heir, [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|Louis Auguste de Bourbon]], to his first cousin [[Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans|Charlotte Agla\u00e9, ''Mademoiselle de Valois'']], daughter of du Maine's younger sister, [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon]]. The young ''Mademoiselle de Valois'' refused, however.\n\nLater, Louise-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte tried to marry off ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' twice. First, she offered her daughter's hand to the duc de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. She then offered the girl to the widower, [[Jacques I, Prince of Monaco]], who was often at Versailles. Despite offering a large dowry to both men, neither accepted. ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' eventually died in 1743, alone and single, at the age thirty-five. She was buried at the \u00c9glise at Sceaux.\n\nIt was at Sceaux that du Maine died on 14 May 1736 at the age of sixty-six, during the reign of his grandnephew Louis XV, by now a young man of twenty-six years. The [[House of Bourbon-Maine]] became extinct at the death of his eldest son, the [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|prince de Dombes]], in 1775.\n\nThe large du Maine fortune was inherited by their cousin, the [[Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre|duc de Penthi\u00e8vre]], the only son of du Maine's younger brother, [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse]].\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n*31 March 1670 \u2013 19 December 1673: Louis Auguste de Bourbon\n*19 December 1673 \u2013 July 1714: ''[[Highness|His Highness]]'',<ref>ib.

The king's favourite son, he was the founder of the semi-royal [[House of Bourbon-Maine]] named after his title and his surname.\n\n==Biography==\nLouis-Auguste de Bourbon was born at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] on 31 March 1670.\nHe was named ''Louis'' after his father<ref name=autogenerated1>''Ath\u00e9na\u00efs:The Real Queen of France'' by Lisa Hilton, p.153</ref> and ''Auguste'' after the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]]<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nImmediately after his birth, Louis-Auguste was placed in the care of one of his mother's acquaintances, the widowed [[Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, marquise de Maintenon|Madame Scarron]], who took him to live in a house on rue de Vaugirard, near the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. His siblings, [[Louis C\u00e9sar, Count of Vexin|Louis-C\u00e9sar]], [[Louise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon|Louise-Fran\u00e7oise]] and [[Louise Marie Anne de Bourbon]] were also brought there after their births.  Their mother, living with the king at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], rarely saw her children, and Madame Scarron took the place of mother in Louis-Auguste's affections.\n\nOne of his legs was shorter than the other and Scarron took him to consult, first, a famous [[Quackery|quack]] at Antwerp and later to the waters of Bareges, a small town near the [[Pyrenees]], whither they traveled incognito (she as the marquise de Surgeres).\n\nOn 19 December 1673, when Louis-Auguste was three years old, Louis XIV legitimised his children by Montespan by [[letters patent]] registered by the [[Parlement de Paris]].  At this time, Louis-Auguste received the title of ''duc du Maine''.\n\nIn 1674, at the age of four, Louis-Auguste and his siblings were officially introduced to the court at Versailles. In the same year, he was made a [[Swiss Guard|colonel-general of the Swiss Guards]].\n\nDu Maine's greatest enemy at court became his father's sister-in-law, the [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]], known at court as ''Madame''. In her famous correspondence describing life at Versailles, ''Madame'' claimed that du Maine was not the son of the king:\n\n<blockquote>\n''I can readily believe that the comte de Toulouse is the King's son; but I have always thought that the duc du Maine is the son of Terme [a member of the court], who was a false knave, and the greatest tale-bearer in the Court''<ref>Memoirs of the duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLouis XIV showered him with gifts and titles, and hired the best tutors for him. The [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|mar\u00e9chal du Luxembourg]], a famous military strategist, was put in charge of the child's military training. Despite this, Louis-Auguste never became more than a mediocre soldier. He was made ''[[Grand Ma\u00eetre de France]]''.\n\nThe king also blackmailed his cousin, the wealthy [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|''La Grande Mademoiselle'']], into ceding some of her estates to du Maine in return for the liberation of her imprisoned lover, [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont, Duke of Lauzun]]. As a result, Louis-Auguste became the ''[[Count of Eu|comte d'Eu]]'', [[Dombes#Political history|sovereign Prince of the Dombes]],  and ''[[Duke of Aumale|duc d'Aumale]]''.  He also received the governorship of [[Languedoc]] and was awarded the ''[[Order of the Holy Spirit]]''. In April 1684 du Maine represented the king at the wedding of the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]] to du Maine's cousin, [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]]. \nIn 1688, Louis Auguste was made a ''capitaine g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des gal\u00e8res'' (General of [[Galley]]s).\n\n==Marriage==\nSeveral potential brides were considered for him, including his first cousin, [[\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte d'Orl\u00e9ans]], the only daughter of his uncle, ''[[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Monsieur]]'' and his enemy, ''Madame'', who was horrified at the prospect of her daughter marrying a ''bastard''. However, the ''[[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1621\u20131686)|Grand Cond\u00e9]]'', a more distant relative of the king but still France's ''[[prince du Sang|premier prince du sang]]'', was willing to overlook the discrepancy in social status. So du Maine was allowed to choose among the three unmarried daughters of Cond\u00e9's son, the [[Henri Jules, Prince of Cond\u00e9|duc d'Enghien]]. He chose [[Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon|Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, ''Mademoiselle de Charolais'']], over her sisters, [[Anne Marie Victoire de Bourbon|Anne Marie, ''Mademoiselle de Cond\u00e9'']] and [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1678\u20131718)|Marie Anne, ''Mademoiselle de Montmorency'']] (later [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me|duchesse de Vend\u00f4me]]). Mademoiselle de Cond\u00e9 was quite upset, as she had her heart set on marrying du Maine:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Monsieur le Prince had three daughters for him [du Maine] to choose from, and an extra quarter of an inch of stature made him prefer the second. All three were extremely small; the eldest [Anne Marie] was beautiful, and full of sense and wit. The incredible constraint, to say the least of it, in which the strange temper of ''Monsieur le Prince'' kept everyone who was subject to his yoke, made the choice of her sister a cause of bitter heartburning to her''<ref>^ Lewis. L, W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the duc du Maine 1670-1736, New York, 1953, p.120</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 19 May 1692, Louis-Auguste and Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte were married in a ceremony at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Presided over by the [[Cardinal de Bouillon]], the guest of honour was the exiled [[James II of England]]. Madame de Montespan, who had fallen out of favour with the king after the [[Poison Affair|''Affaire des Poisons'']], did not attend her son's wedding. The duc du Maine received a gift of one million ''[[livres]]'' from his father at his wedding. His bride was given a hundred thousand livres in cash, with clothes and jewels worth an additional two hundred thousand ''livres''.\n\nThe marriage proved unhappy. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte felt disgraced by her marriage to a ''l\u00e9gitim\u00e9 de France'' and was often unfaithful. As the groom and bride were both physically handicapped (Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had a bad right arm and Louis had a lame leg), people at court snickered:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Voici l'union d'un boiteux et d'une manchote. Ah, le beau couple!''<ref>Lewis. L, W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the duc du Maine 1670-1736, New York, 1953, p.140</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, the couple eventually had three children who grew to adulthood. Their daughter, baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714, was known as ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' and named [[Louise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon]].\n\nIn 1707, Madame de Montespan died, and the duc du Maine inherited a large portion of her fortune, including the [[ch\u00e2teau de Clagny]], built for her by his father near the ch\u00e2teau at Versailles. Unlike his younger siblings, the duke did not express any emotion or remorse at the loss of his mother, as he considered Madame de Maintenon to have been more of a mother to him throughout his youth.\n\n==''Prince du Sang''==\nIn July 1714, pressed by Maintenon, Louis XIV raised Louis-Auguste and his younger brother, the [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse|comte de Toulouse]], to the rank of ''[[Prince du Sang|princes du sang]]'', and compelled the ''Parlement of Paris'' to acquiesce to their being placed in the [[order of succession|line of succession]] to the French throne, following all of the legitimate lines of the [[House of Bourbon]].\n\nIn August 1715, Louis XIV's health deteriorated drastically. On 22 August, he was unable to attend a troop parade in the gardens of Versailles, and he ordered the duc du Maine to take his place at this event. This public display of the Maine's \"promotion\" greatly concerned his rival, the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans.\n\n==Cellamare Conspiracy==\nOn 1 September 1715, Louis XIV died, and was to be succeeded by his great-grandson Louis, Duke of Anjou as [[Louis XV]]. The little boy was the grandson of Du Maine's late half-brother [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]]. The old king's last will and testament gave the regency to both his nephew the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans and the 45 year old duc du Maine. However, the next day, the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans ensured the annulment of Louis XIV's will in the [[Parlement de Paris]].\n\nDispleased with Orl\u00e9ans' actions, Louis-Auguste, pressured by his ambitious wife, joined in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] in the hope of transferring the regency to the young King [[Philip V of Spain]], who was the uncle of the boy king Louis XV and a half nephew of du Maine. The plot was named after [[Antonio del Giudice]], Prince di Cellamare, the Spanish ambassador to the French court. After the conspiracy was discovered, du Maine was arrested and imprisoned in the fortress of [[Doullens]], and his wife was exiled to [[Dijon]].\n\nIn 1720, the couple was pardoned by the Council of the Regent and was allowed to return to court. After their release from imprisonment in 1720, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte made an effort to reconcile with her husband, whom she had talked into joining the plot. She remarked:\n\n<blockquote>\n''I owe a full and rightful explanation to M. le Duc du Maine which is more precious to me than my own liberty or life''<ref>Je dois une justification authentique \u00e0 M. le Duc du Maine, qui me tient infiniment plus \u00e0 c\u0153ur que ma libert\u00e9 et que ma propre vie.  (Prince de Cond\u00e9 site){{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter the release, Louis-Auguste and his wife led a more subdued, compatible life at the [[ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux]], bought by Louis XIV for du Maine, where his wife created a little court attended by popular literary figures of the day. They also had a new home in Paris. On 27 December 1718, before their exile, he and his wife had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from his wife's sister, [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]]. It was originally designed by the architect [[Robert de Cotte]], but they had hired a new architect, [[Armand-Claude Mollet]], to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the [[H\u00f4tel du Maine]] (destroyed 1838).<ref>Robert Neuman (1994) ''Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France'', Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|9780226574370}}, pp. 142\u2013143; Alexandre Gady (2008) ''Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque'', Paris: Parigramme, {{ISBN|9782840962137}}, pp. 313. The site of the former H\u00f4tel du Maine is at 84\u201386 rue de Lille. This ''h\u00f4tel'' is not to be confused with his wife's later residence, also called the H\u00f4tel du Maine (now the [[H\u00f4tel Biron]]), on the rue de Varenne.</ref>\n\nLouise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte on several occasions tried to marry off their children. First, she tried to marry their son and main heir, [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|Louis Auguste de Bourbon]], to his first cousin [[Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans|Charlotte Agla\u00e9, ''Mademoiselle de Valois'']], daughter of du Maine's younger sister, [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon]]. The young ''Mademoiselle de Valois'' refused, however.\n\nLater, Louise-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte tried to marry off ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' twice. First, she offered her daughter's hand to the duc de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. She then offered the girl to the widower, [[Jacques I, Prince of Monaco]], who was often at Versailles. Despite offering a large dowry to both men, neither accepted. ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' eventually died in 1743, alone and single, at the age thirty-five. She was buried at the \u00c9glise at Sceaux.\n\nIt was at Sceaux that du Maine died on 14 May 1736 at the age of sixty-six, during the reign of his grandnephew Louis XV, by now a young man of twenty-six years. The [[House of Bourbon-Maine]] became extinct at the death of his eldest son, the [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|prince de Dombes]], in 1775.\n\nThe large du Maine fortune was inherited by their cousin, the [[Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre|duc de Penthi\u00e8vre]], the only son of du Maine's younger brother, [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse]].\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n*31 March 1670 \u2013 19 December 1673: Louis Auguste de Bourbon\n*19 December 1673 \u2013 July 1714: ''[[Highness|His Highness]]'',<ref>ib.

The name developed from a hoped-for sponsorship from the [[Mitchells & Butlers Brewery]] which failed to materialise, the band calling themselves both \"The M Bs\" and \"The M B Five\", and was also a subtle reference to the [[Duke Ellington]] song \"Mood Indigo\".<ref name=\"CLAS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/MikePinderInterview.html|title=Interview With Mike Pinder|publisher=Classicbands.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826093257/http://www.classicbands.com/MikePinderInterview.html|archivedate=26 August 2015}}</ref> In an interview it was revealed that the band was named \"Moody Blues\" because Mike Pinder was interested in how music changes people's moods and due to the fact that the band was playing blues at the time.<ref name=\"CLAS\" /> Around this time the band were the resident group at the Carlton Ballroom, later to become rock music venue [[Mothers (music venue)|Mothers]] on Erdington High Street.\n\nThe band soon obtained a London-based management company, 'Ridgepride', formed by Alex Murray ([[Alex Wharton]]), who had been in the [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] division of [[Decca Records]].  Their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with Ridgepride, which then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", that year which failed to chart. They also appeared on the cult TV programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' singing the uptempo 'B' side \"Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose your Mind)\". But it was their second single, \"[[Go Now]]\" (released later that year), that launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by [[Alex Wharton]]. The single became a hit in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (where it remains their only Number 1 single)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|title=Moody Blues - British Invasion Bands|work=britishinvasionbands.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824084822/http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|archivedate=24 August 2010}}</ref> and in the United States, where it reached No. 10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) directly as recording artists. A four-track [[extended play]] release titled \"The Moody Blues\" featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965.\n\nTheir debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]'', produced by [[Denny Cordell]] with a strong [[Beat music|Merseybeat]]/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] flavour, was released on Decca in mono only in 1965. It contained the hit single together with one side of classic R&B covers, and a second side with four Laine-Pinder originals.\n\nAlex Wharton left the management firm, and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles. They enjoyed a minor British hit with a cover of \"I Don't Want To Go on Without You\" (No. 33) in February 1965, while the Pinder-Laine original \"From the Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)\" produced by Denny Cordell (with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their sound on \"Nights in White Satin\") was issued as a UK single in May 1965 and did a little better (No. 22). But then \"Everyday\", another Pinder-Laine song, stalled at No. 44 in October 1965 and no further British singles were released for about a year. The group was still in demand for live gigs, though, and they had chart success in the US and in Europe during those months when \"Bye Bye Bird\" (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from their album in December 1965 as an overseas single in France (No. 3).\n\nIn June 1966, Warwick retired from the group and the music business. He was briefly replaced by Rod Clark (born Rodney Clark, 23 November 1942, [[Surlingham]], near [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]]), but in early October, Denny Laine also departed from the group,<ref>\"Denny left on Saturday and we\u00b4re not sure what we\u00b4re going to do. We\u00b4re waiting to see [[Brian Epstein]] to talk things over with him.\" Ray Thomas, as quoted by ''Record Mirror'', 8 October 1966: {{cite web |url=http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716143526/http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |archivedate=16 July 2014  }}. Epstein, however, dropped the band almost immediately (same website)</ref> which made Decca release \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" c/w \"This is My House (But Nobody Calls)\" (Decca F 12498, 1966) only a few days later, as the Moody Blues seemed to be disintegrating. Clark joined [[The Rockin' Berries]].\n\nIn the November 1966 issue of ''Hit Week'', Dutch interviewers Hans van Rij and Emie Havers presented their story, saying the Moody Blues had been in the process of recording their second album, ''Look Out'',<ref>see article {{cite web |url=http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217133235/http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |archivedate=17 December 2014  }} on Tony Brown\u00b4s website, taken from ''Hit Week #10'', November 1966, page 5.</ref> with Cordell producing. The album was not to be and \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (released as a single c/w \"Fly Me High\" some months later) is the only song mentioned in the article but the authors say Laine had written all of the material, with Thomas, Pinder and Clark (still the bass player) singing lead vocals as well.\n\nA final 'Mark One' Moodies single, Pinder-Laine's \"Life's Not Life\", was scheduled for release in January 1967 (Decca F 12543) c/w \"He Can Win\" even though Laine<ref>\"I wasn't content to just carry on this gig just to bring money in. Our management thing had all fallen apart. We'd gone with Epstein and that was a disaster.\" Laine interviewed by Mark Murley in ''Higher & Higher # 36, 1997, page 18.</ref> couldn't perform it live because the group had relaunched themselves without him a few months earlier. (This single's release is often listed as being cancelled; however, both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years.)\n\n===Arrival of Hayward and Lodge===\nThe group re-formed in November 1966. By then, \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" had made the Belgian charts and won them more fans, which came in handy when they relocated to Belgium for some time. The new members were [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], their bassist from El Riot who was now finished with his education, and [[Justin Hayward]], formerly of the Wilde Three. Hayward was recommended to Pinder by [[Eric Burdon]] of [[the Animals]] and was endorsed by famed UK singer [[Marty Wilde]], the leader of the Wilde Three. Pinder phoned Hayward after reading his lead guitarist letter, and was impressed when Hayward played him his 45 rpm single \"London is Behind Me\" during their car ride to meet the other members in [[Esher]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAfter financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member, the band soon realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]\", and \"[[Bye Bye Bird]]\", with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer [[Tony Clarke (record producer)|Tony Clarke]], who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's [[mellotron]], was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of [[everyman]].\n\n==Deram Records, Threshold Records, 1967\u20131972==\n\n===''Days of Future Passed''===\n[[File:Moody Blues, Bestanddeelnr 922-1824.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The Moody Blues in the Netherlands (1969)]]\nThe Moody Blues' contract with [[Decca Records]] was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances. The second album had never materialised either. They had the support, however, of Decca A&R manager [[Hugh Mendl]], who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of London/Decca's new subsidiary imprint [[Deram Records]]. With Mendl's backing, the Moody Blues were offered a deal to make a [[rock and roll]] version of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s ''[[Symphony No.&nbsp;9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|New World Symphony]]'' to promote the company's new Deramic Stereo Sound audio format<ref name=\"Eder 2009\">{{cite web |last = Eder |first = Bruce |title = The Moody Blues: Biography |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision] |year = 2009 |url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate = 28 July 2009}}</ref> in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt.\n\nThe Moody Blues agreed, but insisted that they be given artistic control of the project, and Mendl (as executive producer) was able to provide this despite Decca's notoriously tight-fisted attitude to their artists.<ref name=\"INDObit\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html Obituaries \u2013 Hugh Mendl: Producer at Decca Records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517190104/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html |date=17 May 2017 }}; ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 July 2008.</ref> The group was unable to complete the assigned project,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which was abandoned.

Five years later it reached number 3 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the US. The LP was a [[song cycle]] or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day.  The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by [[the Beatles]], to whom Pinder had introduced the mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the [[London Festival Orchestra]],<ref name=pc49>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming!

Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward's \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" (absent on the single) but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording, with the band's rock instrumentation centred on Pinder's mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, the LP was cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable \"linking\" orchestral portion, which the Decca musicians (\"London Festival Orchestra\") then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: \"Redwave-Knight\", although Hayward wrote \"Nights...\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\", Thomas provided \"Another Morning\" and \"Twilight Time\", Lodge penned \"Peak Hour\" and \"Evening (Time To Get Away)\", and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first \"Morning Glory\" and the latter titled \"Late Lament\") read by Mike Pinder who composed both \"The Sun Set\" and \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (sung by Hayward, with Pinder singing the bridge section).\n\nClarke produced the album, and afterwards continued working with the band. Sometimes known to fans as \"The Sixth Moodie\", he produced their albums and singles for the next eleven years. Engineer Derek Varnals also contributed heavily to the creation of the early Moody's studio sound, working with Pinder and Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the mellotron as opposed to the sharp 'cut off' the instrument normally gave, partly achieved by removing all the \"sound effects\" tapes (trains, whistles, cockerel crowing, etc.) and then 'doubling up' the tapes of orchestral instruments' sounds, which combined with Pinder's ability and sensitivity at playing (Pinder having earlier worked for the company that manufactured the mellotron) and Varnals' recording skills at creating an orchestral 'wave' sound that characterised their non-orchestra accompanied sound thereafter.\n\nThe album, plus two singles therefrom, \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" and \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\" (as a medley with \"Forever Afternoon,\" listed as \"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\" on the album), took time to find an audience. In the Moody Blues' native Britain, the two singles from the album didn't initially catch on; \"Nights in White Satin\" made only No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart|British singles chart]] in early 1968, and \"Tuesday Afternoon\" didn't chart at all. However, the British public learned to appreciate \"Nights in White Satin\" subsequently; it made No. 9 on the UK singles chart on re-issue in December 1972 and No. 14 on the charts on another reissue at the end of 1979, and is now regarded as the Moody Blues signature song by British audiences. In the US, \"Nights in White Satin\" did not make the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1968, although it reached No. 2 on re-release in 1972; \"Tuesday Afternoon\" was more successful on initial release stateside, peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n===''In Search of the Lost Chord''===\nThe 1968 follow-up LP, ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]'' included \"[[Legend of a Mind]]\", a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to [[LSD]] guru [[Timothy Leary]] which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas \u2013 four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at [[Groot-Bijgaarden Castle]] near [[Brussels]] in Belgium. Lodge provided a two-part song \"House of Four Doors\" set either side of Thomas' epic piece. [[Justin Hayward]] began playing [[sitar]] and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (\"Voices...\", \"Visions of Paradise\", \"Om\", etc.), having been inspired by [[George Harrison]]. Hayward's \"Voices in the Sky\" charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge's \"Ride My See-Saw\" (No. 42, No. 15 in France) \u2013 still their concert finale number \u2013 which featured Pinder's non-album song \"A Simple Game\" as the 'B' side. Pinder's \"The Best Way to Travel\" was another high point, as was his closing song \"Om\" (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that  followed. Edge narrated his brief \"Departure\" poem on \"Lost Chord\", although Pinder recited the majority of Edge's poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more [[whisky]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|title=Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge interviewed - TechnologyTell|work=TechnologyTell|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129021244/http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|archivedate=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''On the Threshold of a Dream''===\n\nOn 1969's ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'', Hayward, Edge and Pinder share the opening narration on Edge's \"In The Beginning\", leading into Hayward's \"Lovely To See You\". His \"Never Comes the Day\" was issued as a UK single, while Thomas' wry observations of life in \"Dear Diary\" and \"Lazy Day\" were striking features. Pinder contributed the closing track on side one, \"So Deep Within You\". Side two closed with the \"Dream Sequence\", Edge's poem \"The Dream\" leading into Pinder's \"Have You Heard?\" parts I and II with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece \"The Voyage\".\n\n===''To Our Children's Children's Children''===\nThe band's music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of [[reverberation]] on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969's ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]''&nbsp;\u2013 a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track \"Higher and Higher\" saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge's lyrics. Thomas' \"Floating\" and \"Eternity Road\" stood out, as did Hayward's \"Gypsy\" and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration \"Out and In\". Lodge provided his two-part \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Candle of Life\" while Pinder contributed \"Sun is Still Shining\". The album closed with \"[[Watching and Waiting]]\", composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label \"Threshold\" under licence to Decca Records. ''To Our Children's Children's Children'' was the first of their albums to be released on their own label. The song \"Watching and Waiting\" was issued as a single on the Threshold label, but failed to chart.\n\n===''A Question of Balance''===\n\nAlthough the Moodies had by now defined a somewhat [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] style and helped to define the [[progressive rock]] (then also known as 'art rock') sound, the group decided to record an album that could be played in concert, losing some of their full-blown sound for ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' (1970). This album, reaching No. 3 in the American charts and No. 1 in the British charts, was indicative of the band's growing success in America. Hayward's \"Question\" (in a different version) was issued as a single, reaching No. 2 in the UK (kept from the top spot only by the England World Cup football team's novelty record \"Back Home\"). Justin Hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous [[effects pedals]] and [[distortion (music)|fuzzboxes]] and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound. The Moody Blues had by now become a bill-topping act in their own right. They appeared twice at the famous [[Isle of Wight Festival]] (A DVD of their 1970 performance has been released). Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\" (a No.1 single in France) stood out beside Hayward's \"Question\" on the 1970 album.\n\n===''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' and ''Seventh Sojourn''===\nFor their next two albums, ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' (1971) \u2013 from which Hayward's \"[[The Story in Your Eyes]]\" was taken as a US charting single (No. 23) \u2013 and ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'' (1972) (which reached No. 1 in the US), the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which, while difficult to reproduce in concert, had become their trademark. The title \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a [[mnemonic]] used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track \"Procession\" was the only item composed by all five band members, a fascinating track depicting the \"evolution\" of music, leading into Hayward's \"Story in Your Eyes\". Thomas's reflective \"Our Guessing Game\" and whimsical \"Nice To Be Here\" offset the deeper drama of Hayward's \"You Can Never Go Home\", Lodge's \"One More Time To Live\" and Pinder's \"My Song\". Edge, the long-standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken \u2013 his \"After You Came\" (1971) featured each of the four lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972, Lodge's songs \"Isn't Life Strange?\" (No. 13) and \"[[I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)]]\" (No. 36) were lifted from ''Seventh Sojourn'' as charting UK singles. ''Sojourn'' also saw Pinder using the new [[Chamberlin]] instrument in place of the mellotron and Edge using an electronic drum kit. Pinder's stirring lament \"Lost in a Lost World\" opened this last \"Core Seven\" outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary \"When You're a Free Man\", Thomas's romantic \"For My Lady\", and Hayward's serene \"New Horizons\" all stood out.\n\nIn an interview following the release of ''Seventh Sojourn'', Graeme Edge told Rolling Stone: \"We've got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travellingeternityroad.yuku.com/topic/6649/Threshold-Records-The-Shop?page=2#.VLxJvigrxT5 |title=Threshold Records (The Shop) in Moody Blues Hall Forum |publisher=Travellingeternityroad.yuku.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder's songs \"A Simple Game\" (1968) and \"So Deep Within You\" (1969) were successfully covered by [[the Four Tops]], Pinder winning an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for \"A Simple Game\", [[Elkie Brooks]] later covered Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\". Pinder also appeared on [[John Lennon]]'s \"Imagine\" album in 1971, providing additional percussion on \"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don't Want to Die)\". The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas's \"Hopes, Wishes & Dreams\" in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers.\n\nIn late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old \"Nights in White Satin\" became the Moody Blues' biggest US hit, soaring to number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had \"bubbled under\" the Hot 100 charts on its original release. The song also returned to the UK charts, reaching No. 9, ten places higher than its original release in 1967.\n\n===Threshold Records===\nThe Moodies were also among the pioneers of the idea that a successful rock band could promote itself through their own label, following the Beatles' creation of [[Apple Records]]. After their ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'' album (1969), they created ''[[Threshold Records]]'', prompted in part by disputes with London/Deram over album design costs (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). The idea was for Threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to London/Decca who would act as distributor. The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent&nbsp;\u2013 most notably the UK [[hard rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] and the [[Portland, Oregon]], classical-acoustic sextet [[Providence (band)|Providence]]&nbsp;\u2013 but these efforts were unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts. However, they helped lay groundwork for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals, including [[the Rolling Stones]]' own label and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]],{{citation needed|reason=according to whom? Very different reasons for this have been stated by members of both groups, none of which reflected the MB's|date=April 2015}} and all of the Moodies' studio releases from 1969 to 1999 bore the [[Threshold Records|Threshold]] logo on at least one of their format versions.\n\n==A break and solo work, 1974\u20131977==\nIn the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of [[Asia]], the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of ''Higher & Higher'' magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] (as the \"[[Caught Live + 5]]\" album displayed. Caught Live + 5 was a live double album recorded c. 1969 but released c. 1977 with five previously unreleased studio tracks from 1967-69 added.)\n\nBefore the band's 1973\u201374 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \"Island\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album ''[[This Is The Moody Blues]]'' which was released that year.\n\nHayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'' (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with [[10cc]] backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album ''The Promise.\"''<ref>[http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130649/http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml|date=20 June 2007}}</ref> Edge produced two albums with guitarist [[Adrian Gurvitz]] and his brother Paul Gurvitz, ''Kick Off Your Muddy Boots'' (1975) and ''Paradise Ballroom'' (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]'' (1977), which was followed up a few years later by ''[[Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)|Night Flight]]'' (1980), ''[[Moving Mountains (Justin Hayward album)|Moving Mountains]]'' (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) ''[[Classic Blue]]'' (1989), ''[[The View from the Hill (album)|The View From The Hill]]'' (1996) and ''[[Live in San Juan Capistrano (album)|Live in San Juan Capistrano]]'' (1998); Lodge released ''[[Natural Avenue (album)|Natural Avenue]]'' (1977); Pinder produced ''[[The Promise (Mike Pinder album)|The Promise]]'' (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing ''[[From Mighty Oaks (album)|From Mighty Oaks]]'' (1975) and ''[[Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (album)|Hopes, Wishes and Dreams]]'' (1976).\n\n==Reunion, 1977\u20131990==\n\n===Reunion===\n[[File:Moody Blues.jpg|thumb|1978\u201390 line-up. L-R: [[Patrick Moraz]], [[Ray Thomas]], [[Graeme Edge]], [[Justin Hayward]] and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]]]]\nIn 1977, the group made a decision to record together again, with their record company Decca urging a reunion album. [[London Records]] decided to release a somewhat poorly mixed eight-year-old recording of the band performing at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], against their artistic wishes. London/Decca did this in an attempt to re-energise public interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album, but by this time Pinder had remarried and started a family in [[California]], so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked with tension and division: first there was a fire at the studios they were using, then after quickly relocating to Pinder's home studio, a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them, inevitably causing tensions to rise (with Pinder then dropping out before completion).\n\nClarke was also forced to leave because of non-musical reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, and by then probably considering the band's touring days behind them, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. His decision caused acrimony within the band (notably from Edge) and Ray Thomas had said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring, but his opting out later on (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a severely embarrassing blow to them. Attempts were made by their management to downplay Pinder's absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a \"welcome back\" speech, openly referred to \"Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the [[United States|States]]\", much to their dismay.\n\n===''Octave'', Pinder departs and the arrival of Moraz, ''Long Distance Voyager'' and ''The Present''===\nDuring this period, the prog-rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] had asked their keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]], to leave, and he joined the Moody Blues as keyboardist for the Octave World Tour. The album sold well and produced the hits \"[[Steppin' in a Slide Zone]]\", (no. 39 US) and \"[[Driftwood (The Moody Blues song)|Driftwood]]\", (no. 59 US). On ''Octave'', Hayward had four solo compositions, whilst Edge contributed \"I'll Be Level With You\" (aka \"Little Man\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Moody Blues toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. A live CD ''The Moody Blues Live in Seattle 1979'' during the ''Octave'' tour of a concert at [[Key Arena|Seattle Center Coliseum]] recorded on 25 May 1979 was later issued in 2013. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer [[Pip Williams]]. Moraz was retained as the band's permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder took legal action to prevent the new Moody Blues album from reaching the public without his contributions, but he was not successful, and ultimately, he never returned to the fold. Nevertheless, when released in 1981, ''[[Long Distance Voyager]]'' was a colossal success, reaching No. 1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' and going Top 5 in the UK. The album yielded two hits, \"[[The Voice (The Moody Blues song)|The Voice]]\", (No. 15 US) written by Hayward, and \"[[Gemini Dream]]\", (No. 12 US) written by Hayward and Lodge. John Lodge's \"Talking out of Turn\" also charted in the US, reaching No. 65. Edge provided \"22,000 Days\" (featuring Thomas as lead voice with Hayward and Lodge) while Thomas' contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs; \"Painted Smile\", \"Reflective Smile\" (a poem narrated by a DJ friend of the band) and \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\". By now, the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound as Moraz gave a more contemporary edge{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In live concerts, the mellotron was still used heavily by Moraz until the mid-1980s, including on songs that did not originally feature it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |title=Stepping In A Slide Zone \u2013 LIVE |publisher=YouTube |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625014810/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |archivedate=25 June 2014  }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Present]]'' (1983), again produced by Williams, was less successful than its predecessor, though it spawned a UK Top 40 hit (No. 35) in \"[[Blue World (The Moody Blues song)|Blue World]]\" (No. 62 in the US) and a US Top 40 hit in \"[[Sitting at the Wheel]]\" (which failed to chart in the UK). Videos were also produced for both singles. ''The Present'' was released in conjunction with Talencora Ltd shortly before Decca was bought out by [[Polydor Records]].\n\n===''The Other Side of Life'', ''Sur la Mer''===\nIn 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album ''[[The Other Side of Life]]'' and in particular with the track \"[[Your Wildest Dreams]]\" \u2013 a US Top 10 hit (and No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks) which garnered a [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Video of the Year award after being frequently featured on [[MTV]]. Newly employed producer [[Tony Visconti]] and Barry Radman, a synth programmer formerly engaged by Moraz, delivered a modern sound the Moodies had been seeking in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries and the album's title song also charted in the US, at No. 58. The renewed interest in the band ensured a younger audience, with many of their longtime followers remaining loyal despite a fair number of older fans finding the albums of this period far more lightweight in content - for example, Lodge had gone from writing powerfully reflective mystical or humanitarian themed pieces such as \"House of Four Doors\", \"Candle of Life\" and \"One More Time to Live\" to quirkier items such as \"Here Comes the Weekend\", \"Rock and Roll Over You\" and \"Love is on the Run (From Me)\" while Hayward's songs seemed{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} less the deeper drama of numbers such as \"The Actor\", \"Dawning is the Day\", \"You Can Never Go Home\", \"The Land of Make Believe\", etc., to pleasant (and more radio-friendly) perennial far simpler songs about lost love and romance (\"Your Wildest Dreams\", \"No More Lies\", \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" etc.). There were still some deeper songs being created by the band, (\"The Voice\", \"22,000 Days\", \"The Other Side of Life\", \"The Spirit\", \"Deep\", etc.) but the overall tone had noticeably become a more lightweight commercialised one; presumably this was with record company agreement to keep in accordance with the then prevailing times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Their live shows from this period included a good number of their 1980s album tracks.  However, over time, more of the \"Core Seven\" album era favourites reappeared in their playlist, but Pinder's compositions were permanently retired from their setlists after his departure.\n\nThe Moody Blues performed live at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]] which raised money for [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]]. The band played four songs, and later provided backup with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] for [[George Harrison]].\n\nThe Moodies continued their early video-generation success with ''[[Sur La Mer]]'' (1988) and its video and single, \"[[I Know You're Out There Somewhere]]\" (No. 30 US, No. 52 UK, No. 2 US Mainstream Rock), a sequel to \"Your Wildest Dreams\". Their sound took on an ever-increasingly synthetic and technical quality as Moraz and Visconti began using modern sequencers, samplers and drum machines. Hayward and Lodge wrote and sang on most of the songs as the band came under pressure from their new record company, [[Polydor Records]], to promote those it deemed to be the two more commercial looking and sounding members and they decided to exploit that aspect rather than catering for the band as a whole or retaining the five-way songwriting methods the group had done with Pinder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |title=The Moody Blues: In Review \u2022 Sur La Mer (1988) |publisher=Runstop.de |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=26 August 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715175641/http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |archivedate=15 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\nBy then, Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio with the band evolving into a [[synthpop]] act, a genre that was unsuitable for the use of a flute. Thomas provided additional percussion, notably a brisk tambourine, on many more Moodies songs which continued to be featured, plus occasional harmonica, but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer and he was also unwell during this period, further limiting his involvement with the band in the recording studio.\n\nThomas provided some backing vocals for both ''The Other Side of Life'' and ''Sur La Mer''; however, for reasons unclear, multiple production considerations led Visconti to leave Thomas' vocals off the latter of these two albums, thereby further reducing the texture of their overall vocal sound, which had previously been rich four-part harmonies (Hayward, Lodge, Thomas and Pinder), then went down to three (Thomas, Lodge and Hayward) upon Pinder's departure and reduced still further to just the more similar-sounding voices of Hayward and Lodge (Lodge also providing falsetto vocals and high harmonies), with Pinder and Thomas each having provided both lower and higher-pitched vocal harmonies in the group's earlier vocal sound. The band's vocal \"sound\" had become the blend of just Hayward and Lodge, which was still recognisable, if less textured than the original four-part, more complex \"choral\" sound. Moraz was displeased with Visconti's exclusion of Thomas from the final release of ''Sur La Mer'' and accused him of tailoring the album for radio, as revealed in a 1989 newspaper article where it revealed Moraz's anger with the state of the band and at Visconti in particular.\n\nDespite his diminished participation in the recording process, Thomas' high value remained on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing out his 1960s and 1970s Moodies classics, and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were performed only during Moodies' concerts. The band had begun to reinforce their concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist. ([[Bias Boshell]] was the first, replaced in 1987 by Guy Allison before Boshell returned by 1990), as well as female backing singers.\n\n==1990s to present==\n\n===Departure of Moraz and Court TV lawsuit===\nIn 1991, halfway through the production of their new studio album, Patrick Moraz did an interview with [[Keyboard (magazine)|''Keyboard'' magazine]] and made some comments in the article that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the Moodies. His complaints ranged from the Moodies' music becoming too simple in structure to the other members' reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums. He also was occupied with spending large amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native [[Switzerland]]'s 700th anniversary instead of rehearsing with the Moodies and as a result, he was fired from the group before the project was completed, so Boshell and new keyboardist Paul Bliss were brought in to finish the new album's keyboard tracks. Despite previous credits as an \"official band member\" and being included in group photos on the four '80s studio albums from \"Long Distance Voyager\" to \"Sur La Mer\", subsequent Moodies compilations downplay Moraz to being merely an \"additional keyboardist\" and several band photos have him cropped or airbrushed out, notably on the covers to [[Gold (The Moody Blues album)|''Gold'']] (which did not even mention him in the booklet liner notes, let alone include his picture) and the more recent compilation ''Polydor Years 1986\u20131992''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Moraz later took legal action against the group in the United States and the lawsuit, which he won, was shown on [[Court TV]], but he was awarded only $77,175 in back pay due to accounting slow-ups instead of the $400,000 he sought.\n\n===''Keys of the Kingdom''===\n''[[Keys of the Kingdom]]'', released in 1991, had modest commercial success when released and once again, Hayward's songs led off the album, with the new singles \"[[Say It with Love]]\" and \"[[Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)]].\" Also included was a new ambient flute piece by Ray Thomas entitled \"Celtic Sonant.\" Hayward and Thomas also co-wrote \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\" to close the album. Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did [[Christopher Neil]] and [[Alan Tarney]]. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, \"Highway\", was included on the \"Say It with Love\" twelve-inch single and on a [[Time Traveller (The Moody Blues album)|later box set]] and [[Anthology (The Moody Blues album)|compilation album]], while the vinyl album did not include their song \"Once is Enough\" as on the compact disc version.\n\nThe group remained a steady concert draw, and a series of video and audio versions of their 1992 ''[[A Night at Red Rocks|Night at Red Rocks]]'' concert enjoyed great success, particularly as a fund-raiser for American [[Public broadcasting|public television]] where it had been first broadcast. The concert was conducted and arranged by Larry Baird, who has participated in many other bands' orchestral live concerts, such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Alan Parsons]].\n\nThe group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio, but after the two legal suits from both Pinder in 1981 and Moraz in 1992, the band was careful not to recognise future keyboardists as official members. Following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the 'Keys of the Kingdom' album, Paul Bliss continued to play keyboards for the band live, being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 (but was replaced in March 2010 after 19 years continuous service). Thomas and Bliss continued the tradition of a flute/keyboard duet for many tours. After Edge injured himself in 1991, second drummer Gordon Marshall was brought in to back him up; he stayed with the group after Edge returned and remained in the position until autumn of 2015 when he left to play in a Moody Blues cover band \"Legend of a Band\" and another cover band \"Reflections\".\n\n===''Strange Times'', 1990s tours===\nFrom 1991 to 1998 the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album ''[[Strange Times (Moody Blues album)|Strange Times]]'', their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album's chart performance \u2013 probably not helped by the long recording hiatus \u2013 which was notably less than ''Keys of the Kingdom'' in 1991. It was recorded in [[Recco]], Italy, at Hayward's suggestion, and was the band's first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band. The album opened with \"English Sunset\" a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song \"This Is the Moment\" (which is not on ''Strange Times''), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of ''Jekyll and Hyde'', was a minor hit in the US. ''Strange Times'' was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, \"Nothing Changes\", narrated by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder's 1968 song title \"A Simple Game\". Also in 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called ''[[Viva Ned Flanders]]''.<ref>{{cite video | people=Scully, Mike|year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Viva Ned Flanders\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> On ''Strange Times'' Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\" and his own brief song \"My Little Lovely\", plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward's \"English Sunset\"; this was his recorded vocal swan song with the band.\n\nIn 2000 the band released ''[[Hall of Fame (The Moody Blues album)|Hall of Fame]]'', a new live concert from the [[Royal Albert Hall]], with a concurrent DVD release. This was taken from the last tour on which Boshell played. He left the live line-up in 2001; Bliss took over first keyboard duties, with his former second keyboard role filled by Bernie Barlow and Julie Ragins when Barlow took maternity leave from 2006 to 2009.\n\nIn 2001 an [[IMAX]] film was released entitled ''Journey into Amazing Caves'', which featured two new songs written and performed by the Moody Blues. The soundtrack also featured Justin Hayward performing vocals and playing guitar throughout. One of these songs, entitled \"Water\", is the Moody Blues' first instrumental studio recording since their 1983 piece \"Hole in the World\" from ''The Present'' LP.\n[[File:MoodyBlues.jpg|left|thumb|Hayward and Lodge live in 2007]]\n\n===Thomas retires, ''December''===\nThe new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to the trio of Hayward, Lodge and Edge, the last being the only original member. Flautist and rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their [[North America]]n tour, and has worked with the band live and in the studio since then. Toward the end of 2003, they released an album entitled ''[[December (The Moody Blues album)|December]]''. The songs included originals and four covers: [[John Lennon]]'s \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", Mike Batt's \"A Winter's Tale\", \"When A Child is Born\" and [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"White Christmas\". ''December'' was the group's first album to include covers since their 1965 debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]''.\n\nIn March 2006, the first five of the band's 'Core Seven' albums (the seven albums from ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' to ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'') were re-released in [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format with Deluxe Editions, featuring bonus songs and some rare previously unreleased tracks. In April 2007, the last two of these classic albums were re-released by Universal/Threshold. These deluxe editions were unique for an art rock group like the Moodies in that one of their members, Justin Hayward, was the one taken on to do the work, instead of a professional master technician. Hayward stated that he listened to virgin vinyl copies of these albums and used them as reference points for the new compact discs. On 21 May 2007 the Moodies released a 41-track, two-disc compilation of sessions recorded at BBC Studios, various television appearances and a previously 'lost' performance done on the [[Tom Jones (singer)|''Tom Jones Show'']] titled ''[[Live at the BBC: 1967\u20131970]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moodyblues.co.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814045556/http://moodyblues.co.uk/|url-status= dead|title=MoodyBluesToday.com|archivedate=14 August 2007|website=MoodyBluesToday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |title=The Moody Blues: Live at the BBC: 1967-1970 |publisher=Webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net |accessdate=26 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195337/http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Latest work===\n[[File:MoodyBluesCollage-1000cropped.jpg|thumb|240px|The Moody Blues in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]] in 2005.<br />L\u2013R: Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Graeme Edge]]\nIn 2007, the now defunct [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock Park]] theme park in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], announced the building of a [[dark ride]] entitled \"[[Nights in White Satin: The Trip]]\".

Their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with Ridgepride, which then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", that year which failed to chart. They also appeared on the cult TV programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' singing the uptempo 'B' side \"Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose your Mind)\". But it was their second single, \"[[Go Now]]\" (released later that year), that launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by [[Alex Wharton]]. The single became a hit in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (where it remains their only Number 1 single)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|title=Moody Blues - British Invasion Bands|work=britishinvasionbands.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824084822/http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|archivedate=24 August 2010}}</ref> and in the United States, where it reached No. 10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) directly as recording artists. A four-track [[extended play]] release titled \"The Moody Blues\" featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965.\n\nTheir debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]'', produced by [[Denny Cordell]] with a strong [[Beat music|Merseybeat]]/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] flavour, was released on Decca in mono only in 1965. It contained the hit single together with one side of classic R&B covers, and a second side with four Laine-Pinder originals.\n\nAlex Wharton left the management firm, and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles. They enjoyed a minor British hit with a cover of \"I Don't Want To Go on Without You\" (No. 33) in February 1965, while the Pinder-Laine original \"From the Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)\" produced by Denny Cordell (with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their sound on \"Nights in White Satin\") was issued as a UK single in May 1965 and did a little better (No. 22). But then \"Everyday\", another Pinder-Laine song, stalled at No. 44 in October 1965 and no further British singles were released for about a year. The group was still in demand for live gigs, though, and they had chart success in the US and in Europe during those months when \"Bye Bye Bird\" (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from their album in December 1965 as an overseas single in France (No. 3).\n\nIn June 1966, Warwick retired from the group and the music business. He was briefly replaced by Rod Clark (born Rodney Clark, 23 November 1942, [[Surlingham]], near [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]]), but in early October, Denny Laine also departed from the group,<ref>\"Denny left on Saturday and we\u00b4re not sure what we\u00b4re going to do. We\u00b4re waiting to see [[Brian Epstein]] to talk things over with him.\" Ray Thomas, as quoted by ''Record Mirror'', 8 October 1966: {{cite web |url=http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716143526/http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |archivedate=16 July 2014  }}. Epstein, however, dropped the band almost immediately (same website)</ref> which made Decca release \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" c/w \"This is My House (But Nobody Calls)\" (Decca F 12498, 1966) only a few days later, as the Moody Blues seemed to be disintegrating. Clark joined [[The Rockin' Berries]].\n\nIn the November 1966 issue of ''Hit Week'', Dutch interviewers Hans van Rij and Emie Havers presented their story, saying the Moody Blues had been in the process of recording their second album, ''Look Out'',<ref>see article {{cite web |url=http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217133235/http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |archivedate=17 December 2014  }} on Tony Brown\u00b4s website, taken from ''Hit Week #10'', November 1966, page 5.</ref> with Cordell producing. The album was not to be and \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (released as a single c/w \"Fly Me High\" some months later) is the only song mentioned in the article but the authors say Laine had written all of the material, with Thomas, Pinder and Clark (still the bass player) singing lead vocals as well.\n\nA final 'Mark One' Moodies single, Pinder-Laine's \"Life's Not Life\", was scheduled for release in January 1967 (Decca F 12543) c/w \"He Can Win\" even though Laine<ref>\"I wasn't content to just carry on this gig just to bring money in. Our management thing had all fallen apart. We'd gone with Epstein and that was a disaster.\" Laine interviewed by Mark Murley in ''Higher & Higher # 36, 1997, page 18.</ref> couldn't perform it live because the group had relaunched themselves without him a few months earlier. (This single's release is often listed as being cancelled; however, both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years.)\n\n===Arrival of Hayward and Lodge===\nThe group re-formed in November 1966. By then, \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" had made the Belgian charts and won them more fans, which came in handy when they relocated to Belgium for some time. The new members were [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], their bassist from El Riot who was now finished with his education, and [[Justin Hayward]], formerly of the Wilde Three. Hayward was recommended to Pinder by [[Eric Burdon]] of [[the Animals]] and was endorsed by famed UK singer [[Marty Wilde]], the leader of the Wilde Three. Pinder phoned Hayward after reading his lead guitarist letter, and was impressed when Hayward played him his 45 rpm single \"London is Behind Me\" during their car ride to meet the other members in [[Esher]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAfter financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member, the band soon realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]\", and \"[[Bye Bye Bird]]\", with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer [[Tony Clarke (record producer)|Tony Clarke]], who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's [[mellotron]], was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of [[everyman]].\n\n==Deram Records, Threshold Records, 1967\u20131972==\n\n===''Days of Future Passed''===\n[[File:Moody Blues, Bestanddeelnr 922-1824.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The Moody Blues in the Netherlands (1969)]]\nThe Moody Blues' contract with [[Decca Records]] was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances. The second album had never materialised either. They had the support, however, of Decca A&R manager [[Hugh Mendl]], who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of London/Decca's new subsidiary imprint [[Deram Records]]. With Mendl's backing, the Moody Blues were offered a deal to make a [[rock and roll]] version of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s ''[[Symphony No.&nbsp;9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|New World Symphony]]'' to promote the company's new Deramic Stereo Sound audio format<ref name=\"Eder 2009\">{{cite web |last = Eder |first = Bruce |title = The Moody Blues: Biography |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision] |year = 2009 |url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate = 28 July 2009}}</ref> in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt.\n\nThe Moody Blues agreed, but insisted that they be given artistic control of the project, and Mendl (as executive producer) was able to provide this despite Decca's notoriously tight-fisted attitude to their artists.<ref name=\"INDObit\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html Obituaries \u2013 Hugh Mendl: Producer at Decca Records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517190104/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html |date=17 May 2017 }}; ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 July 2008.</ref> The group was unable to complete the assigned project,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which was abandoned.

Five years later it reached number 3 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the US. The LP was a [[song cycle]] or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day.  The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by [[the Beatles]], to whom Pinder had introduced the mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the [[London Festival Orchestra]],<ref name=pc49>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming!

Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward's \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" (absent on the single) but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording, with the band's rock instrumentation centred on Pinder's mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, the LP was cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable \"linking\" orchestral portion, which the Decca musicians (\"London Festival Orchestra\") then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: \"Redwave-Knight\", although Hayward wrote \"Nights...\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\", Thomas provided \"Another Morning\" and \"Twilight Time\", Lodge penned \"Peak Hour\" and \"Evening (Time To Get Away)\", and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first \"Morning Glory\" and the latter titled \"Late Lament\") read by Mike Pinder who composed both \"The Sun Set\" and \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (sung by Hayward, with Pinder singing the bridge section).\n\nClarke produced the album, and afterwards continued working with the band. Sometimes known to fans as \"The Sixth Moodie\", he produced their albums and singles for the next eleven years. Engineer Derek Varnals also contributed heavily to the creation of the early Moody's studio sound, working with Pinder and Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the mellotron as opposed to the sharp 'cut off' the instrument normally gave, partly achieved by removing all the \"sound effects\" tapes (trains, whistles, cockerel crowing, etc.) and then 'doubling up' the tapes of orchestral instruments' sounds, which combined with Pinder's ability and sensitivity at playing (Pinder having earlier worked for the company that manufactured the mellotron) and Varnals' recording skills at creating an orchestral 'wave' sound that characterised their non-orchestra accompanied sound thereafter.\n\nThe album, plus two singles therefrom, \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" and \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\" (as a medley with \"Forever Afternoon,\" listed as \"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\" on the album), took time to find an audience. In the Moody Blues' native Britain, the two singles from the album didn't initially catch on; \"Nights in White Satin\" made only No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart|British singles chart]] in early 1968, and \"Tuesday Afternoon\" didn't chart at all. However, the British public learned to appreciate \"Nights in White Satin\" subsequently; it made No. 9 on the UK singles chart on re-issue in December 1972 and No. 14 on the charts on another reissue at the end of 1979, and is now regarded as the Moody Blues signature song by British audiences. In the US, \"Nights in White Satin\" did not make the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1968, although it reached No. 2 on re-release in 1972; \"Tuesday Afternoon\" was more successful on initial release stateside, peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n===''In Search of the Lost Chord''===\nThe 1968 follow-up LP, ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]'' included \"[[Legend of a Mind]]\", a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to [[LSD]] guru [[Timothy Leary]] which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas \u2013 four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at [[Groot-Bijgaarden Castle]] near [[Brussels]] in Belgium. Lodge provided a two-part song \"House of Four Doors\" set either side of Thomas' epic piece. [[Justin Hayward]] began playing [[sitar]] and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (\"Voices...\", \"Visions of Paradise\", \"Om\", etc.), having been inspired by [[George Harrison]]. Hayward's \"Voices in the Sky\" charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge's \"Ride My See-Saw\" (No. 42, No. 15 in France) \u2013 still their concert finale number \u2013 which featured Pinder's non-album song \"A Simple Game\" as the 'B' side. Pinder's \"The Best Way to Travel\" was another high point, as was his closing song \"Om\" (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that  followed. Edge narrated his brief \"Departure\" poem on \"Lost Chord\", although Pinder recited the majority of Edge's poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more [[whisky]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|title=Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge interviewed - TechnologyTell|work=TechnologyTell|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129021244/http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|archivedate=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''On the Threshold of a Dream''===\n\nOn 1969's ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'', Hayward, Edge and Pinder share the opening narration on Edge's \"In The Beginning\", leading into Hayward's \"Lovely To See You\". His \"Never Comes the Day\" was issued as a UK single, while Thomas' wry observations of life in \"Dear Diary\" and \"Lazy Day\" were striking features. Pinder contributed the closing track on side one, \"So Deep Within You\". Side two closed with the \"Dream Sequence\", Edge's poem \"The Dream\" leading into Pinder's \"Have You Heard?\" parts I and II with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece \"The Voyage\".\n\n===''To Our Children's Children's Children''===\nThe band's music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of [[reverberation]] on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969's ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]''&nbsp;\u2013 a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track \"Higher and Higher\" saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge's lyrics. Thomas' \"Floating\" and \"Eternity Road\" stood out, as did Hayward's \"Gypsy\" and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration \"Out and In\". Lodge provided his two-part \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Candle of Life\" while Pinder contributed \"Sun is Still Shining\". The album closed with \"[[Watching and Waiting]]\", composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label \"Threshold\" under licence to Decca Records. ''To Our Children's Children's Children'' was the first of their albums to be released on their own label. The song \"Watching and Waiting\" was issued as a single on the Threshold label, but failed to chart.\n\n===''A Question of Balance''===\n\nAlthough the Moodies had by now defined a somewhat [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] style and helped to define the [[progressive rock]] (then also known as 'art rock') sound, the group decided to record an album that could be played in concert, losing some of their full-blown sound for ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' (1970). This album, reaching No. 3 in the American charts and No. 1 in the British charts, was indicative of the band's growing success in America. Hayward's \"Question\" (in a different version) was issued as a single, reaching No. 2 in the UK (kept from the top spot only by the England World Cup football team's novelty record \"Back Home\"). Justin Hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous [[effects pedals]] and [[distortion (music)|fuzzboxes]] and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound. The Moody Blues had by now become a bill-topping act in their own right. They appeared twice at the famous [[Isle of Wight Festival]] (A DVD of their 1970 performance has been released). Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\" (a No.1 single in France) stood out beside Hayward's \"Question\" on the 1970 album.\n\n===''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' and ''Seventh Sojourn''===\nFor their next two albums, ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' (1971) \u2013 from which Hayward's \"[[The Story in Your Eyes]]\" was taken as a US charting single (No. 23) \u2013 and ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'' (1972) (which reached No. 1 in the US), the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which, while difficult to reproduce in concert, had become their trademark. The title \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a [[mnemonic]] used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track \"Procession\" was the only item composed by all five band members, a fascinating track depicting the \"evolution\" of music, leading into Hayward's \"Story in Your Eyes\". Thomas's reflective \"Our Guessing Game\" and whimsical \"Nice To Be Here\" offset the deeper drama of Hayward's \"You Can Never Go Home\", Lodge's \"One More Time To Live\" and Pinder's \"My Song\". Edge, the long-standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken \u2013 his \"After You Came\" (1971) featured each of the four lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972, Lodge's songs \"Isn't Life Strange?\" (No. 13) and \"[[I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)]]\" (No. 36) were lifted from ''Seventh Sojourn'' as charting UK singles. ''Sojourn'' also saw Pinder using the new [[Chamberlin]] instrument in place of the mellotron and Edge using an electronic drum kit. Pinder's stirring lament \"Lost in a Lost World\" opened this last \"Core Seven\" outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary \"When You're a Free Man\", Thomas's romantic \"For My Lady\", and Hayward's serene \"New Horizons\" all stood out.\n\nIn an interview following the release of ''Seventh Sojourn'', Graeme Edge told Rolling Stone: \"We've got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travellingeternityroad.yuku.com/topic/6649/Threshold-Records-The-Shop?page=2#.VLxJvigrxT5 |title=Threshold Records (The Shop) in Moody Blues Hall Forum |publisher=Travellingeternityroad.yuku.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder's songs \"A Simple Game\" (1968) and \"So Deep Within You\" (1969) were successfully covered by [[the Four Tops]], Pinder winning an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for \"A Simple Game\", [[Elkie Brooks]] later covered Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\". Pinder also appeared on [[John Lennon]]'s \"Imagine\" album in 1971, providing additional percussion on \"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don't Want to Die)\". The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas's \"Hopes, Wishes & Dreams\" in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers.\n\nIn late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old \"Nights in White Satin\" became the Moody Blues' biggest US hit, soaring to number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had \"bubbled under\" the Hot 100 charts on its original release. The song also returned to the UK charts, reaching No. 9, ten places higher than its original release in 1967.\n\n===Threshold Records===\nThe Moodies were also among the pioneers of the idea that a successful rock band could promote itself through their own label, following the Beatles' creation of [[Apple Records]]. After their ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'' album (1969), they created ''[[Threshold Records]]'', prompted in part by disputes with London/Deram over album design costs (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). The idea was for Threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to London/Decca who would act as distributor. The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent&nbsp;\u2013 most notably the UK [[hard rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] and the [[Portland, Oregon]], classical-acoustic sextet [[Providence (band)|Providence]]&nbsp;\u2013 but these efforts were unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts. However, they helped lay groundwork for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals, including [[the Rolling Stones]]' own label and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]],{{citation needed|reason=according to whom? Very different reasons for this have been stated by members of both groups, none of which reflected the MB's|date=April 2015}} and all of the Moodies' studio releases from 1969 to 1999 bore the [[Threshold Records|Threshold]] logo on at least one of their format versions.\n\n==A break and solo work, 1974\u20131977==\nIn the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of [[Asia]], the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of ''Higher & Higher'' magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] (as the \"[[Caught Live + 5]]\" album displayed. Caught Live + 5 was a live double album recorded c. 1969 but released c. 1977 with five previously unreleased studio tracks from 1967-69 added.)\n\nBefore the band's 1973\u201374 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \"Island\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album ''[[This Is The Moody Blues]]'' which was released that year.\n\nHayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'' (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with [[10cc]] backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album ''The Promise.\"''<ref>[http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130649/http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml|date=20 June 2007}}</ref> Edge produced two albums with guitarist [[Adrian Gurvitz]] and his brother Paul Gurvitz, ''Kick Off Your Muddy Boots'' (1975) and ''Paradise Ballroom'' (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]'' (1977), which was followed up a few years later by ''[[Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)|Night Flight]]'' (1980), ''[[Moving Mountains (Justin Hayward album)|Moving Mountains]]'' (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) ''[[Classic Blue]]'' (1989), ''[[The View from the Hill (album)|The View From The Hill]]'' (1996) and ''[[Live in San Juan Capistrano (album)|Live in San Juan Capistrano]]'' (1998); Lodge released ''[[Natural Avenue (album)|Natural Avenue]]'' (1977); Pinder produced ''[[The Promise (Mike Pinder album)|The Promise]]'' (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing ''[[From Mighty Oaks (album)|From Mighty Oaks]]'' (1975) and ''[[Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (album)|Hopes, Wishes and Dreams]]'' (1976).\n\n==Reunion, 1977\u20131990==\n\n===Reunion===\n[[File:Moody Blues.jpg|thumb|1978\u201390 line-up. L-R: [[Patrick Moraz]], [[Ray Thomas]], [[Graeme Edge]], [[Justin Hayward]] and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]]]]\nIn 1977, the group made a decision to record together again, with their record company Decca urging a reunion album. [[London Records]] decided to release a somewhat poorly mixed eight-year-old recording of the band performing at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], against their artistic wishes. London/Decca did this in an attempt to re-energise public interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album, but by this time Pinder had remarried and started a family in [[California]], so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked with tension and division: first there was a fire at the studios they were using, then after quickly relocating to Pinder's home studio, a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them, inevitably causing tensions to rise (with Pinder then dropping out before completion).\n\nClarke was also forced to leave because of non-musical reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, and by then probably considering the band's touring days behind them, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. His decision caused acrimony within the band (notably from Edge) and Ray Thomas had said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring, but his opting out later on (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a severely embarrassing blow to them. Attempts were made by their management to downplay Pinder's absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a \"welcome back\" speech, openly referred to \"Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the [[United States|States]]\", much to their dismay.\n\n===''Octave'', Pinder departs and the arrival of Moraz, ''Long Distance Voyager'' and ''The Present''===\nDuring this period, the prog-rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] had asked their keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]], to leave, and he joined the Moody Blues as keyboardist for the Octave World Tour. The album sold well and produced the hits \"[[Steppin' in a Slide Zone]]\", (no. 39 US) and \"[[Driftwood (The Moody Blues song)|Driftwood]]\", (no. 59 US). On ''Octave'', Hayward had four solo compositions, whilst Edge contributed \"I'll Be Level With You\" (aka \"Little Man\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Moody Blues toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. A live CD ''The Moody Blues Live in Seattle 1979'' during the ''Octave'' tour of a concert at [[Key Arena|Seattle Center Coliseum]] recorded on 25 May 1979 was later issued in 2013. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer [[Pip Williams]]. Moraz was retained as the band's permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder took legal action to prevent the new Moody Blues album from reaching the public without his contributions, but he was not successful, and ultimately, he never returned to the fold. Nevertheless, when released in 1981, ''[[Long Distance Voyager]]'' was a colossal success, reaching No. 1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' and going Top 5 in the UK. The album yielded two hits, \"[[The Voice (The Moody Blues song)|The Voice]]\", (No. 15 US) written by Hayward, and \"[[Gemini Dream]]\", (No. 12 US) written by Hayward and Lodge. John Lodge's \"Talking out of Turn\" also charted in the US, reaching No. 65. Edge provided \"22,000 Days\" (featuring Thomas as lead voice with Hayward and Lodge) while Thomas' contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs; \"Painted Smile\", \"Reflective Smile\" (a poem narrated by a DJ friend of the band) and \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\". By now, the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound as Moraz gave a more contemporary edge{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In live concerts, the mellotron was still used heavily by Moraz until the mid-1980s, including on songs that did not originally feature it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |title=Stepping In A Slide Zone \u2013 LIVE |publisher=YouTube |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625014810/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |archivedate=25 June 2014  }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Present]]'' (1983), again produced by Williams, was less successful than its predecessor, though it spawned a UK Top 40 hit (No. 35) in \"[[Blue World (The Moody Blues song)|Blue World]]\" (No. 62 in the US) and a US Top 40 hit in \"[[Sitting at the Wheel]]\" (which failed to chart in the UK). Videos were also produced for both singles. ''The Present'' was released in conjunction with Talencora Ltd shortly before Decca was bought out by [[Polydor Records]].\n\n===''The Other Side of Life'', ''Sur la Mer''===\nIn 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album ''[[The Other Side of Life]]'' and in particular with the track \"[[Your Wildest Dreams]]\" \u2013 a US Top 10 hit (and No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks) which garnered a [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Video of the Year award after being frequently featured on [[MTV]]. Newly employed producer [[Tony Visconti]] and Barry Radman, a synth programmer formerly engaged by Moraz, delivered a modern sound the Moodies had been seeking in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries and the album's title song also charted in the US, at No. 58. The renewed interest in the band ensured a younger audience, with many of their longtime followers remaining loyal despite a fair number of older fans finding the albums of this period far more lightweight in content - for example, Lodge had gone from writing powerfully reflective mystical or humanitarian themed pieces such as \"House of Four Doors\", \"Candle of Life\" and \"One More Time to Live\" to quirkier items such as \"Here Comes the Weekend\", \"Rock and Roll Over You\" and \"Love is on the Run (From Me)\" while Hayward's songs seemed{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} less the deeper drama of numbers such as \"The Actor\", \"Dawning is the Day\", \"You Can Never Go Home\", \"The Land of Make Believe\", etc., to pleasant (and more radio-friendly) perennial far simpler songs about lost love and romance (\"Your Wildest Dreams\", \"No More Lies\", \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" etc.). There were still some deeper songs being created by the band, (\"The Voice\", \"22,000 Days\", \"The Other Side of Life\", \"The Spirit\", \"Deep\", etc.) but the overall tone had noticeably become a more lightweight commercialised one; presumably this was with record company agreement to keep in accordance with the then prevailing times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Their live shows from this period included a good number of their 1980s album tracks.  However, over time, more of the \"Core Seven\" album era favourites reappeared in their playlist, but Pinder's compositions were permanently retired from their setlists after his departure.\n\nThe Moody Blues performed live at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]] which raised money for [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]]. The band played four songs, and later provided backup with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] for [[George Harrison]].\n\nThe Moodies continued their early video-generation success with ''[[Sur La Mer]]'' (1988) and its video and single, \"[[I Know You're Out There Somewhere]]\" (No. 30 US, No. 52 UK, No. 2 US Mainstream Rock), a sequel to \"Your Wildest Dreams\". Their sound took on an ever-increasingly synthetic and technical quality as Moraz and Visconti began using modern sequencers, samplers and drum machines. Hayward and Lodge wrote and sang on most of the songs as the band came under pressure from their new record company, [[Polydor Records]], to promote those it deemed to be the two more commercial looking and sounding members and they decided to exploit that aspect rather than catering for the band as a whole or retaining the five-way songwriting methods the group had done with Pinder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |title=The Moody Blues: In Review \u2022 Sur La Mer (1988) |publisher=Runstop.de |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=26 August 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715175641/http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |archivedate=15 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\nBy then, Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio with the band evolving into a [[synthpop]] act, a genre that was unsuitable for the use of a flute. Thomas provided additional percussion, notably a brisk tambourine, on many more Moodies songs which continued to be featured, plus occasional harmonica, but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer and he was also unwell during this period, further limiting his involvement with the band in the recording studio.\n\nThomas provided some backing vocals for both ''The Other Side of Life'' and ''Sur La Mer''; however, for reasons unclear, multiple production considerations led Visconti to leave Thomas' vocals off the latter of these two albums, thereby further reducing the texture of their overall vocal sound, which had previously been rich four-part harmonies (Hayward, Lodge, Thomas and Pinder), then went down to three (Thomas, Lodge and Hayward) upon Pinder's departure and reduced still further to just the more similar-sounding voices of Hayward and Lodge (Lodge also providing falsetto vocals and high harmonies), with Pinder and Thomas each having provided both lower and higher-pitched vocal harmonies in the group's earlier vocal sound. The band's vocal \"sound\" had become the blend of just Hayward and Lodge, which was still recognisable, if less textured than the original four-part, more complex \"choral\" sound. Moraz was displeased with Visconti's exclusion of Thomas from the final release of ''Sur La Mer'' and accused him of tailoring the album for radio, as revealed in a 1989 newspaper article where it revealed Moraz's anger with the state of the band and at Visconti in particular.\n\nDespite his diminished participation in the recording process, Thomas' high value remained on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing out his 1960s and 1970s Moodies classics, and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were performed only during Moodies' concerts. The band had begun to reinforce their concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist. ([[Bias Boshell]] was the first, replaced in 1987 by Guy Allison before Boshell returned by 1990), as well as female backing singers.\n\n==1990s to present==\n\n===Departure of Moraz and Court TV lawsuit===\nIn 1991, halfway through the production of their new studio album, Patrick Moraz did an interview with [[Keyboard (magazine)|''Keyboard'' magazine]] and made some comments in the article that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the Moodies. His complaints ranged from the Moodies' music becoming too simple in structure to the other members' reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums. He also was occupied with spending large amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native [[Switzerland]]'s 700th anniversary instead of rehearsing with the Moodies and as a result, he was fired from the group before the project was completed, so Boshell and new keyboardist Paul Bliss were brought in to finish the new album's keyboard tracks. Despite previous credits as an \"official band member\" and being included in group photos on the four '80s studio albums from \"Long Distance Voyager\" to \"Sur La Mer\", subsequent Moodies compilations downplay Moraz to being merely an \"additional keyboardist\" and several band photos have him cropped or airbrushed out, notably on the covers to [[Gold (The Moody Blues album)|''Gold'']] (which did not even mention him in the booklet liner notes, let alone include his picture) and the more recent compilation ''Polydor Years 1986\u20131992''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Moraz later took legal action against the group in the United States and the lawsuit, which he won, was shown on [[Court TV]], but he was awarded only $77,175 in back pay due to accounting slow-ups instead of the $400,000 he sought.\n\n===''Keys of the Kingdom''===\n''[[Keys of the Kingdom]]'', released in 1991, had modest commercial success when released and once again, Hayward's songs led off the album, with the new singles \"[[Say It with Love]]\" and \"[[Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)]].\" Also included was a new ambient flute piece by Ray Thomas entitled \"Celtic Sonant.\" Hayward and Thomas also co-wrote \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\" to close the album. Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did [[Christopher Neil]] and [[Alan Tarney]]. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, \"Highway\", was included on the \"Say It with Love\" twelve-inch single and on a [[Time Traveller (The Moody Blues album)|later box set]] and [[Anthology (The Moody Blues album)|compilation album]], while the vinyl album did not include their song \"Once is Enough\" as on the compact disc version.\n\nThe group remained a steady concert draw, and a series of video and audio versions of their 1992 ''[[A Night at Red Rocks|Night at Red Rocks]]'' concert enjoyed great success, particularly as a fund-raiser for American [[Public broadcasting|public television]] where it had been first broadcast. The concert was conducted and arranged by Larry Baird, who has participated in many other bands' orchestral live concerts, such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Alan Parsons]].\n\nThe group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio, but after the two legal suits from both Pinder in 1981 and Moraz in 1992, the band was careful not to recognise future keyboardists as official members. Following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the 'Keys of the Kingdom' album, Paul Bliss continued to play keyboards for the band live, being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 (but was replaced in March 2010 after 19 years continuous service). Thomas and Bliss continued the tradition of a flute/keyboard duet for many tours. After Edge injured himself in 1991, second drummer Gordon Marshall was brought in to back him up; he stayed with the group after Edge returned and remained in the position until autumn of 2015 when he left to play in a Moody Blues cover band \"Legend of a Band\" and another cover band \"Reflections\".\n\n===''Strange Times'', 1990s tours===\nFrom 1991 to 1998 the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album ''[[Strange Times (Moody Blues album)|Strange Times]]'', their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album's chart performance \u2013 probably not helped by the long recording hiatus \u2013 which was notably less than ''Keys of the Kingdom'' in 1991. It was recorded in [[Recco]], Italy, at Hayward's suggestion, and was the band's first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band. The album opened with \"English Sunset\" a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song \"This Is the Moment\" (which is not on ''Strange Times''), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of ''Jekyll and Hyde'', was a minor hit in the US. ''Strange Times'' was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, \"Nothing Changes\", narrated by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder's 1968 song title \"A Simple Game\". Also in 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called ''[[Viva Ned Flanders]]''.<ref>{{cite video | people=Scully, Mike|year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Viva Ned Flanders\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> On ''Strange Times'' Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\" and his own brief song \"My Little Lovely\", plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward's \"English Sunset\"; this was his recorded vocal swan song with the band.\n\nIn 2000 the band released ''[[Hall of Fame (The Moody Blues album)|Hall of Fame]]'', a new live concert from the [[Royal Albert Hall]], with a concurrent DVD release. This was taken from the last tour on which Boshell played. He left the live line-up in 2001; Bliss took over first keyboard duties, with his former second keyboard role filled by Bernie Barlow and Julie Ragins when Barlow took maternity leave from 2006 to 2009.\n\nIn 2001 an [[IMAX]] film was released entitled ''Journey into Amazing Caves'', which featured two new songs written and performed by the Moody Blues. The soundtrack also featured Justin Hayward performing vocals and playing guitar throughout. One of these songs, entitled \"Water\", is the Moody Blues' first instrumental studio recording since their 1983 piece \"Hole in the World\" from ''The Present'' LP.\n[[File:MoodyBlues.jpg|left|thumb|Hayward and Lodge live in 2007]]\n\n===Thomas retires, ''December''===\nThe new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to the trio of Hayward, Lodge and Edge, the last being the only original member. Flautist and rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their [[North America]]n tour, and has worked with the band live and in the studio since then. Toward the end of 2003, they released an album entitled ''[[December (The Moody Blues album)|December]]''. The songs included originals and four covers: [[John Lennon]]'s \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", Mike Batt's \"A Winter's Tale\", \"When A Child is Born\" and [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"White Christmas\". ''December'' was the group's first album to include covers since their 1965 debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]''.\n\nIn March 2006, the first five of the band's 'Core Seven' albums (the seven albums from ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' to ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'') were re-released in [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format with Deluxe Editions, featuring bonus songs and some rare previously unreleased tracks. In April 2007, the last two of these classic albums were re-released by Universal/Threshold. These deluxe editions were unique for an art rock group like the Moodies in that one of their members, Justin Hayward, was the one taken on to do the work, instead of a professional master technician. Hayward stated that he listened to virgin vinyl copies of these albums and used them as reference points for the new compact discs. On 21 May 2007 the Moodies released a 41-track, two-disc compilation of sessions recorded at BBC Studios, various television appearances and a previously 'lost' performance done on the [[Tom Jones (singer)|''Tom Jones Show'']] titled ''[[Live at the BBC: 1967\u20131970]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moodyblues.co.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814045556/http://moodyblues.co.uk/|url-status= dead|title=MoodyBluesToday.com|archivedate=14 August 2007|website=MoodyBluesToday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |title=The Moody Blues: Live at the BBC: 1967-1970 |publisher=Webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net |accessdate=26 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195337/http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Latest work===\n[[File:MoodyBluesCollage-1000cropped.jpg|thumb|240px|The Moody Blues in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]] in 2005.<br />L\u2013R: Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Graeme Edge]]\nIn 2007, the now defunct [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock Park]] theme park in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], announced the building of a [[dark ride]] entitled \"[[Nights in White Satin: The Trip]]\". The ride incorporated multi-sensory experiences as well as a re-orchestrated version of the song by Justin Hayward. A re-recorded version of Graeme Edge's \"Late Lament\" again followed, which had each group member reading a verse of the poem.<ref>[http://www.screamscape.com/html/hard_rock_park.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093153/http://www.screamscape.com/html/hard_rock_park.htm|date=7 August 2007}}</ref> In March 2009, the ride closed because of the conversion of the park to the [[Freestyle Music Park]], with the new owners desiring to make the park more \"family friendly.\"\n\nThe group toured the UK, Canada and the US in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. In addition, Hayward took part in the UK tour of ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' in April 2006, and a second tour in November 2007, also with dates in 2009. The Moody Blues also toured Australia and New Zealand in 2006. Their long-time producer, Tony Clarke, died in January 2010. The band added keyboardist [[Alan Hewitt (musician)|Alan Hewitt]] for their 2010 UK and North American tours.\n\nThey released a new compilation album called ''Timeless Flight'' in 2013.

He stated: \"Despite their success, rock critics rarely took the Moody Blues seriously, a pattern that continued for the next 45 years.\" He also wrote: \"Despite the critical disapproval, the best of the Moody Blues music between 1967 and 1970 possessed grace and beauty.

By 1967, KFMK moved to a Top 40 format, competing against [[KRBE]] and had a slight advantage over KRBE because it was in stereo, although the latter had a stronger signal at the time.\n\nBy May 1968, KFMK transitioned to become Houston's first [[progressive rock]] station, known as \"Mother Radio\" (a name later referenced by [[KLOL]], which was known as \"Mother's Family\"). In early 1969, KFMK abruptly changed to a Christian format. The station reverted to [[Top 40]] in the late 1970s, which would then transition to an [[oldies]]-heavy [[adult contemporary]] format in the 1980s. This format lasted until the station's abrupt 1991 flip to what was then coined as \"Contemporary Crossover\".\n\n===\"The Box\"===\nOn April 2, 1991, after a period of [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]], the station flipped to \"The Box\" with a new [[rhythmic contemporary]] format.

In early 1969, KFMK abruptly changed to a Christian format. The station reverted to [[Top 40]] in the late 1970s, which would then transition to an [[oldies]]-heavy [[adult contemporary]] format in the 1980s.

Although not an integral part of its territory, [[Clipperton Island]] was administered from French Polynesia until 2007.\n\nFollowing the [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|Great Polynesian Migration]], European explorers visited the islands of French Polynesia on several occasions. Traders and whaling ships also visited. In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9tablissements fran\u00e7ais d'Oc\u00e9anie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements of Oceania).\n\nIn 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. In 1983 French Polynesia became a member of the [[Pacific Community]], a regional development organization. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie et de la Polyn\u00e9sie|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floreal-Bora-Bora.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The French frigate ''[[Flor\u00e9al (F 730)|Flor\u00e9al]]'' in November 2002, stationed in [[Bora Bora]] lagoon]]\n\nScientists believe the Great Polynesian Migration commenced around 1500 BC as [[Austronesian peoples]] went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the South Pacific Ocean.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]] (the territorial assembly).\n\nPolitical life in French Polynesia has been marked by great instability since the mid-2000s. On 14 September 2007, the pro-independence leader [[Oscar Temaru]], was elected president of French Polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes cast in the territorial assembly).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6994513.stm |title=BBC NEWS, French Polynesia gets new leader |work=BBC News  |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> He replaced former president [[Gaston Tong Sang]], opposed to independence, who lost a [[no-confidence vote]] in the Assembly of French Polynesia on 31 August after the longtime former president of French Polynesia, [[Gaston Flosse]], hitherto opposed to independence, sided with his long enemy Oscar Temaru to topple the government of Gaston Tong Sang. Oscar Temaru, however, had no stable majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia, and new territorial elections were held in February 2008 to solve the political crisis.\n\n[[File:Assembl\u00e9e de Polyn\u00e9sie.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Assembly of French Polynesia]]]]\nThe party of Gaston Tong Sang won the territorial elections, but that did not solve the political crisis: the two minority parties of Oscar Temaru and Gaston Flosse, who together have one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of Gaston Tong Sang, allied to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia. Gaston Flosse was then elected president of French Polynesia by the territorial assembly on 23 February 2008 with the support of the pro-independence party led by Oscar Temaru, while Oscar Temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse. Both formed a coalition cabinet. Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru, designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia, could last very long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304152635/http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 French municipal elections|French municipal elections held in March 2008]], several prominent mayors who are member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Bora Bora, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|[[Bora Bora]]]]\nBetween 1946 and 2003, French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (''{{lang|fr|[[territoire d'outre-mer]]}}'', or ''TOM''). In 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (''{{lang|fr|[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]}}'', or COM). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of ''[[overseas country of France|overseas country inside the Republic]]'' (''{{lang|fr|pays d'outre-mer au sein de la R\u00e9publique}}'', or POM), but without legal modification of its status.\n\n=== Relations with mainland France ===\n[[File:Haut Commissariat \u00e0 Papeete.JPG|thumb|High Commission of the [[French Fifth Republic]]]]\nDespite a local assembly and government, French Polynesia is not in a [[Associated state|free association]] with France, like the [[Cook Islands]] with [[New Zealand]]. As a French overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France, including the [[National Gendarmerie]] (which also polices rural and border areas in metropolitan France), and [[French Armed Forces|French military forces]]. The collectivity government retains control over primary and secondary education, health, town planning, and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/french-polynesia-last-vestiges-of-frances-empire/|title=French Polynesia Battles for Independence|author1=Rachel Reeves |author2=Luke Hunt |author3=The Diplomat |work=The Diplomat|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>  The highest representative of the State in the territory is the [[High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia]] ({{lang-fr|Haut commissaire de la R\u00e9publique en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise}}).\n\nFrench Polynesia also sends three [[Member of Parliament|deputies]] to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], one representing the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]] [[Administrative divisions of French Polynesia|administrative subdivision]] and the south-western suburbs of Papeete, another one representing Papeete and its north-eastern suburbs, plus the [[Communes of France|commune]] (municipality) of [[Moorea-Maiao|Mo'orea-Mai'ao]], the [[\u00celes Tuamotu-Gambier|Tu\u0101motu-Gambier]] administrative division, and the Marquesas Islands administrative division, and the last one representing the rest of Tahiti and the Austral Islands administrative subdivision.

In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9tablissements fran\u00e7ais d'Oc\u00e9anie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements of Oceania).\n\nIn 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. In 1983 French Polynesia became a member of the [[Pacific Community]], a regional development organization. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie et de la Polyn\u00e9sie|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floreal-Bora-Bora.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The French frigate ''[[Flor\u00e9al (F 730)|Flor\u00e9al]]'' in November 2002, stationed in [[Bora Bora]] lagoon]]\n\nScientists believe the Great Polynesian Migration commenced around 1500 BC as [[Austronesian peoples]] went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the South Pacific Ocean.

Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow.
