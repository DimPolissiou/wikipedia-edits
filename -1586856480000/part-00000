He created the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' series while at [[Origin Systems]] and is now working on the [[crowdfunded]] space simulator ''[[Star Citizen]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Redwood City, California]] in the United States, Roberts grew up in [[Manchester]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,6555/|title=Chris Roberts|publisher=Moby games|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}</ref> He attended [[Parrs Wood High School]], the same school as computer music composer [[Martin Galway]].

''Wing Commander'' (and the franchise it spawned) soon became Origin's most successful product. Roberts wasn't as heavily involved in the sequel ''[[Wing Commander II]]'', which he only produced. He instead concentrated on ''[[Strike Commander]]''. First shown to the public at Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 1991, the project suffered from numerous delays and was not released until 1993. He returned to ''Wing Commander'' soon after, devising the original concept for the spin-off ''[[Wing Commander: Privateer]]'' (which his brother, Erin Roberts, produced) and being more deeply involved in ''[[Wing Commander III]]'' and ''[[Wing Commander IV]]''. For these sequels, Roberts directed the live-action cinematic scenes.

Roberts left the company after the acquisition, abandoning the director position of his ambitious project ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'', although he remained with the game in a consulting role for a while.

Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt [[New York City]] following the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity as he plots to assassinate both the presidential candidate (Harris) for whom the woman he is infatuated with (Shepherd) works, and the pimp (Keitel) of an [[Child prostitution|underage prostitute]] (Foster) he befriends. He dies silly!!\n\nWIKI IS WRONG!! T-R-A-V-I- IS DEAD! A critical and commercial success upon release and nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster), ''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film generated controversy at the time of its release for its depiction of violence and casting of a 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994. Travis later dies while he is bleeding out from a gsw.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, [[Travis Bickle]] is a lonely, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] 26-year-old living in isolation in [[New York City]]. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[Adult movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him. One evening, an unhinged racist passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his [[Adultery|adulterous]] wife and her black lover. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; however, Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\". ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved August 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nWhen Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]]. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"<ref name=\"Rausch\">{{cite book |last=Rausch |first=Andrew J. |title=The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro |location= |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8108-7413-8}}</ref>\n\n=== De Niro's preparation for the role ===\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;... But New York and Times Square was shuddering and disgusting. It's just exciting to see the city bounce back and become the great place it is today from where it was then.

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.

Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt [[New York City]] following the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity as he plots to assassinate both the presidential candidate (Harris) for whom the woman he is infatuated with (Shepherd) works, and the pimp (Keitel) of an [[Child prostitution|underage prostitute]] (Foster) he befriends. He dies silly!!\n\nA critical and commercial success upon release and nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster), ''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film generated controversy at the time of its release for its depiction of violence and casting of a 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994. Travis later dies while he is bleeding out from a gsw.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, [[Travis Bickle]] is a lonely, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] 26-year-old living in isolation in [[New York City]]. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[Adult movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him. One evening, an unhinged racist passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his [[Adultery|adulterous]] wife and her black lover. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; however, Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\". ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved August 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nWhen Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]]. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"<ref name=\"Rausch\">{{cite book |last=Rausch |first=Andrew J. |title=The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro |location= |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8108-7413-8}}</ref>\n\n=== De Niro's preparation for the role ===\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;... But New York and Times Square was shuddering and disgusting. It's just exciting to see the city bounce back and become the great place it is today from where it was then.

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.

Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed the form of the ferocious [[Gandaberunda]] bird-animal to combat Sharabha, in which Sharabha released his invincible [[Shakti]], known as [[Pratyangira]] [[Devi]] to destroy Gandaberunda. In [[Buddhism]], Sharabha appears in [[Jataka Tales]] as a previous birth of [[the Buddha]].\n\nSharabha also appears in the emblem of [[Government of Karnataka|State government]] of the Indian state of [[Karnataka]], [[University of Mysore]] and the [[Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited]].\n\n==Development of character and iconography==\nIn Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is initially described as an animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the great epic [[Mahabharata]], this form of Sharabha was defined as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount [[Krauncha]] but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount [[Gandhamadana]]. The epic also includes Sharabha in the list of edible animals - the ''mrigajatis''- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha appears primarily as the incarnation of Lord [[Shiva]], as a name of a monkey-king in the epic [[Ramayana]], also as a proper name of heroes and serpent [[N\u0101ga]]s and one of the names of god [[Vishnu]] as well as [[Buddha]].<ref name=\"Hopkins\">{{cite book| last = Hopkins| first = E.

In Khamikagama, Sharabha is described in the form of a bird with golden color, with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs in the form of a lion touching the ground, four legs with claws upwards, and with an animal tail.

The other images are at [[Darasuram]] and [[Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam|Kampahareshvarar temple]], [[Thirubuvanam]] built by a Chola ruler, [[Kulottunga Chola III]] where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.<ref name=\"Smith \">{{cite book| last = Smith| first = David| title = The Dance of Siva Religion, Art and Poetry in South India Volume 7 of Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EvknQEACAAJ&pg=PA191| accessdate = 2010-01-15| year = 2003| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52865-8| page = 193 }}</ref>\n\nA sculpture of Sharbeshwaramurti in the Tribhuvanam temple, a Shiva temple in [[Tanjore district]], in [[Tamil Nadu]] is seen with three legs, with body and face of a lion and a tail.

But one common refrain in all these depictions is that Sharabha is a combination of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as [[Narasimha]] (man-lion) or [[Varaha]] (the boar).\n\nThe Narasimha-Sharabha legend is linked to gods assuming mythical animal forms to slay or subdue as the case may be. First, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay [[Hiranyakashipu]], an [[asura]] (demon) king, who was terrorizing the universe and devotee of Shiva.<ref name=Pattanaik/><ref name= Blurton/> The [[Shiva Purana]] mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha's wrath was not appeased. The world trembled, fearing what he might do. The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (the gods) requested Shiva to tackle Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as the human-lion-bird Sharabha, with [[Pratyangira]] and Soolini, Shiva's female energies, forming his wings. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and immobilized him by deploying Pratyangira as a weapon. He thus quelled Narasimha's terrifying rage and restored sattva back into him.

The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Narasimha struck Sharabha with his body, it was Vishnu who groaned in pain and not Sharabha who was in an \"adamantine body\".

Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the great epic [[Mahabharata]], this form of Sharabha was defined as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount [[Krauncha]] but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount [[Gandhamadana]]. The epic also includes Sharabha in the list of edible animals - the ''mrigajatis''- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha appears primarily as the incarnation of Lord [[Shiva]], as a name of a monkey-king in the epic [[Ramayana]], also as a proper name of heroes and serpent [[N\u0101ga]]s and one of the names of god [[Vishnu]] as well as [[Buddha]].<ref name=\"Hopkins\">{{cite book| last = Hopkins| first = E.

But one common refrain in all these depictions is that Sharabha is a combination of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as [[Narasimha]] (man-lion) or [[Varaha]] (the boar).\n\nThe Narasimha-Sharabha legend is linked to gods assuming mythical animal forms to slay or subdue as the case may be. First, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay [[Hiranyakashipu]], an [[asura]] (demon) king, who was terrorizing the universe and devotee of Shiva.<ref name=Pattanaik/><ref name= Blurton/> The [[Shiva Purana]] mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha's wrath was not appeased. The world trembled, fearing what he might do. The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (the gods) requested Shiva to tackle Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as the human-lion-bird Sharabha, with [[Pratyangira]] and Soolini, Shiva's female energies, forming his wings. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and immobilized him by deploying Pratyangira as a weapon. He thus quelled Narasimha's terrifying rage and restored sattva back into him.

After the mutilation, Vishnu assumed his normal form and retired to his abode, after duly praising Shiva. It was from here on that Shiva came to be known as \"Sharabeshamurti\" or \"Simhagnamurti\".<ref name=\"Rao\" /><ref name= Bakker/>\n\nThe [[Skanda Purana]] considers Narasimha as a mere irritation and not a threat to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form.

He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to take the form of Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu requests Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha.

It is best known internationally as the ancestral seat of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] branch of the Saxon [[House of Wettin]], which was renamed the [[House of Windsor]] during their British reign in 1917.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is situated in the valley of the [[Saale]] River north of the [[Thuringian Highland]], {{Convert|48|km|abbr=on}} south of the German cultural centre [[Weimar]]. [[Saalfeld station]] is currently served by [[Intercity-Express]] trains running from [[Berlin]] to [[Munich]].\n\nSaalfeld has 28,000 inhabitants. Together with neighbouring [[Rudolstadt]] and [[Bad Blankenburg]], Saalfeld forms a [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|tri-city]] area with a population of about 70,000.\n\nThe local mountain is the [[Kulm (Saalfeld)|Kulm]], which is 481.9 metres above sea level.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Saalfeld-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|left|Saalfeld, [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], about 1650]]\nSaalfeld is one of the historic towns of Thuringia, possibly founded by the 7th century around a [[Thuringii]] ([[Goths|Gothic]]) fortress today called Hoher Schwarm or ''Sorbenburg'' ([[Sorbs]]' Castle). The area was first mentioned in an 899 deed. Kitzerstein Castle standing on an eminence above the Saale River, was said to have been originally erected by the German King [[Henry the Fowler]], although the present-day building was not built before the 16th century. In 1012 the last [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] ceded the former [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' to Count Palatine [[Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia|Ezzo of Lotharingia]], whose daughter [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] bequested it to the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishops of Cologne]].\n\nAccording to the local chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]], Archbishop [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne|Anno II of Cologne]] in 1071 established a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey here, which quickly became an ecclesiastical centre in eastern Thuringia but was destroyed during the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1526. A [[Franciscan]] monastery was established about 1250, which also was dissolved during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had ordered the layout of an Imperial city, parts of its medieval walls and bastions are preserved up to today. Nevertheless, the citizens in 1208 had to receive [[German town law|town privileges]] from the hands of the [[County of Schwarzburg|Counts of Schwarzburg]] as their feudal lords.\n\n===House of Wettin===\nIn 1389 the town finally was acquired by Landgrave [[Balthasar, Landgrave of Thuringia|Balthasar of Thuringia]], a member of the [[House of Wettin]]. Saalfeld's economy prospered from surrounding [[mining|mines]], transport on the Saale River as well as from fishing (expressed by the [[Barbus barbus|barbel]]s in the town's coat of arms). The Wettin rulers had the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Saint John [[hall church]] erected at the site of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] predecessor building until 1514. The Gothic town hall was completed in 1537. The ruling dynasty reached its height of importance, when in 1423 all Wettin lands including the Thuringian estates were incorporated into the [[Electorate of Saxony]] ([[Upper Saxony]]).\n\nHowever, already in 1485 Elector [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest of Saxony]] agreed on the [[Treaty of Leipzig|Leipzig partition]] with his younger brother Duke [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert III]]. Ernest retained the southern Thuringian estates with Saalfeld; his grandson [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick I]] lost the [[Prince-elector|electoral]] dignity in the 1547 [[Capitulation of Wittenberg]] ending the [[Schmalkaldic War]], along with all his possessions outside of Thuringia. Confirmed by Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] at the [[Diet of Speyer (1570)|1570 Diet of Speyer]], John Frederick's [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] descendants only retained the duchies of [[Saxe-Weimar]] and (from 1572) [[Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach]]. Upon the death of Duke [[Frederick William I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Frederick William I of Saxe-Weimar]] in 1602, Saalfeld passed to the newly established Duchy of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], from 1673 [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]].\n\n===Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld===\n[[File:Schloss saalfeld schlossgartenansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Saalfeld Castle]]\nAfter several blazes in the early 16th century, Saalfeld had been rebuilt in a lavish [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style. In 1675 Duke [[Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg|Albert V of Saxe-Coburg]] upon his accession chose the town as his residence and from 1677 onwards had Saalfeld Castle erected on the site of the destroyed Benedictine abbey, which in 1680 fell to his younger brother [[John Ernest IV, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|John Ernest IV]]. After Albert's death in 1699, John Ernest also claimed [[Saxe-Coburg]] and called himself a duke of [[Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]].\n\nThe Castle, which has been renovated and is today the town administrative building, was home to four generations of the Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld branch. Until 1825, Saalfeld remained one of two capitals of the duchy, together with [[Coburg]], its [[Franconia]]n sister town to the south. The 4th Duke [[Ernest Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Ernest Frederick]] (1724\u20131800) was the last to be born in Saalfeld; in 1764, he moved the capital from Saalfeld to Coburg, where in 1805 his son and heir Duke [[Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Francis]] (1750\u20131806) would buy Rosenau Castle as his residence.\n\nFrancis' children were linked to many of Europe's royal families: His daughter [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1786\u20131861) by her marriage with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]] became the mother of [[Queen Victoria]]. Her brother Duke [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ernest III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1784\u20131844) was the father of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Consort [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]]. This line continues unbroken from Queen Victoria through to Queen [[Elizabeth II]] today. At about the same period, their brother Duke [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1790\u20131865) became the ancestor of the royal [[House of Belgium]] in 1831, while their sister [[Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1781\u20131860) married [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]. Other descendants of Duke Francis include [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], [[Alix of Hesse|Alexandra, Empress consort of Russia]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria, Queen consort of Spain]], [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II, King consort of Portugal]], [[Charlotte of Belgium|Carlota, Empress consort of Mexico]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I, King of Bulgaria]], [[Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain|Sof\u00eda, Queen consort of Spain, Princess of Greece and Denmark]], [[Maud of Wales|Maud, Queen consort of Norway]], and [[Marie of Romania|Marie, Queen consort of Romania]].\n\nDuring the time of Duke Ernest III in 1826, the neighbouring ducal line of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg]] became extinct. Ernest received the former [[Saxe-Gotha]] but in exchange had to give up Saalfeld in favour of his Ernestine cousin Duke [[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Bernhard II of Saxe-Meiningen]].\n\n===Modern times===\nOn 10 October 1806 a united [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] and [[Royal Saxon Army|Saxon]] contingent met with a corps of the French [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] under Marshall [[Jean Lannes]] at the [[Battle of Saalfeld]], whereby [[Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1772\u20131806)|Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia]] was killed. The opening of the Leipzig-Probstzella railway further boosted the town's development. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], Saalfeld became part of the newly established Free State of Thuringia. As a railway junction and garrison town of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' armed forces from 1936, it was strongly affected by [[strategic bombing during World War II]].\n\nUpon the post-war division of Germany, Saalfeld was an [[Inner-German border]] station on the Saal Railway\u2014one of two routes that could be taken by trains between Leipzig/Halle and Nuremberg. As a border station its steam locomotive shed assumed extra importance as Saalfeld essentially became the southern terminus of DDR train services. Due to the continued use of steam locomotives in [[East Germany]] after the end of steam working in [[West Germany]], the area became a mecca for railway enthusiasts for some years. However, despite being very close to the Inner German border to the south, it was only accessible by a very roundabout route.\n\nIn July 2018 the former municipalities of [[Saalfelder H\u00f6he]] and [[Wittgendorf, Thuringia|Wittgendorf]] were merged into Saalfeld. The former municipalities [[Reichmannsdorf]] and [[Schmiedefeld (Lichtetal)|Schmiedefeld]] were merged into Saalfeld in January 2019.\n\n==Economy==\nTraditionally, Saalfeld was known for its [[silver mining|silver mines]].

It is best known internationally as the ancestral seat of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] branch of the Saxon [[House of Wettin]], which was renamed the [[House of Windsor]] during their British reign in 1917.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is situated in the valley of the [[Saale]] River north of the [[Thuringian Highland]], {{Convert|48|km|abbr=on}} south of the German cultural centre [[Weimar]]. [[Saalfeld station]] is currently served by [[Intercity-Express]] trains running from [[Berlin]] to [[Munich]].\n\nSaalfeld has 28,000 inhabitants. Together with neighbouring [[Rudolstadt]] and [[Bad Blankenburg]], Saalfeld forms a [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|tri-city]] area with a population of about 70,000.\n\nThe local mountain is the [[Kulm (Saalfeld)|Kulm]], which is 481.9 metres above sea level.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Saalfeld-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|left|Saalfeld, [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], about 1650]]\nSaalfeld is one of the historic towns of Thuringia, possibly founded by the 7th century around a [[Thuringii]] ([[Goths|Gothic]]) fortress today called Hoher Schwarm or ''Sorbenburg'' ([[Sorbs]]' Castle). The area was first mentioned in an 899 deed. Kitzerstein Castle standing on an eminence above the Saale River, was said to have been originally erected by the German King [[Henry the Fowler]], although the present-day building was not built before the 16th century. In 1012 the last [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] ceded the former [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' to Count Palatine [[Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia|Ezzo of Lotharingia]], whose daughter [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] bequested it to the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishops of Cologne]].\n\nAccording to the local chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]], Archbishop [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne|Anno II of Cologne]] in 1071 established a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey here, which quickly became an ecclesiastical centre in eastern Thuringia but was destroyed during the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1526. A [[Franciscan]] monastery was established about 1250, which also was dissolved during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had ordered the layout of an Imperial city, parts of its medieval walls and bastions are preserved up to today. Nevertheless, the citizens in 1208 had to receive [[German town law|town privileges]] from the hands of the [[County of Schwarzburg|Counts of Schwarzburg]] as their feudal lords.\n\n===House of Wettin===\nIn 1389 the town finally was acquired by Landgrave [[Balthasar, Landgrave of Thuringia|Balthasar of Thuringia]], a member of the [[House of Wettin]]. Saalfeld's economy prospered from surrounding [[mining|mines]], transport on the Saale River as well as from fishing (expressed by the [[Barbus barbus|barbel]]s in the town's coat of arms). The Wettin rulers had the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Saint John [[hall church]] erected at the site of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] predecessor building until 1514. The Gothic town hall was completed in 1537. The ruling dynasty reached its height of importance, when in 1423 all Wettin lands including the Thuringian estates were incorporated into the [[Electorate of Saxony]] ([[Upper Saxony]]).\n\nHowever, already in 1485 Elector [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest of Saxony]] agreed on the [[Treaty of Leipzig|Leipzig partition]] with his younger brother Duke [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert III]]. Ernest retained the southern Thuringian estates with Saalfeld; his grandson [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick I]] lost the [[Prince-elector|electoral]] dignity in the 1547 [[Capitulation of Wittenberg]] ending the [[Schmalkaldic War]], along with all his possessions outside of Thuringia. Confirmed by Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] at the [[Diet of Speyer (1570)|1570 Diet of Speyer]], John Frederick's [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] descendants only retained the duchies of [[Saxe-Weimar]] and (from 1572) [[Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach]]. Upon the death of Duke [[Frederick William I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Frederick William I of Saxe-Weimar]] in 1602, Saalfeld passed to the newly established Duchy of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], from 1673 [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]].\n\n===Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld===\n[[File:Schloss saalfeld schlossgartenansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Saalfeld Castle]]\nAfter several blazes in the early 16th century, Saalfeld had been rebuilt in a lavish [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style. In 1675 Duke [[Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg|Albert V of Saxe-Coburg]] upon his accession chose the town as his residence and from 1677 onwards had Saalfeld Castle erected on the site of the destroyed Benedictine abbey, which in 1680 fell to his younger brother [[John Ernest IV, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|John Ernest IV]]. After Albert's death in 1699, John Ernest also claimed [[Saxe-Coburg]] and called himself a duke of [[Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]].\n\nThe Castle, which has been renovated and is today the town administrative building, was home to four generations of the Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld branch. Until 1825, Saalfeld remained one of two capitals of the duchy, together with [[Coburg]], its [[Franconia]]n sister town to the south. The 4th Duke [[Ernest Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Ernest Frederick]] (1724\u20131800) was the last to be born in Saalfeld; in 1764, he moved the capital from Saalfeld to Coburg, where in 1805 his son and heir Duke [[Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Francis]] (1750\u20131806) would buy Rosenau Castle as his residence.\n\nFrancis' children were linked to many of Europe's royal families: His daughter [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1786\u20131861) by her marriage with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]] became the mother of [[Queen Victoria]]. Her brother Duke [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ernest III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1784\u20131844) was the father of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Consort [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]]. This line continues unbroken from Queen Victoria through to Queen [[Elizabeth II]] today. At about the same period, their brother Duke [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1790\u20131865) became the ancestor of the royal [[House of Belgium]] in 1831, while their sister [[Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (1781\u20131860) married [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]. Other descendants of Duke Francis include [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], [[Alix of Hesse|Alexandra, Empress consort of Russia]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria, Queen consort of Spain]], [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II, King consort of Portugal]], [[Charlotte of Belgium|Carlota, Empress consort of Mexico]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I, King of Bulgaria]], [[Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain|Sof\u00eda, Queen consort of Spain, Princess of Greece and Denmark]], [[Maud of Wales|Maud, Queen consort of Norway]], and [[Marie of Romania|Marie, Queen consort of Romania]].\n\nDuring the time of Duke Ernest III in 1826, the neighbouring ducal line of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg]] became extinct. Ernest received the former [[Saxe-Gotha]] but in exchange had to give up Saalfeld in favour of his Ernestine cousin Duke [[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Bernhard II of Saxe-Meiningen]].\n\n===Modern times===\nOn 10 October 1806 a united [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] and [[Royal Saxon Army|Saxon]] contingent met with a corps of the French [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] under Marshall [[Jean Lannes]] at the [[Battle of Saalfeld]], whereby [[Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1772\u20131806)|Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia]] was killed. The opening of the Leipzig-Probstzella railway further boosted the town's development. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], Saalfeld became part of the newly established Free State of Thuringia. As a railway junction and garrison town of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' armed forces from 1936, it was strongly affected by [[strategic bombing during World War II]].\n\nUpon the post-war division of Germany, Saalfeld was an [[Inner-German border]] station on the Saal Railway\u2014one of two routes that could be taken by trains between Leipzig/Halle and Nuremberg. As a border station its steam locomotive shed assumed extra importance as Saalfeld essentially became the southern terminus of DDR train services. Due to the continued use of steam locomotives in [[East Germany]] after the end of steam working in [[West Germany]], the area became a mecca for railway enthusiasts for some years. However, despite being very close to the Inner German border to the south, it was only accessible by a very roundabout route.\n\nIn July 2018 the former municipalities of [[Saalfelder H\u00f6he]] and [[Wittgendorf, Thuringia|Wittgendorf]] were merged into Saalfeld. The former municipalities [[Reichmannsdorf]] and [[Schmiedefeld (Lichtetal)|Schmiedefeld]] were merged into Saalfeld in January 2019.\n\n==Economy==\nTraditionally, Saalfeld was known for its [[silver mining|silver mines]]. Today, Saalfeld has a number of prosperous [[industry|industries]], including the manufacture of [[machinery]], [[brick]]s, [[paint]], [[malt]], [[cigar]]s, [[hosiery]], [[chocolate]] and [[vinegar]]. Other industries are [[brewing]], [[printing]] and iron-founding, and there are [[ochre]] and [[iron]] mines in the area.\n\nTourism and recreation-related activities make up a significant part of the local economy.<ref>[http://www.thueringen-tourismus.de/cps/rde/xchg/thuringia-tourism/hs.xsl/index.html]</ref> Saalfeld is located in the mountainous forests of Thuringia, a province well known for its winter sports, supplying half of the gold medals for overall medal table winner Germany in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics.<ref>http://www.leg-thueringen.de/index.php?id=1982&L=1{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSaalfeld is a popular base for hikers taking on the mountainous 168&nbsp;km [[Rennsteig]] ridge, Germany's legendary hiking trail and other nearby outdoor options including hiking, skiing, fishing, hunting, rock climbing, sailing and many other sports.<ref>[http://www.germany-tourism.de/ENG/destination_germany/master_tlbundesland-id25-fbundesland_natur.htm]</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Johann Philipp Kirnberger.jpg|thumb|150px|Johann Kirnberger]]\n*[[Erasmus Reinhold]], (1511-1553), mathematician and the most influential astronomer in 16th-century Germany\n*[[Johann Semler]], (1725-1791), 18th-century theologian and father of German rationalism\n*[[Johann Kirnberger]], (1721-1783), 18th-century composer and royal music director, student of Bach\n*[[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], (1852-1929), professor of linguistic and noted Sanskrit scholar\n*[[Paul O\u00dfwald]], (1905-1993), football manager of Eintracht Frankfurt, German champion 1959\n*[[Ror Wolf]] (1932-2020), artist, writer and poet\n*[[Britta Bilac]], (born 1968), high jumper.
