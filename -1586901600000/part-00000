The party was originally formed in 1992 by the merger of [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]], [[Mapam]] and [[Shinui]], and was at its peak between 1992 and 1996 when it had 12 seats. It is currently has three seats in the Knesset.\n\nMeretz is a secular party emphasising a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], social justice, human rights (especially for religious, ethnic and sexual minorities), religious freedom and environmentalism.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3499193,00.html |title=Meretz |date=4 February 2008 |publisher=Ynetnews |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> The party is a member of the [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Socialist International]], and is an observer member of the [[Party of European Socialists]].\n\n==History==\nMeretz was formed prior to the [[1992 Israeli legislative election]] by an alliance of three [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] political parties, [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]], [[Mapam]] and [[Shinui]], and was initially led by Ratz's chairwoman and long-time [[Knesset]] member [[Shulamit Aloni]]. The name \"Meretz\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e8\u05e6}}) was chosen as an [[Acronym and initialism#In Hebrew|acronym]] for Mapam ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e4\"\u05dd}}) and Ratz ({{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05e6}}). The third party of the alliance wasn't reflected in its name, but was instead mentioned in the party's campaign slogan: \"{{Hebrew|\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd '''\u05de\u05e8\u05e6''', \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05d7 \u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4'''\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9'''}}\" (''A government with '''vigor''' ''[Meretz]'', the strength to make the '''change''''' [Shinui]). Its first electoral test was a success, with the party winning twelve seats, making it the third-largest in the Knesset. Meretz became the major coalition partner of [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]], helping pave the way for the [[Oslo Accords]]. The party also picked up several ministerial portfolios; Aloni was made Minister of Education, though disputes over the role of religion in education meant she was moved out of the education ministry to become [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in May 1993.{{citation needed|reason=need citation for reason behind ministerial portfolio change|date=June 2016}} In June 1993, she became [[Ministry of Communications (Israel)|Minister of Communications]] and [[Science and Technology Minister of Israel|Minister of Science and Technology]], a role that was later renamed Minister of Science and the Arts. [[Amnon Rubinstein]] became Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology, and later [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Minister of Education, Culture and Sport]], whilst [[Yossi Sarid]] was named Minister of the Environment and [[Yair Tzaban]] was named [[Ministry of Immigrant Absorption|Minister of Immigrant Absorption]].\n\nAfter the [[1996 Israeli general election|1996 elections]], in which Meretz lost a quarter of its seats, Aloni lost internal leadership elections to Yossi Sarid and retired. In 1997, the three parties officially merged into a single entity, though part of Shinui (under the leadership of [[Avraham Poraz]]) broke away to form a separate movement. Later in the Knesset session, [[David Zucker (politician)|David Zucker]] also left the party to sit as an independent MK.\n\n===1999\u20132009===\nThe [[1999 Israeli general election|1999 elections]] saw the party regain some of its former strength, picking up 10 seats, including the first-ever female [[Arab members of the Knesset|Israeli Arab MK]], [[Hussniya Jabara]]. Meretz were invited into [[Ehud Barak]]'s coalition, with Sarid becoming Education Minister, [[Ran Cohen]] [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Minister of Industry and Trade]] and [[Haim Oron]] [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Israel)|Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development]]. However, after [[Likud]] leader [[Ariel Sharon]] beat Barak in a special [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Ministerial election in 2001]], Meretz left the government.\n\nOn 22 October 2002, Meretz MK [[Uzi Even]] made history by becoming the first openly [[Homosexuality|gay]] Member of Knesset, after Amnon Rubinstein retired. This created a vacancy and Even was next on the Meretz list. His term lasted less than three months, however, as the Knesset was dissolved in January 2003. Even's entry to the Knesset was met by mixed reactions from the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] parties; [[Shas]]'s [[Nissim Ze'ev]] was the harshest, saying Even \"symbolized the bestialization of humanity\", adding that he should be \"hidden under the carpet\" and banned from entering the Knesset.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/18616/openly-gay-knesset-member-ripples-the-establishment/ |title=Openly Gay Knesset Member Ripples the Establishment |newspaper=[[j. (newspaper)|Northern California Jewish Bulletin]] |date=11 October 2002 |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]], Meretz were joined by [[Roman Bronfman]]'s [[Democratic Choice (Israel)|Democratic Choice]]. However, the party shrank in representation again, this time to just six seats. Sarid immediately took responsibility and resigned from leadership, though he did not retire from the Knesset and continued serving as an MK, before stepping down prior to the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|2006 elections]].\n\nIn December 2003, Meretz was disbanded, in order to merge with [[Yossi Beilin]]'s non-parliamentary Shahar ({{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05d7\"\u05e8}}) movement. The original name suggested for the new party was ''Ya'ad'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''Goal''), but was not used because it sounded like the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for poison (\"yad\"), and it was feared that it might alienate Israel's one million Russian-speaking voters (although there had been two parties previously in Israel using the name \u2013 [[Ya'ad (political party)|Ya'ad]] and [[Ya'ad \u2013 Civil Rights Movement]], the latter ironically a forerunner of Meretz, they both existed before large-scale immigration from the Soviet Union). Instead, the name ''Yachad'' (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d7\"\u05d3) was chosen. As well as meaning \"Together\", it is also a Hebrew acronym for ''Social-Democratic Israel'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05ea}}, ''Yisrael Hevratit Demokratit'').\n\nThe new party was established in order to unite and resuscitate the Israeli Zionist peace camp, which had been soundly defeated in the 2003 elections (dropping from 56 Knesset members in 1992 to 24 in 2003) following the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The party's purpose was to unite a variety of dovish Zionist movements with the dovish wing of the Labor Party. However, the efforts were largely unsuccessful as, except for the original Meretz, Shahar and Democratic Choice, no other movement joined the new party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It has suffered from declining popular interest in left-wing peace movements, as a result of the rise in Palestinian violence, and only 20,000 people are now registered members of the party, half the number who were prior to the 1999 party primaries.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn March 2004, Yossi Beilin was elected party leader, beating Ran Cohen, and started a two-year term as the first chairman of Yachad. In July 2005, the party decided to change its name to Meretz-Yachad, because opinion polls revealed that the name ''Yachad'' was not recognisable to the Israeli public and that they preferred the old name ''Meretz''. The chairman Beilin opposed the motion to revert the name to Meretz and a compromise between the old and new names, ''Meretz-Yachad'', was agreed upon.\n\nHowever, in the 2006 election campaign, the party dropped the ''Yachad'' part of its name, running as just ''Meretz'', under the slogan \"Meretz on the left, the Human in the centre\". Nevertheless, it failed to stop the party's decline, as they won just five seats. In 2007, [[Tsvia Greenfeld]], sixth on the party list, became the first-ever female [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] Knesset member, following Yossi Beilin's decision to retire from politics.\n\nIn March 2008, internal elections for the chairman of the party were held. At an early stage, Yossi Beilin, [[Zehava Gal-On]] and Ran Cohen announced their bids. After Haim Oron announced his bid in December 2007, Beilin withdrew his bid and announced his support for him. Oron went on to win the internal elections held on 18 March 2008 with 54.5% of the vote, beating Ran Cohen (27.1%) and Zehava Gal-On (18.1%) to become Meretz's new chairman.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3520884,00.html |title=MK Oron voted new Meretz chairman |last=Somfalvi |first=Attila |date=19 March 2008 |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 2008, Meretz finalized its merger with Hatnua HaHadasha (\"The New Movement\") for the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 Israeli elections]].<ref name=senyor>{{Cite news | last = Senyor | first = Eli | title = Meretz finalizes union with new leftist movement | publisher = Ynetnews | date = 22 December 2008 | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3642742,00.html | accessdate = 23 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===2009\u2013present===\n[[File:Rabin Square 011114 03.jpg|thumbnail|Meretz balloon flying at the Rabin memorial rally in [[Rabin Square]], 1 November 2014]]\nThe joint Meretz\u2013Hatnua HaHadasha list ended up winning only 3 seats in the election.

The name \"Meretz\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e8\u05e6}}) was chosen as an [[Acronym and initialism#In Hebrew|acronym]] for Mapam ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e4\"\u05dd}}) and Ratz ({{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05e6}}). The third party of the alliance wasn't reflected in its name, but was instead mentioned in the party's campaign slogan: \"{{Hebrew|\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd '''\u05de\u05e8\u05e6''', \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05d7 \u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4'''\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9'''}}\" (''A government with '''vigor''' ''[Meretz]'', the strength to make the '''change''''' [Shinui]). Its first electoral test was a success, with the party winning twelve seats, making it the third-largest in the Knesset. Meretz became the major coalition partner of [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]], helping pave the way for the [[Oslo Accords]]. The party also picked up several ministerial portfolios; Aloni was made Minister of Education, though disputes over the role of religion in education meant she was moved out of the education ministry to become [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in May 1993.{{citation needed|reason=need citation for reason behind ministerial portfolio change|date=June 2016}} In June 1993, she became [[Ministry of Communications (Israel)|Minister of Communications]] and [[Science and Technology Minister of Israel|Minister of Science and Technology]], a role that was later renamed Minister of Science and the Arts. [[Amnon Rubinstein]] became Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology, and later [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Minister of Education, Culture and Sport]], whilst [[Yossi Sarid]] was named Minister of the Environment and [[Yair Tzaban]] was named [[Ministry of Immigrant Absorption|Minister of Immigrant Absorption]].\n\nAfter the [[1996 Israeli general election|1996 elections]], in which Meretz lost a quarter of its seats, Aloni lost internal leadership elections to Yossi Sarid and retired. In 1997, the three parties officially merged into a single entity, though part of Shinui (under the leadership of [[Avraham Poraz]]) broke away to form a separate movement. Later in the Knesset session, [[David Zucker (politician)|David Zucker]] also left the party to sit as an independent MK.\n\n===1999\u20132009===\nThe [[1999 Israeli general election|1999 elections]] saw the party regain some of its former strength, picking up 10 seats, including the first-ever female [[Arab members of the Knesset|Israeli Arab MK]], [[Hussniya Jabara]]. Meretz were invited into [[Ehud Barak]]'s coalition, with Sarid becoming Education Minister, [[Ran Cohen]] [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Minister of Industry and Trade]] and [[Haim Oron]] [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Israel)|Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development]]. However, after [[Likud]] leader [[Ariel Sharon]] beat Barak in a special [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Ministerial election in 2001]], Meretz left the government.\n\nOn 22 October 2002, Meretz MK [[Uzi Even]] made history by becoming the first openly [[Homosexuality|gay]] Member of Knesset, after Amnon Rubinstein retired. This created a vacancy and Even was next on the Meretz list. His term lasted less than three months, however, as the Knesset was dissolved in January 2003. Even's entry to the Knesset was met by mixed reactions from the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] parties; [[Shas]]'s [[Nissim Ze'ev]] was the harshest, saying Even \"symbolized the bestialization of humanity\", adding that he should be \"hidden under the carpet\" and banned from entering the Knesset.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/18616/openly-gay-knesset-member-ripples-the-establishment/ |title=Openly Gay Knesset Member Ripples the Establishment |newspaper=[[j.

However, the party shrank in representation again, this time to just six seats. Sarid immediately took responsibility and resigned from leadership, though he did not retire from the Knesset and continued serving as an MK, before stepping down prior to the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|2006 elections]].\n\nIn December 2003, Meretz was disbanded, in order to merge with [[Yossi Beilin]]'s non-parliamentary Shahar ({{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05d7\"\u05e8}}) movement. The original name suggested for the new party was ''Ya'ad'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05e2\u05d3}}, ''Goal''), but was not used because it sounded like the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for poison (\"yad\"), and it was feared that it might alienate Israel's one million Russian-speaking voters (although there had been two parties previously in Israel using the name \u2013 [[Ya'ad (political party)|Ya'ad]] and [[Ya'ad \u2013 Civil Rights Movement]], the latter ironically a forerunner of Meretz, they both existed before large-scale immigration from the Soviet Union). Instead, the name ''Yachad'' (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d7\"\u05d3) was chosen. As well as meaning \"Together\", it is also a Hebrew acronym for ''Social-Democratic Israel'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05ea}}, ''Yisrael Hevratit Demokratit'').\n\nThe new party was established in order to unite and resuscitate the Israeli Zionist peace camp, which had been soundly defeated in the 2003 elections (dropping from 56 Knesset members in 1992 to 24 in 2003) following the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The party's purpose was to unite a variety of dovish Zionist movements with the dovish wing of the Labor Party. However, the efforts were largely unsuccessful as, except for the original Meretz, Shahar and Democratic Choice, no other movement joined the new party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It has suffered from declining popular interest in left-wing peace movements, as a result of the rise in Palestinian violence, and only 20,000 people are now registered members of the party, half the number who were prior to the 1999 party primaries.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn March 2004, Yossi Beilin was elected party leader, beating Ran Cohen, and started a two-year term as the first chairman of Yachad. In July 2005, the party decided to change its name to Meretz-Yachad, because opinion polls revealed that the name ''Yachad'' was not recognisable to the Israeli public and that they preferred the old name ''Meretz''. The chairman Beilin opposed the motion to revert the name to Meretz and a compromise between the old and new names, ''Meretz-Yachad'', was agreed upon.\n\nHowever, in the 2006 election campaign, the party dropped the ''Yachad'' part of its name, running as just ''Meretz'', under the slogan \"Meretz on the left, the Human in the centre\". Nevertheless, it failed to stop the party's decline, as they won just five seats. In 2007, [[Tsvia Greenfeld]], sixth on the party list, became the first-ever female [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] Knesset member, following Yossi Beilin's decision to retire from politics.\n\nIn March 2008, internal elections for the chairman of the party were held. At an early stage, Yossi Beilin, [[Zehava Gal-On]] and Ran Cohen announced their bids. After Haim Oron announced his bid in December 2007, Beilin withdrew his bid and announced his support for him. Oron went on to win the internal elections held on 18 March 2008 with 54.5% of the vote, beating Ran Cohen (27.1%) and Zehava Gal-On (18.1%) to become Meretz's new chairman.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3520884,00.html |title=MK Oron voted new Meretz chairman |last=Somfalvi |first=Attila |date=19 March 2008 |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 2008, Meretz finalized its merger with Hatnua HaHadasha (\"The New Movement\") for the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 Israeli elections]].<ref name=senyor>{{Cite news | last = Senyor | first = Eli | title = Meretz finalizes union with new leftist movement | publisher = Ynetnews | date = 22 December 2008 | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3642742,00.html | accessdate = 23 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===2009\u2013present===\n[[File:Rabin Square 011114 03.jpg|thumbnail|Meretz balloon flying at the Rabin memorial rally in [[Rabin Square]], 1 November 2014]]\nThe joint Meretz\u2013Hatnua HaHadasha list ended up winning only 3 seats in the election.

It is most closely associated with styles such as [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu]] and [[Bak Mei]].\n\nDespite its name, the Southern Mantis style is unrelated to the [[Northern Praying Mantis]] style.<ref>Jon Funk, [http://www.mantiskungfu.com/praying_mantis_kung_fu_complete_system.php Praying mantis Kung fu: the complete system] mantiskungfu.com</ref>\n\nSouthern Praying Mantis places a heavy emphasis on close-range fighting. This system is known for its short power methods, and has aspects of both internal and external techniques. In application, the emphasis is on hand and arm techniques, and a limited use of low kicks. The application of close combat methods with an emphasis on hands and short kicking techniques makes the Southern Praying Mantis art somewhat akin to what many would call \"street fighting.\" The hands are the most readily available for attack and defence of the upper body, and protect the stylist by employing ruthless techniques designed to inflict serious injury. The legs are moved quickly into range through footwork to protect and defend the body, and kicks are kept low, short and quick so as to never leave the Southern Mantis combatant off balance and vulnerable.\n\n== History ==\nThere are five main branches of Southern Praying Mantis:\n\n* [[Chow Gar]] (\u5468\u5bb6; Chow family)\n* Chu Gar (\u6731\u5bb6; Chu family)\n* Kwong Sai Jook Lum ({{zh|t=\u6c5f\u897f\u7af9\u6797|p=Ji\u0101ngx\u012b zh\u00fal\u00edn}} \"[[Jiangxi|Ji\u0101ngx\u012b]] Bamboo Forest\")\n* Iron Ox ({{zh|t=\u9435\u725b|p=Ti\u011b ni\u00fa}})\n* K.

However, despite similarities, the genealogies of these branches are not complete enough to trace them to a single common ancestor.

Those styles can be identified as being Hakka Kuen.\n\n=== Hakka Kuen ===\nKwong Sai Jook Lum tradition mentions that the people of the Pearl River Delta once referred to the Southern Praying Mantis style as \"Hakka Kuen\" ({{zh|t=\u5ba2\u5bb6\u62f3|p=K\u00e8ji\u0101 qu\u00e1n}} \"Hakka Fist\"), a term that was initially linked to the Southern martial arts practised by the Hakka community of inland eastern [[Guangdong]] and later applied to the skills that are practised by oversea Hakka communities. The reason for this was the close association of this style with the Hakka community.\n\nThis region, the original home to Southern Praying Mantis by way of being the childhood hometowns of its deemed founders, covers a wide expanse in Southern China. It begins at the very heart of Hakka territory at [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]], the home of Chow Gar founder Chow Ah-Nam. From Xingning, the [[Dong River (China)|Dong River]] (\u6771\u6c5f) flows west out of [[Meizhou]] (\u6885\u5dde) through [[Hoh Yuen]], the place of origin for Iron Ox founder Choi Tit-Ngau. In the prefecture of [[Huizhou]], the Dong Kwong forms the northern border of Hu\u00ecy\u00e1ng (\u60e0\u967d) County, where Kwong Sai Jook Lum master Chung Yu-Chang and Chow/Chu Gar teacher Lau Shui grew up and established their martial arts reputation. From there, the Dongjiang flows into the [[Pearl River Delta]] (\u73e0\u6c5f\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32) at [[Bao'an County]] (present-day [[Shenzhen]]), where Kwong Sai Jook Lum masters Wong Yook-Gong and Lum Wing-Fay originated. These masters are all members of the Hakka community and the transmission of this remained within this community until the generation of Lau Shui and Lum Wing-Fay.\n\n=== Praying Mantis ===\nThe association of the term \"(Praying) Mantis\" with the style is also controversial. Each branch of the style offers a different explanation.\n\nThe traditions of the Chow Gar and Kwong Sai Jook Lum branches each maintain that their respective founders Chow Ah-Nam and Som Dot created their styles after witnessing a praying mantis fight and defeat a bird. Such inspiration is a recurring motif in the Chinese martial arts and can be found in the legends of Northern Praying Mantis, [[Fujian White Crane]], [[Tai chi]] and [[Wing Chun]].\n\nThe traditions of the Chu family branch contend that the name \"Southern Praying Mantis\" was chosen to conceal from Qing forces its political affiliations by pretending that this esoteric style of Ming loyalists was in fact a regional variant of the popular and widespread Northern Mantis style from [[Shandong]].<ref name=gene/>\n\nThe use of the term \"Praying Mantis\" seems appropriate when one considers the postures of well known practitioners of this style.  The emphasis on the techniques of sticky hands, the use of the forearm with the elbows tucked into the chest, claw like fingers and quick explosive actions creates an image that are visually similar to a praying mantis preparing to strike its prey.<ref name=\"Hagood2\">\n{{cite web | author = Roger D.

The legacy of Lau Soei that is related to the praying mantis name was his famous staff form - the Tong Long Bo Sim Staff ({{zh|t=\u87b3\u8782\u6355\u87ec\u68cd}}).\n\n=== Lau Soei ===\nLau Soei (1866\u20131942; \u5289\u745e; \u5289\u6c34\ufe5e) was a Hakka who established a reputation as a martial artist during the turn of the century in Southern China and later as a martial arts teacher in Hong Kong.<ref>\n{{cite web | title = Hong Kong Martial Arts Masters (\u9999\u6e2f\u6b66\u6797\u540d\u5e2b) | publisher = Hong Kong Wushu & Art Service Centre | url = http://wushuart.com.hk/museum/museum.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-23 }}</ref>\nLau Soei  was also known as the tiger of Dong Jiang (\u6771\u6c5f\u8001\u864e). His signature techniques include the \"Zhoujia (Chow Gar)-Tanglang-Sanjian\" (the three arrows of Zhoujia praying mantis, \u5468\u5bb6\u87b3\u8782\u4e09\u7bad\u62f3) and the staff form \u201cTanglang-puchangun\u201d (\u87b3\u8782\u6355\u87ec\u68cd\u5c24). Like many martial artists of his generation, he resettled in Hong Kong after the [[Chinese Civil War]]. He continued to teach the Southern Praying Mantis Style and many of his students eventually became teachers of this style. He was acknowledged by both the Chow Gar and the Chu Gar practitioners as the founding teacher of the system in the modern era.\n\n=== Chow Gar ===\nThe most famous branch of Southern Mantis martial arts, the Chow family (\u5468\u5bb6) branch traces its art to c. 1800 to Chow Ah-Nam (\u5468\u4e9e\u5357), a Hakka who as a boy left his home in [[Guangdong]] for medical treatment at the Southern [[Shaolin Monastery]] in [[Fujian]] where, in addition to being treated for his stomach ailment, he was trained in the martial arts and eventually created Southern Praying Mantis. His student was Wong Fook Go (\u9ec3\u798f\u9ad8) who was one of the teacher of Lau Soei.<ref name=CCMA/>\n\nThe continued popularity of modern Chow Gar is due to the work of [[Chow Gar#Chow Gar#Yip Shui (1912-2004)|Ip Shui]] (\u8449\u745e), a student of Lau Soei. He promoted the style within Hong Kong and later, to the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name=\"Whitrod\">\n{{cite web | title = Abridged History of Southern Praying Mantis | publisher = Chow Gar Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu (UK) | url = http://www.chowgarsouthernmantis.com | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-20 }}</ref>  and Australia.<ref name=\"Chow's Family Praying Mantis Kung Fu Association\">\n{{cite web | title = Chow's Family Praying Mantis Kung Fu Association | url = http://www.prayingmantiskungfu.com.au | access-date = 2010-04-09 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121231013327/http://www.prayingmantiskungfu.com.au/ | archive-date = 2012-12-31 | df =  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Brennan\">\n{{cite web | title = Chow Gar Tong Long, Brisbane, Australia\n | url = http://www.chowgar.com.au | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Chu Gar / Chuka / Chu Ka ===\nThe Chu family (\u6731\u5bb6) branch attributes its art to  Chu Fook-To, who created Southern Praying Mantis as a fighting style for opponents of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644&ndash;1912), a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] dynasty that overthrew the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] royal family (1368&ndash;1644), who were [[Han Chinese]]. This is the oldest branch in terms of origin and is the probable origin of the Southern Mantis style by way of age from which the other branches derived from. According to the Chu family branch, Chu was a member of the Ming Royal family who took refuge at  Shaolin Monastery in [[Henan]].  After the destruction of the Northern Shaolin Monastery, Chu escaped to the Southern Shaolin Monastery in [[Fujian]]. He then promoted his art in the surrounding regions.\n\nCurrent students of Chu Gar are not related to the students of Lau Soei. Lau Soei was friends with the a member of the Chu family. Chu's son, who had learned Chu Gar all his life, was sent to Lau Soei to learn Chow Gar. At a Demonstration a reporter asked Chu's son what style of kung fu he did and he replied \"Chu Gar\". Then the reporter asked him \"Who is your master?\" and because at the time he was training under Lau Soei he said Lau Soei was his master, the reporter misunderstood and thought Lau Soei taught Chu Gar. This is the story told by grandmaster Ng Si Kay, Son in law of Ip Shui, who has been the records keeper of Ip Shui's School for approximately 50 Years and is the current head of the Chow Gar Mantis Association in Hong Kong.\n\nCurrent students of Chuka are related to the students of Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong. Those students, Sigungs Tony Blum Jr, Eddie Chin and Manuel Rodriguez continue the tradition of his school. Sigung Tony Blum Jr. took over teaching of the System in 1995 in the Chicagoland area as appointed by Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong. He was then turned over the legacy and heritage in the United States by Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong before his passing in 2007. Sigung Manuel Rodriguez also continues teaching in Ventura, California area. Chuka can be found in China and the United States.\n\n=== Kwong Sai Jook Lum ===\nAccording to oral traditions, the Kwong Sai Jook Lum (\u6c5f\u897f\u7af9\u6797) style traces its origins to the temple Jook Lum Gee (\u7af9\u6797\u5bfa; Bamboo Forest Temple), [[Mount Wutai|Wu Tai Shan]] (\u4e94\u53f0\u5c71) in [[Shanxi]] province and on [[Mount Longhu|Mt. Longhu]] (\u9f8d\u864e\u5c71) in [[Jiangxi]] (\u6c5f\u897f) province. The monk Som Dot (\u4e09\u9054\u7956\u5e2b), created this new martial art system in the late 18th to early 19th century. He passed the art on to Lee Kun Ching (\u674e\u5b98\u6e05), later known as Lee Siem See (\u674e\u79aa\u5e2b); a name that can be translated as \"Zen master Lee\"). Lee Siem See would travel to Southern China and spread the art amongst the general population. In Guangdong, his student, Cheung Yiu Chung (\u5f35\u8000\u5b97), would later return with him to Kwong Sai (Jiangxi) Province to complete his training at Jook Lum Gee.\n\nIn 1919, Cheung returned to reside in Wei Yang Xian (Wei Yang County) Dan Shui in Guangdong Province.  During the winter of 1929, Cheung opened his first martial arts school and a [[traditional Chinese medicine]] clinic in Bao'an County in P\u00edngsh\u0101n (\u576a\u5c71) Town and continued to promote the Jook Lum system.  Wong Yook-Kong (\u9ec3(\u516c)\u6bd3\u5149), Lum Wing-Fay (\u6797\u69ae\u8f1d; 1910\u20131992; also known as Lum Sang, \u6797\u751f; Lum Sang can be translated as Mr. Lum) and Lee Wing Sing (\u674e\u814e\u52dd) are some of his students from that period.\n\nLee Wing Sing (\u674e\u814e\u52dd) originally trained in Chu Gar before becoming a student of Cheung Yiu Chung. He then continued his training at the Jook Lum Gee, learning a variant of Bamboo Forest Temple Praying Mantis that was somewhat different from (although related to) the art he learned under Cheung Yiu Chung. The lineage of Lee Wing Sing is continued by his family and disciples in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCheung eventually moved to Hong Kong.  He opened a martial arts studio and became the head teacher to the Hong Kong Hakka ship and dock workers union. The classes in Hong Kong was taught by Wong Yook-Kong<ref name=\"1992LeeWhite\">\n{{cite web|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/magazine/article.php?article=178|title=Secrets of Southern Praying Mantis - Henry Poo Yee's story|author1=Henry Lee|first=|author2=Harry A.

It is most closely associated with styles such as [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu]] and [[Bak Mei]].\n\nDespite its name, the Southern Mantis style is unrelated to the [[Northern Praying Mantis]] style.<ref>Jon Funk, [http://www.mantiskungfu.com/praying_mantis_kung_fu_complete_system.php Praying mantis Kung fu: the complete system] mantiskungfu.com</ref>\n\nSouthern Praying Mantis places a heavy emphasis on close-range fighting. This system is known for its short power methods, and has aspects of both internal and external techniques. In application, the emphasis is on hand and arm techniques, and a limited use of low kicks. The application of close combat methods with an emphasis on hands and short kicking techniques makes the Southern Praying Mantis art somewhat akin to what many would call \"street fighting.\" The hands are the most readily available for attack and defence of the upper body, and protect the stylist by employing ruthless techniques designed to inflict serious injury. The legs are moved quickly into range through footwork to protect and defend the body, and kicks are kept low, short and quick so as to never leave the Southern Mantis combatant off balance and vulnerable.\n\n== History ==\nThere are five main branches of Southern Praying Mantis:\n\n* [[Chow Gar]] (\u5468\u5bb6; Chow family)\n* Chu Gar (\u6731\u5bb6; Chu family)\n* Kwong Sai Jook Lum ({{zh|t=\u6c5f\u897f\u7af9\u6797|p=Ji\u0101ngx\u012b zh\u00fal\u00edn}} \"[[Jiangxi|Ji\u0101ngx\u012b]] Bamboo Forest\")\n* Iron Ox ({{zh|t=\u9435\u725b|p=Ti\u011b ni\u00fa}})\n* K.

Those styles can be identified as being Hakka Kuen.\n\n=== Hakka Kuen ===\nKwong Sai Jook Lum tradition mentions that the people of the Pearl River Delta once referred to the Southern Praying Mantis style as \"Hakka Kuen\" ({{zh|t=\u5ba2\u5bb6\u62f3|p=K\u00e8ji\u0101 qu\u00e1n}} \"Hakka Fist\"), a term that was initially linked to the Southern martial arts practised by the Hakka community of inland eastern [[Guangdong]] and later applied to the skills that are practised by oversea Hakka communities. The reason for this was the close association of this style with the Hakka community.\n\nThis region, the original home to Southern Praying Mantis by way of being the childhood hometowns of its deemed founders, covers a wide expanse in Southern China. It begins at the very heart of Hakka territory at [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]], the home of Chow Gar founder Chow Ah-Nam. From Xingning, the [[Dong River (China)|Dong River]] (\u6771\u6c5f) flows west out of [[Meizhou]] (\u6885\u5dde) through [[Hoh Yuen]], the place of origin for Iron Ox founder Choi Tit-Ngau. In the prefecture of [[Huizhou]], the Dong Kwong forms the northern border of Hu\u00ecy\u00e1ng (\u60e0\u967d) County, where Kwong Sai Jook Lum master Chung Yu-Chang and Chow/Chu Gar teacher Lau Shui grew up and established their martial arts reputation. From there, the Dongjiang flows into the [[Pearl River Delta]] (\u73e0\u6c5f\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32) at [[Bao'an County]] (present-day [[Shenzhen]]), where Kwong Sai Jook Lum masters Wong Yook-Gong and Lum Wing-Fay originated. These masters are all members of the Hakka community and the transmission of this remained within this community until the generation of Lau Shui and Lum Wing-Fay.\n\n=== Praying Mantis ===\nThe association of the term \"(Praying) Mantis\" with the style is also controversial. Each branch of the style offers a different explanation.\n\nThe traditions of the Chow Gar and Kwong Sai Jook Lum branches each maintain that their respective founders Chow Ah-Nam and Som Dot created their styles after witnessing a praying mantis fight and defeat a bird. Such inspiration is a recurring motif in the Chinese martial arts and can be found in the legends of Northern Praying Mantis, [[Fujian White Crane]], [[Tai chi]] and [[Wing Chun]].\n\nThe traditions of the Chu family branch contend that the name \"Southern Praying Mantis\" was chosen to conceal from Qing forces its political affiliations by pretending that this esoteric style of Ming loyalists was in fact a regional variant of the popular and widespread Northern Mantis style from [[Shandong]].<ref name=gene/>\n\nThe use of the term \"Praying Mantis\" seems appropriate when one considers the postures of well known practitioners of this style.  The emphasis on the techniques of sticky hands, the use of the forearm with the elbows tucked into the chest, claw like fingers and quick explosive actions creates an image that are visually similar to a praying mantis preparing to strike its prey.<ref name=\"Hagood2\">\n{{cite web | author = Roger D.

The legacy of Lau Soei that is related to the praying mantis name was his famous staff form - the Tong Long Bo Sim Staff ({{zh|t=\u87b3\u8782\u6355\u87ec\u68cd}}).\n\n=== Lau Soei ===\nLau Soei (1866\u20131942; \u5289\u745e; \u5289\u6c34\ufe5e) was a Hakka who established a reputation as a martial artist during the turn of the century in Southern China and later as a martial arts teacher in Hong Kong.<ref>\n{{cite web | title = Hong Kong Martial Arts Masters (\u9999\u6e2f\u6b66\u6797\u540d\u5e2b) | publisher = Hong Kong Wushu & Art Service Centre | url = http://wushuart.com.hk/museum/museum.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-23 }}</ref>\nLau Soei  was also known as the tiger of Dong Jiang (\u6771\u6c5f\u8001\u864e). His signature techniques include the \"Zhoujia (Chow Gar)-Tanglang-Sanjian\" (the three arrows of Zhoujia praying mantis, \u5468\u5bb6\u87b3\u8782\u4e09\u7bad\u62f3) and the staff form \u201cTanglang-puchangun\u201d (\u87b3\u8782\u6355\u87ec\u68cd\u5c24). Like many martial artists of his generation, he resettled in Hong Kong after the [[Chinese Civil War]]. He continued to teach the Southern Praying Mantis Style and many of his students eventually became teachers of this style. He was acknowledged by both the Chow Gar and the Chu Gar practitioners as the founding teacher of the system in the modern era.\n\n=== Chow Gar ===\nThe most famous branch of Southern Mantis martial arts, the Chow family (\u5468\u5bb6) branch traces its art to c. 1800 to Chow Ah-Nam (\u5468\u4e9e\u5357), a Hakka who as a boy left his home in [[Guangdong]] for medical treatment at the Southern [[Shaolin Monastery]] in [[Fujian]] where, in addition to being treated for his stomach ailment, he was trained in the martial arts and eventually created Southern Praying Mantis. His student was Wong Fook Go (\u9ec3\u798f\u9ad8) who was one of the teacher of Lau Soei.<ref name=CCMA/>\n\nThe continued popularity of modern Chow Gar is due to the work of [[Chow Gar#Chow Gar#Yip Shui (1912-2004)|Ip Shui]] (\u8449\u745e), a student of Lau Soei. He promoted the style within Hong Kong and later, to the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name=\"Whitrod\">\n{{cite web | title = Abridged History of Southern Praying Mantis | publisher = Chow Gar Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu (UK) | url = http://www.chowgarsouthernmantis.com | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-20 }}</ref>  and Australia.<ref name=\"Chow's Family Praying Mantis Kung Fu Association\">\n{{cite web | title = Chow's Family Praying Mantis Kung Fu Association | url = http://www.prayingmantiskungfu.com.au | access-date = 2010-04-09 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121231013327/http://www.prayingmantiskungfu.com.au/ | archive-date = 2012-12-31 | df =  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Brennan\">\n{{cite web | title = Chow Gar Tong Long, Brisbane, Australia\n | url = http://www.chowgar.com.au | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Chu Gar / Chuka / Chu Ka ===\nThe Chu family (\u6731\u5bb6) branch attributes its art to  Chu Fook-To, who created Southern Praying Mantis as a fighting style for opponents of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644&ndash;1912), a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] dynasty that overthrew the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] royal family (1368&ndash;1644), who were [[Han Chinese]]. This is the oldest branch in terms of origin and is the probable origin of the Southern Mantis style by way of age from which the other branches derived from. According to the Chu family branch, Chu was a member of the Ming Royal family who took refuge at  Shaolin Monastery in [[Henan]].  After the destruction of the Northern Shaolin Monastery, Chu escaped to the Southern Shaolin Monastery in [[Fujian]]. He then promoted his art in the surrounding regions.\n\nCurrent students of Chu Gar are not related to the students of Lau Soei. Lau Soei was friends with the a member of the Chu family. Chu's son, who had learned Chu Gar all his life, was sent to Lau Soei to learn Chow Gar. At a Demonstration a reporter asked Chu's son what style of kung fu he did and he replied \"Chu Gar\". Then the reporter asked him \"Who is your master?\" and because at the time he was training under Lau Soei he said Lau Soei was his master, the reporter misunderstood and thought Lau Soei taught Chu Gar. This is the story told by grandmaster Ng Si Kay, Son in law of Ip Shui, who has been the records keeper of Ip Shui's School for approximately 50 Years and is the current head of the Chow Gar Mantis Association in Hong Kong.\n\nCurrent students of Chuka are related to the students of Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong. Those students, Sigungs Tony Blum Jr, Eddie Chin and Manuel Rodriguez continue the tradition of his school. Sigung Tony Blum Jr. took over teaching of the System in 1995 in the Chicagoland area as appointed by Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong. He was then turned over the legacy and heritage in the United States by Si Tai Gung Sammy Wong before his passing in 2007. Sigung Manuel Rodriguez also continues teaching in Ventura, California area. Chuka can be found in China and the United States.\n\n=== Kwong Sai Jook Lum ===\nAccording to oral traditions, the Kwong Sai Jook Lum (\u6c5f\u897f\u7af9\u6797) style traces its origins to the temple Jook Lum Gee (\u7af9\u6797\u5bfa; Bamboo Forest Temple), [[Mount Wutai|Wu Tai Shan]] (\u4e94\u53f0\u5c71) in [[Shanxi]] province and on [[Mount Longhu|Mt. Longhu]] (\u9f8d\u864e\u5c71) in [[Jiangxi]] (\u6c5f\u897f) province. The monk Som Dot (\u4e09\u9054\u7956\u5e2b), created this new martial art system in the late 18th to early 19th century. He passed the art on to Lee Kun Ching (\u674e\u5b98\u6e05), later known as Lee Siem See (\u674e\u79aa\u5e2b); a name that can be translated as \"Zen master Lee\"). Lee Siem See would travel to Southern China and spread the art amongst the general population. In Guangdong, his student, Cheung Yiu Chung (\u5f35\u8000\u5b97), would later return with him to Kwong Sai (Jiangxi) Province to complete his training at Jook Lum Gee.\n\nIn 1919, Cheung returned to reside in Wei Yang Xian (Wei Yang County) Dan Shui in Guangdong Province.  During the winter of 1929, Cheung opened his first martial arts school and a [[traditional Chinese medicine]] clinic in Bao'an County in P\u00edngsh\u0101n (\u576a\u5c71) Town and continued to promote the Jook Lum system.  Wong Yook-Kong (\u9ec3(\u516c)\u6bd3\u5149), Lum Wing-Fay (\u6797\u69ae\u8f1d; 1910\u20131992; also known as Lum Sang, \u6797\u751f; Lum Sang can be translated as Mr. Lum) and Lee Wing Sing (\u674e\u814e\u52dd) are some of his students from that period.\n\nLee Wing Sing (\u674e\u814e\u52dd) originally trained in Chu Gar before becoming a student of Cheung Yiu Chung. He then continued his training at the Jook Lum Gee, learning a variant of Bamboo Forest Temple Praying Mantis that was somewhat different from (although related to) the art he learned under Cheung Yiu Chung. The lineage of Lee Wing Sing is continued by his family and disciples in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCheung eventually moved to Hong Kong.  He opened a martial arts studio and became the head teacher to the Hong Kong Hakka ship and dock workers union. The classes in Hong Kong was taught by Wong Yook-Kong<ref name=\"1992LeeWhite\">\n{{cite web|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/magazine/article.php?article=178|title=Secrets of Southern Praying Mantis - Henry Poo Yee's story|author1=Henry Lee|first=|author2=Harry A.

In the late 1950s, he taught at Free Mason {{sic}} Association Athletic Club, also known as Hung Ching. By 1963, his Kwong-Sai Jook Lum Gee Tong Long Pai was one of the largest kung fu schools.

It is a hard chi gung form and is usually the first to be learned. It strengthens the body, aiding its resistance to physical blows, and also develops power.

(season 6)|sixth season]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] renewed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for a seventh.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> This early renewal was a surprise following the series' low rated [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth season]],<ref name=\"S7RenewTHR\" /> but ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that this timing was likely due to the cast's contract negotiations and would help reduce costs by filming the sixth and seventh seasons back-to-back.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] later revealed that the series' crew had expected the shorter sixth season to be its last and were also surprised by the seventh season renewal. He attributed the decision to ABC watching early work on season six and believing the crew had found \"another wave of energy\" that they wanted to see continue.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> Responding to new rumors in March 2019 that the seventh season would be the series' last, Loeb stated, \"We're not ending.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon2019\" /> However, ahead of the series [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel in July 2019, Loeb announced that the seventh season would be the series' last. He explained that the cast and crew had originally expected the series to end with the fifth season, and had put other plans on hold to continue with the sixth. So, when ABC wanted to renew the series for a seventh season, they agreed to the decision if it could be the final season. Having this knowledge allowed them to build the season specifically to \"tie up any threads\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nBecause the season was ordered while the writers were working on the sixth season, they and showrunners [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] were able to plan a story that is split over both seasons with a cliffhanger ending the sixth season that the seventh can resolve.<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The writers tried to create more episodes in the season that were \"outside of [their] normal form of storytelling\", like the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]] episode \"[[4,722 Hours]]\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> For previous seasons, the writers divided their stories into different \"pods\" rather than stretching a single story over 22 episodes, but this was not necessary for the shorter 13 episode season.<ref name=\"DoGMay2019\" /> The seventh season's story features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms, a recurring subplot in the sixth season. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and \"look back at everything we\u2019ve done\".

(season 6)|sixth season]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] renewed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for a seventh.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> This early renewal was a surprise following the series' low rated [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth season]],<ref name=\"S7RenewTHR\" /> but ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that this timing was likely due to the cast's contract negotiations and would help reduce costs by filming the sixth and seventh seasons back-to-back.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] later revealed that the series' crew had expected the shorter sixth season to be its last and were also surprised by the seventh season renewal. He attributed the decision to ABC watching early work on season six and believing the crew had found \"another wave of energy\" that they wanted to see continue.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> Responding to new rumors in March 2019 that the seventh season would be the series' last, Loeb stated, \"We're not ending.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon2019\" /> However, ahead of the series [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel in July 2019, Loeb announced that the seventh season would be the series' last. He explained that the cast and crew had originally expected the series to end with the fifth season, and had put other plans on hold to continue with the sixth. So, when ABC wanted to renew the series for a seventh season, they agreed to the decision if it could be the final season. Having this knowledge allowed them to build the season specifically to \"tie up any threads\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nBecause the season was ordered while the writers were working on the sixth season, they and showrunners [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] were able to plan a story that is split over both seasons with a cliffhanger ending the sixth season that the seventh can resolve.<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The writers tried to create more episodes in the season that were \"outside of [their] normal form of storytelling\", like the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]] episode \"[[4,722 Hours]]\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> For previous seasons, the writers divided their stories into different \"pods\" rather than stretching a single story over 22 episodes, but this was not necessary for the shorter 13 episode season.<ref name=\"DoGMay2019\" /> The seventh season's story features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms, a recurring subplot in the sixth season. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and \"look back at everything we\u2019ve done\". The season begins in 1930s New York, prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D., before exploring more time periods.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nWith the season renewal, main cast members [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], [[Elizabeth Henstridge]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, [[Daisy Johnson|<!-- don't delink -->Daisy Johnson / Quake]], [[Leo Fitz]], [[Jemma Simmons]], [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], and [[Deke Shaw]], respectively. The renewal did not include series' star [[Clark Gregg]],<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> but Jed Whedon stated in April 2019 that the producers \"firmly believe that any season would have to have him in it\".<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The end of the sixth season revealed that a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Phil Coulson]] would appear in the seventh season, with Gregg starring as the new version of his character.<ref name=\"S7Premise\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /> This was the writers' solution to wanting to bring the character back without reversing the stakes of his death in the fifth season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" />\n\nIn August 2019, [[Hayley Atwell]] and [[Patrick Warburton]] were revealed to be returning to the series for the final season after previously making guest appearances as [[Peggy Carter]] and [[Rick Stoner]], respectively.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /><ref name=\"Warburton\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nProduction for the season began at the end of February 2019,<ref name=\"ProductionBegin\" /> in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"TVLineSetVisitMay2019\" /> Filming wrapped on July 30, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionEnd\" />\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===\nIn August 2019, Whedon and Tancharoen indicated that there would be a connection to the MCU in the final season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first footage of the season was released in August 2019 at the [[D23 Expo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2019/08/23/agents-of-shield-final-season-video-lmd-coulson-hydra-chronicoms/ |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
