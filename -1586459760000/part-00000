His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917\u20131969).\n\nPound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{efn|[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote in 1925: \"[W]e have Pound the major poet devoting, say, one fifth of his time to poetry. With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide.

He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: \"when the raft broke and the waters went over me\". The following year he was deemed unfit to stand trial, and incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.<ref>''The Pisan Cantos'' (80.665\u201367), Sieburth (2003), xiii</ref>\n\nPound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' while in custody in Italy. These parts were published as ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], leading to enormous controversy. Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him \"a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children\". Hemingway wrote: \"The best of Pound's writing\u2014and it is in the ''Cantos''\u2014will last as long as there is any literature.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745380,00.html \"Books: Unpegged Pound\"], ''Time'', 20 March 1933; Hemingway (2006), 25, from ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies by Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford, T.

He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907, where he fell out with several lecturers; during lectures on Shakespeare by [[Felix Emanuel Schelling|Felix Schelling]], the department head, he would wind an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke.

While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon, they decided to begin a 'movement' in poetry, called Imagism. ''Imagisme'', Pound would write in ''Riposte'', is \"concerned solely with ''language'' and ''presentation''\".<ref>Moody (2007), 180, 222</ref> The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. They agreed on three principles:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">1. Direct treatment of the \"thing\" whether subjective or objective.<br />\n2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.<br />\n3.

An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover \"Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art\".

Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].<ref>Moody (2007), 334\u2013335</ref> In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.<ref name=\"m342\" />\n\nIn 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. \"Propertius\" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as \"the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence\". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was \"incredibly ignorant\" of the language, and alluded to \"about three-score errors\" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began \"Cat-piss and porcupines!!\" and continued, \"The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation\". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.<ref>Kenner (1971), 286</ref>\n\n===''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley''===\n{{further|Wikisource:Hugh Selwyn Mauberley}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=left\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>There died a myriad\nAnd of the best, among them,\nFor an old bitch gone in the teeth,\nFor a botched civilization,<br />\nCharm, smiling at the good mouth,\nQuick eyes gone under earth's lid,<br />\nFor two gross of broken statues,\nFor a few thousand battered books.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley'', Section V (1920)}}\n\nHis poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.<ref>Pound, Ezra.

He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.<ref>Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.</ref>\n\nThe war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.<ref>Moody (2007), 394\u2013396</ref>\n\n''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: \"the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness.\"<ref>Witemeyer (1969), [https://archive.org/details/poetryofezrapoun0000wite_e2d2/page/25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&pg=PA201 201]</ref> Orage wrote in the same issue:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&nbsp;...

In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of ''[[The Waste Land]]'', then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who [[Blue pencil (editing)|blue-inked]] the manuscript with comments like \"make up yr. mind&nbsp;...\" and \"georgian\".<ref>Bornstein (1999), 33\u201334</ref> Eliot wrote: \"I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius.\"<ref name=NYTobit/>\n\nIn 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford's ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' from American attorney [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]]. The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 430\u2013431, 448</ref>\n\nHemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. \"They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work\", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], \"[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish\".<ref name=\"Meyers 1985 70 74\"/>\n\nPound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&pg=PA251 251]</ref> They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.<ref>For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390; for his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252\u2013256</ref>\n\n==Italy (1924\u20131945)==\n\n===Children===\n[[File:Barche-Rapallo.JPG|left|thumb|alt=photograph|The Pounds moved to [[Rapallo]] in 1924.<ref name=Tytell191/>]]\n\nThe Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner, a guest randomly tried to stab him; to Pound this underlined that their time in France was over.<ref name=Tytell191/> Hemingway saw how Pound \"indulged in a small nervous breakdown\", leading to two days in an American hospital.<ref>Baker (1981), 127</ref> They decided to move to a quieter place, choosing [[Rapallo]], Italy, a town of 15,000. \"Italy is my place for starting things\", he told a friend.<ref name=Tytell191>Tytell (1987), 191\u2013193</ref> During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.<ref>Tytell (1987), 225</ref>\n\nOlga Rudge, pregnant by Pound, followed them to Italy. She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.<ref>Tytell (1987), 198</ref>\n\nWhen Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.<ref>Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA13 13\u201315]</ref> In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 450\u2013451</ref> In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of ''[[Le Testament de Villon]]'', without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, \"next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well\".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 452\u2013453</ref> Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.<ref>For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII\u2013XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]]; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22\u201324]</ref> He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''D\u00e0 Xu\u00e9'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').<ref name=Nadelxxii>Nadel (1999), xxi\u2013xxiii</ref> That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914. By then Homer had retired, so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves. They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.<ref>Tytell (1987), 215</ref>\n\nPound began work on ''[[The Cantos]]'' in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.<ref name=Terrellvii>Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&pg=PR7 vii]</ref> The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June\u2013August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book''.<ref>Bush (1976), xiii\u2013xv</ref>\n\n===Turn to fascism, World War II===\nPound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called \"[[usury]]\", that the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.<ref>Preda (2005), 90</ref> He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact<!--vague--> with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' \"''divertente''\" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': \"'Ma questo' / said the boss, '\u00e8 divertente.'\" Pound said he had \"never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 228\u2013232</ref>\n\nWhen Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.<ref>Tytell (1987), 250\u2013253</ref>\n\nIn June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to [[James Laughlin]] that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with \"[[Heil Hitler]]\". He started writing for ''Action'', a newspaper owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], arguing that the [[Third Reich]] was the \"natural civilizer of Russia\".<ref name=Tytell254>Tytell (1987), 254</ref> After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.<ref name=Tytell253>Tytell (1987), 253\u2013265</ref>\n\n===Radio broadcasts===\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote= You let in the Jew and the Jew rotted your empire, and you yourselves out-jewed the Jew.

Pound wrote over 1,000 letters per year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''The Japan Times'' that \"Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'\" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name=Tytell253/>\n\nPound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: \"It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 260</ref> He recorded over 100 broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940, he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a \"rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar\", that throughout the \"disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage\". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped\u2014his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo\u2014and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.<ref>Tytell (1987), 264\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at Princeton University, and in July 1943, Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason.

Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.<ref>Gery (2010), 222</ref> In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to [[Gais, South Tyrol|Gais]] (a German-speaking South Tyrolian village of Italy), leaving Pound, as she would later write, \"pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 262</ref>\n\nPound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over {{convert|450|mile}} in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): \"In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops\u2014spent a night in the open and with some peasants\u2014got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'.\"<ref>Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264\u2013273</ref>}}\n\nHe returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone.

After two and a half weeks, he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: \"hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me.\" Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week.

He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' and ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and continued work on ''The Cantos''. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release.

They planned to have Pound awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].<ref name=Tytell302/>\n\nThe awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, [[Katherine Anne Porter]] and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as Conrad Aiken, W.

It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress.<ref name=Tytell302/>\n\n===Views and relationships===\nAlthough Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, he maintained his views in private. He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as \"Jews\", and urged visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination.<ref name=Tytell289/> He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite [[Eustace Mullins]], believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.<ref name=\"Wilhelm286\">Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306</ref>\n\nEven more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a far-right activist and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1953 called \"Make it New\", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front.<ref name=Hickman127>Hickman (2005), 127</ref> Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform.<ref name=Tytell306>Tytell (1987), 306\u2013308</ref> Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P.

Shortly after Hemingway won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, he told ''Time'' magazine that \"this would be a good year to release poets\".<ref name = \"Stock437\">Stock (1970), 437</ref> The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 303</ref> In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound released.<ref>Hemingway, Ernest.

He was also questioned relating to the bombing of the school.<ref>\"Police Firmness in Nashville\", ''Life'' magazine, 23 September 1957, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PD8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 34]; Tytell (1987), 308; Webb (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-dDQ6ZWRTzYC&pg=PA88 88\u201389]</ref>\n\nSeveral publications began campaigning for Pound's release in 1957. ''Le Figaro'' published an appeal titled \"The Lunatic at St Elizabeths\". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958, MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit stating Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.<ref name=LewisNYT>Lewis, Anthony.

The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; ''Canto CXIII'': alluded to it: \"Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell.\" Pound was in love with Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': \"The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill.\" Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.<ref name=Tytell328>Tytell (1987), 328\u2013332; for the reference to \"Canto 113\", see Sieburth (2003), xl</ref>\n\nBy December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and ''The Cantos'' botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: \"You\u2014find me\u2014in fragments.\" Hall wrote that he seemed in an \"abject despair, [[Acedia|accidie]], meaninglessness, [[Aboulia|abulia]], waste\". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he \"doubted the value of everything he had done in his life\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 347; Hall, Donald.

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a [[Neo-fascism|neo-Fascist]] [[May day parade|May Day parade]] in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: \"I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered&nbsp;... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning.\"<ref name=Tytell333>Tytell (1987), 333\u2013336</ref>\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed by Eliot in 1965. Pound went to Eliot's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats's widow. Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's ''The Waste Land''.<ref name = \"Nadel18\">Nadel (2007), 18</ref> He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.<ref name=Tytell337/>\n\n[[File:poundgrave.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Pound's grave on the [[Isola di San Michele]]]]\nShortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed that he be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before he died, Pound read for a gathering of friends at a caf\u00e9: \"re ''usury''/ I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is ''avarice''.\"<ref name=Tytell337>Tytell (1987), 337\u2013339</ref>\n\nOn his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom.

Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where he was buried near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 339; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf \"Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87\"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.</ref> Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.<ref name = \"Nadel18\"/>\n\n==Style==\nCritics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as \"The River Merchant's Wife\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7, 19</ref> According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an \"objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own\" without use of symbolism or romanticism.<ref name=Nadel19991>Nadel (1999), 1\u20136; Witmeyer (1999), 47</ref>\n\nDrawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the \"thoughtful man\" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.<ref>Coats (2009), 87\u201389</ref> Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].<ref>Stark (2001) 10\u201312</ref>\n\nPound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as \"raucous, nasal, scratchy\", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an \"ear\" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].<ref name = \"Ingham236\"/> His study of troubadour poetry\u2014words written to be sung (''motz et son'')\u2014led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.<ref name = \"Ingham236\">Ingham (1999), 236\u2013237</ref> He wrote that rhythm is \"the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit\".<ref>Pound (1968), 103</ref> Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments \"which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 244\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Imagism and Vorticism===\n[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]\n\nOpinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.<ref name=Nadel19991/> Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the \"exact\" word, stripping the writing down to the \"barest essence\".<ref>Oliver (2011), 87</ref> According to Nadel, \"Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics.\"<ref name=Nadel19991/> Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate \"all but the hardest kernel\" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem \"In a Station of the Metro\".<ref name = \"Albright60\"/> However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.<ref name = \"Albright60\">Albright (1999), 60</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nPound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some of the most \"significant modernist achievements in English\".<ref>Yao (2010), 34\u201335</ref> Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.<ref>Yao (2010), 33\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.<ref>Alexander (1997), 23\u201330</ref>\n\nIn Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.<ref name=Xie1999/> [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \"rethink the nature of an English poem\". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.<ref name=Kenner199>Kenner (1971), 199</ref> Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of \"The Seafarer\" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely \"trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language\".<ref name=Xie1999>Xie (1999), 204\u2013212</ref>\n\n===''The Cantos''===\n{{further|List of cultural references in The Cantos}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>And then went down to the ship,\nSet keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and\nWe set up mast and sail on that swart ship,\nBore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also\nHeavy with weeping, and winds from sternward\nBore us out onward with bellying canvas,\nCirce's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.\nThen sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,\nThus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.</poem>\n |source=\u2014 Canto I (1917)}}\n''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\">Nadel (1999), 1\u20136</ref> Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing \"themes and history\" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as \"travellers between nations\". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against \"a Poundian standard\" of modernism.<ref>Beasley (2010), 662</ref>\n\nPound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.<ref>Xie (1999), 217</ref> Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is \"a poem including history\", and that the \"historical figures lend referentiality to the text\". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which \"personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle\"\u2014most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\"/> Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it, \"These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 240</ref> In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with \"cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and \"at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated\".<ref>Tate (1965), 87</ref> This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.<ref>Nadel (1999), 8</ref> Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not \"make it cohere\".<ref>Nicholls (1999), 144</ref>\n\n===Literary criticism and economic theory===\nPound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a \"form of intellectual journal\". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and \"I Gather the Limbs of Osiris\", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets\u2014[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]]. The former piece was to \"remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry\"; in the latter he introduces the concept of \"luminous details\".<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 188\u2013191</ref> The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203</ref>\n\nPound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the \"most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought\".<ref>Redman (1999), 258</ref> Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.<ref>Redman (1999), 255\u2013260</ref> In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to \"aestheticize the political\", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a \"determined voice\".<ref>Nadel (1999), 10</ref> In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with \"strident impatience\", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nIn 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918\u201321'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&nbsp;...<ref name=Wilson1922>Wilson, Edmund (2007). \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that \"do not hang together\". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing \"unsatisfactory\". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.<ref name=Wilson1922/>\n\nThe rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.<ref>Beasley (2010), 651</ref> Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 \"initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound\". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.<ref name=\"Nadel12\">Nadel (1999), 12</ref> Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through \"sheer beauty of language\".<ref>Kenner (1983), 16</ref> Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Alexander (1997), 15\u201318</ref> Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/> In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/>\n\nFollowing Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as \"partisan\" and \"melodramatic\", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s \"neutral\" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a \"complete life\", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.<ref>Nadel (2010b), 162\u2013165</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including \"Canto LXXII\" and \"Canto LXXIII\".<ref name=\"Nadel13\"/> These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.<ref>Feldman (2012), 94</ref> In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a \"fundamental research tool\", according to Nadel.<ref name=\"Nadel13\">Nadel (1999), 13</ref> Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.<ref>Coats (2009), 81</ref> In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that \"the effort to uncover coherence in a&nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components\". He emphasized that Pound's \"economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated\".<ref>Surrette (1999) 13</ref>\n\nNadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, \"the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period\", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is \"the grid for reading Pound's poetry\".<ref>Nadel (2010a), 1\u20136</ref> In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the \"Pound files\" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that \"Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited\".<ref>Feldman (2012), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nPound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Bornstein (1999), 22\u201323</ref> Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.<ref>Witemeyer (1999), 48</ref> In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': \"All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned.\"<ref>Eliot (1917), 3</ref><!-- Pound strongly influenced the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]].<ref>O'Brien (1978), 205</ref> -->\n\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>I have tried to write Paradise<br />\nDo not move\n:::Let the wind speak.\n:::::that is paradise.\nLet the Gods forgive what I\n:::::have made\nLet those I love try to forgive\n:::::what I have made.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 [[The Cantos#Drafts and fragments of Cantos CX\u2013CXVII|Canto 120]]<ref>Canto 120, the final canto, first published in ''Threshold'', Belfast, and in ''The Anonym Quarterly'', New York, 1969.

[[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: \"In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did.\" The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was \"as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest\" in Ezra Pound.<ref>For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2</ref>\n\nPound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as \"National Monster\" and \"designated fascist intellectual\" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.<ref>Flory (1999), 285\u2013286, 294\u2013300</ref>\n\nLater in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\"/> [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, \"my poems don't make sense.\" He went on to say that he \"was not a lunatic, but a moron\", and to characterize his writing as \"stupid and ignorant\", \"a mess\". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he \"had shown us the way\", but Pound refused to be mollified:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions\u2014the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\">Carpenter (1988), 898\u2013899</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Kashner|first= Sam|date= 2005|title= When I Was Cool|url= |location= New York|publisher= HarperCollins Perennial|page= 86|isbn= 006000567-X|author-link= |quote= Allen explained how he tried to deal with anti-Semitic remarks.

His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917\u20131969).\n\nPound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{efn|[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote in 1925: \"[W]e have Pound the major poet devoting, say, one fifth of his time to poetry. With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. And in the end a few of them refrain from knifing him at the first opportunity.\"<ref>Hemingway, \"Homage to Ezra\", ''This Quarter'', 1, Spring 1925, 221\u2013225, in Hemingway (2006), 5\u20136</ref>}} Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound lost faith in [[Great Britain]] and blamed the war on [[usury]] and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: \"when the raft broke and the waters went over me\". The following year he was deemed unfit to stand trial, and incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.<ref>''The Pisan Cantos'' (80.665\u201367), Sieburth (2003), xiii</ref>\n\nPound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' while in custody in Italy. These parts were published as ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], leading to enormous controversy. Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him \"a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children\". Hemingway wrote: \"The best of Pound's writing\u2014and it is in the ''Cantos''\u2014will last as long as there is any literature.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745380,00.html \"Books: Unpegged Pound\"], ''Time'', 20 March 1933; Hemingway (2006), 25, from ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies by Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford, T.

Ezra's grandfather, [[Thaddeus C. Pound|Thaddeus Coleman Pound]] (1832\u20131914), was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman from northwest [[Wisconsin]] who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a [[Homer Pound House|house in Hailey]].<ref name=Moodyxiii>Moody (2007), xiii\u201313</ref> Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old.<ref name=\"Cockram238\">Cockram (2005), 238</ref> Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] at the [[Philadelphia Mint]].

He specialized in Latin. The boys wore [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling and the importance of submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.<ref>Moody (2007), 8\u20139</ref><!-- reference for previous two sentences --> After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s College of Liberal Arts.<ref>Moody (2007), 14; for Cheltenham Township High School, see McDonald (2005), 91, and Stock (1970), 11</ref>\n\n[[File:Hilda 'H.D.'

Signed up for the Latin\u2013Scientific course, he studied the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect]] with William Pierce Shephard and [[Old English]] with Joseph D. Ibbotson; with Shephard he read [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and from this began the idea for a long poem in three parts\u2014of emotion, instruction and contemplation\u2014planting the seeds for ''The Cantos''.<ref>Moody (2007), 18\u201325</ref> He wrote in 1913, in \"How I Began\":\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living&nbsp;... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could ''not be lost'' by translation and\u2014scarcely less important\u2014what effects were obtainable in ''one'' language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.{{pb}}In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with \"requirements for degrees\".<ref>Stock (1964), 6</ref></blockquote>\n\nPound graduated from [[Hamilton College]] with a BPhil in 1905, then studied [[Romance languages]] under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in [[Lope de Vega]]'s plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe.<ref>Moody (2007), 19, 27\u201328</ref> Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace. There, on 31 May 1906, he happened to be standing outside when the attempted assassination of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso]] took place, and Pound subsequently left the country for fear he would be identified with the anarchists. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the [[Sorbonne]], followed by a week in London.<ref>Moody (2007), 28\u201329</ref>\n\nIn July he returned to the United States, where in September his first essay, \"Raphaelite Latin\", was published in ''Book News Monthly''. He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907, where he fell out with several lecturers; during lectures on Shakespeare by [[Felix Emanuel Schelling|Felix Schelling]], the department head, he would wind an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke. His fellowship was not renewed.

While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon, they decided to begin a 'movement' in poetry, called Imagism. ''Imagisme'', Pound would write in ''Riposte'', is \"concerned solely with ''language'' and ''presentation''\".<ref>Moody (2007), 180, 222</ref> The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. They agreed on three principles:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">1. Direct treatment of the \"thing\" whether subjective or objective.<br />\n2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.<br />\n3.

An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover \"Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art\".

Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].<ref>Moody (2007), 334\u2013335</ref> In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.<ref name=\"m342\" />\n\nIn 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. \"Propertius\" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as \"the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence\". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was \"incredibly ignorant\" of the language, and alluded to \"about three-score errors\" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began \"Cat-piss and porcupines!!\" and continued, \"The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation\". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.<ref>Kenner (1971), 286</ref>\n\n===''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley''===\n{{further|Wikisource:Hugh Selwyn Mauberley}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=left\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>There died a myriad\nAnd of the best, among them,\nFor an old bitch gone in the teeth,\nFor a botched civilization,<br />\nCharm, smiling at the good mouth,\nQuick eyes gone under earth's lid,<br />\nFor two gross of broken statues,\nFor a few thousand battered books.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley'', Section V (1920)}}\n\nHis poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.<ref>Pound, Ezra.

He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.<ref>Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.</ref>\n\nThe war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.<ref>Moody (2007), 394\u2013396</ref>\n\n''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: \"the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness.\"<ref>Witemeyer (1969), [https://archive.org/details/poetryofezrapoun0000wite_e2d2/page/25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&pg=PA201 201]</ref> Orage wrote in the same issue:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&nbsp;...

In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of ''[[The Waste Land]]'', then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who [[Blue pencil (editing)|blue-inked]] the manuscript with comments like \"make up yr. mind&nbsp;...\" and \"georgian\".<ref>Bornstein (1999), 33\u201334</ref> Eliot wrote: \"I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius.\"<ref name=NYTobit/>\n\nIn 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford's ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' from American attorney [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]]. The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 430\u2013431, 448</ref>\n\nHemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. \"They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work\", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], \"[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish\".<ref name=\"Meyers 1985 70 74\"/>\n\nPound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&pg=PA251 251]</ref> They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.<ref>For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390; for his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252\u2013256</ref>\n\n==Italy (1924\u20131945)==\n\n===Children===\n[[File:Barche-Rapallo.JPG|left|thumb|alt=photograph|The Pounds moved to [[Rapallo]] in 1924.<ref name=Tytell191/>]]\n\nThe Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner, a guest randomly tried to stab him; to Pound this underlined that their time in France was over.<ref name=Tytell191/> Hemingway saw how Pound \"indulged in a small nervous breakdown\", leading to two days in an American hospital.<ref>Baker (1981), 127</ref> They decided to move to a quieter place, choosing [[Rapallo]], Italy, a town of 15,000. \"Italy is my place for starting things\", he told a friend.<ref name=Tytell191>Tytell (1987), 191\u2013193</ref> During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.<ref>Tytell (1987), 225</ref>\n\nOlga Rudge, pregnant by Pound, followed them to Italy. She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.<ref>Tytell (1987), 198</ref>\n\nWhen Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.<ref>Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA13 13\u201315]</ref> In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 450\u2013451</ref> In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of ''[[Le Testament de Villon]]'', without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, \"next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well\".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 452\u2013453</ref> Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.<ref>For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII\u2013XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]]; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22\u201324]</ref> He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''D\u00e0 Xu\u00e9'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').<ref name=Nadelxxii>Nadel (1999), xxi\u2013xxiii</ref> That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914. By then Homer had retired, so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves. They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.<ref>Tytell (1987), 215</ref>\n\nPound began work on ''[[The Cantos]]'' in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.<ref name=Terrellvii>Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&pg=PR7 vii]</ref> The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June\u2013August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book''.<ref>Bush (1976), xiii\u2013xv</ref>\n\n===Turn to fascism, World War II===\nPound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called \"[[usury]]\", that the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.<ref>Preda (2005), 90</ref> He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact<!--vague--> with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' \"''divertente''\" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': \"'Ma questo' / said the boss, '\u00e8 divertente.'\" Pound said he had \"never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 228\u2013232</ref>\n\nWhen Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.<ref>Tytell (1987), 250\u2013253</ref>\n\nIn June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to [[James Laughlin]] that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with \"[[Heil Hitler]]\". He started writing for ''Action'', a newspaper owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], arguing that the [[Third Reich]] was the \"natural civilizer of Russia\".<ref name=Tytell254>Tytell (1987), 254</ref> After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.<ref name=Tytell253>Tytell (1987), 253\u2013265</ref>\n\n===Radio broadcasts===\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote= You let in the Jew and the Jew rotted your empire, and you yourselves out-jewed the Jew.

Pound wrote over 1,000 letters per year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''The Japan Times'' that \"Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'\" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name=Tytell253/>\n\nPound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: \"It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 260</ref> He recorded over 100 broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940, he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a \"rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar\", that throughout the \"disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage\". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped\u2014his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo\u2014and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.<ref>Tytell (1987), 264\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at Princeton University, and in July 1943, Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason.

Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.<ref>Gery (2010), 222</ref> In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to [[Gais, South Tyrol|Gais]] (a German-speaking South Tyrolian village of Italy), leaving Pound, as she would later write, \"pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 262</ref>\n\nPound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over {{convert|450|mile}} in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): \"In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops\u2014spent a night in the open and with some peasants\u2014got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'.\"<ref>Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264\u2013273</ref>}}\n\nHe returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone.

After two and a half weeks, he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: \"hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me.\" Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week.

He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' and ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and continued work on ''The Cantos''. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release.

They planned to have Pound awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].<ref name=Tytell302/>\n\nThe awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, [[Katherine Anne Porter]] and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as Conrad Aiken, W.

It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress.<ref name=Tytell302/>\n\n===Views and relationships===\nAlthough Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, he maintained his views in private. He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as \"Jews\", and urged visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination.<ref name=Tytell289/> He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite [[Eustace Mullins]], believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.<ref name=\"Wilhelm286\">Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306</ref>\n\nEven more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a far-right activist and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1953 called \"Make it New\", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front.<ref name=Hickman127>Hickman (2005), 127</ref> Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform.<ref name=Tytell306>Tytell (1987), 306\u2013308</ref> Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P.

Shortly after Hemingway won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, he told ''Time'' magazine that \"this would be a good year to release poets\".<ref name = \"Stock437\">Stock (1970), 437</ref> The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 303</ref> In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound released.<ref>Hemingway, Ernest.

He was also questioned relating to the bombing of the school.<ref>\"Police Firmness in Nashville\", ''Life'' magazine, 23 September 1957, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PD8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 34]; Tytell (1987), 308; Webb (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-dDQ6ZWRTzYC&pg=PA88 88\u201389]</ref>\n\nSeveral publications began campaigning for Pound's release in 1957. ''Le Figaro'' published an appeal titled \"The Lunatic at St Elizabeths\". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958, MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit stating Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.<ref name=LewisNYT>Lewis, Anthony.

The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; ''Canto CXIII'': alluded to it: \"Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell.\" Pound was in love with Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': \"The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill.\" Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.<ref name=Tytell328>Tytell (1987), 328\u2013332; for the reference to \"Canto 113\", see Sieburth (2003), xl</ref>\n\nBy December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and ''The Cantos'' botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: \"You\u2014find me\u2014in fragments.\" Hall wrote that he seemed in an \"abject despair, [[Acedia|accidie]], meaninglessness, [[Aboulia|abulia]], waste\". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he \"doubted the value of everything he had done in his life\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 347; Hall, Donald.

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a [[Neo-fascism|neo-Fascist]] [[May day parade|May Day parade]] in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: \"I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered&nbsp;... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning.\"<ref name=Tytell333>Tytell (1987), 333\u2013336</ref>\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed by Eliot in 1965. Pound went to Eliot's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats's widow. Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's ''The Waste Land''.<ref name = \"Nadel18\">Nadel (2007), 18</ref> He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.<ref name=Tytell337/>\n\n[[File:poundgrave.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Pound's grave on the [[Isola di San Michele]]]]\nShortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed that he be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before he died, Pound read for a gathering of friends at a caf\u00e9: \"re ''usury''/ I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is ''avarice''.\"<ref name=Tytell337>Tytell (1987), 337\u2013339</ref>\n\nOn his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom.

Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where he was buried near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 339; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf \"Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87\"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.</ref> Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.<ref name = \"Nadel18\"/>\n\n==Style==\nCritics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as \"The River Merchant's Wife\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7, 19</ref> According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an \"objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own\" without use of symbolism or romanticism.<ref name=Nadel19991>Nadel (1999), 1\u20136; Witmeyer (1999), 47</ref>\n\nDrawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the \"thoughtful man\" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.<ref>Coats (2009), 87\u201389</ref> Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].<ref>Stark (2001) 10\u201312</ref>\n\nPound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as \"raucous, nasal, scratchy\", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an \"ear\" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].<ref name = \"Ingham236\"/> His study of troubadour poetry\u2014words written to be sung (''motz et son'')\u2014led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.<ref name = \"Ingham236\">Ingham (1999), 236\u2013237</ref> He wrote that rhythm is \"the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit\".<ref>Pound (1968), 103</ref> Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments \"which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 244\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Imagism and Vorticism===\n[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]\n\nOpinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.<ref name=Nadel19991/> Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the \"exact\" word, stripping the writing down to the \"barest essence\".<ref>Oliver (2011), 87</ref> According to Nadel, \"Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics.\"<ref name=Nadel19991/> Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate \"all but the hardest kernel\" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem \"In a Station of the Metro\".<ref name = \"Albright60\"/> However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.<ref name = \"Albright60\">Albright (1999), 60</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nPound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some of the most \"significant modernist achievements in English\".<ref>Yao (2010), 34\u201335</ref> Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.<ref>Yao (2010), 33\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.<ref>Alexander (1997), 23\u201330</ref>\n\nIn Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.<ref name=Xie1999/> [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \"rethink the nature of an English poem\". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.<ref name=Kenner199>Kenner (1971), 199</ref> Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of \"The Seafarer\" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely \"trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language\".<ref name=Xie1999>Xie (1999), 204\u2013212</ref>\n\n===''The Cantos''===\n{{further|List of cultural references in The Cantos}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>And then went down to the ship,\nSet keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and\nWe set up mast and sail on that swart ship,\nBore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also\nHeavy with weeping, and winds from sternward\nBore us out onward with bellying canvas,\nCirce's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.\nThen sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,\nThus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.</poem>\n |source=\u2014 Canto I (1917)}}\n''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\">Nadel (1999), 1\u20136</ref> Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing \"themes and history\" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as \"travellers between nations\". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against \"a Poundian standard\" of modernism.<ref>Beasley (2010), 662</ref>\n\nPound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.<ref>Xie (1999), 217</ref> Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is \"a poem including history\", and that the \"historical figures lend referentiality to the text\". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which \"personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle\"\u2014most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\"/> Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it, \"These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 240</ref> In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with \"cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and \"at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated\".<ref>Tate (1965), 87</ref> This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.<ref>Nadel (1999), 8</ref> Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not \"make it cohere\".<ref>Nicholls (1999), 144</ref>\n\n===Literary criticism and economic theory===\nPound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a \"form of intellectual journal\". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and \"I Gather the Limbs of Osiris\", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets\u2014[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]]. The former piece was to \"remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry\"; in the latter he introduces the concept of \"luminous details\".<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 188\u2013191</ref> The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203</ref>\n\nPound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the \"most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought\".<ref>Redman (1999), 258</ref> Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.<ref>Redman (1999), 255\u2013260</ref> In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to \"aestheticize the political\", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a \"determined voice\".<ref>Nadel (1999), 10</ref> In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with \"strident impatience\", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nIn 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918\u201321'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&nbsp;...<ref name=Wilson1922>Wilson, Edmund (2007). \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that \"do not hang together\". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing \"unsatisfactory\". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.<ref name=Wilson1922/>\n\nThe rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.<ref>Beasley (2010), 651</ref> Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 \"initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound\". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.<ref name=\"Nadel12\">Nadel (1999), 12</ref> Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through \"sheer beauty of language\".<ref>Kenner (1983), 16</ref> Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Alexander (1997), 15\u201318</ref> Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/> In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/>\n\nFollowing Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as \"partisan\" and \"melodramatic\", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s \"neutral\" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a \"complete life\", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.<ref>Nadel (2010b), 162\u2013165</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including \"Canto LXXII\" and \"Canto LXXIII\".<ref name=\"Nadel13\"/> These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.<ref>Feldman (2012), 94</ref> In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a \"fundamental research tool\", according to Nadel.<ref name=\"Nadel13\">Nadel (1999), 13</ref> Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.<ref>Coats (2009), 81</ref> In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that \"the effort to uncover coherence in a&nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components\". He emphasized that Pound's \"economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated\".<ref>Surrette (1999) 13</ref>\n\nNadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, \"the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period\", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is \"the grid for reading Pound's poetry\".<ref>Nadel (2010a), 1\u20136</ref> In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the \"Pound files\" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that \"Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited\".<ref>Feldman (2012), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nPound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Bornstein (1999), 22\u201323</ref> Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.<ref>Witemeyer (1999), 48</ref> In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': \"All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned.\"<ref>Eliot (1917), 3</ref><!-- Pound strongly influenced the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]].<ref>O'Brien (1978), 205</ref> -->\n\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>I have tried to write Paradise<br />\nDo not move\n:::Let the wind speak.\n:::::that is paradise.\nLet the Gods forgive what I\n:::::have made\nLet those I love try to forgive\n:::::what I have made.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 [[The Cantos#Drafts and fragments of Cantos CX\u2013CXVII|Canto 120]]<ref>Canto 120, the final canto, first published in ''Threshold'', Belfast, and in ''The Anonym Quarterly'', New York, 1969.

[[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: \"In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did.\" The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was \"as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest\" in Ezra Pound.<ref>For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2</ref>\n\nPound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as \"National Monster\" and \"designated fascist intellectual\" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.<ref>Flory (1999), 285\u2013286, 294\u2013300</ref>\n\nLater in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\"/> [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, \"my poems don't make sense.\" He went on to say that he \"was not a lunatic, but a moron\", and to characterize his writing as \"stupid and ignorant\", \"a mess\". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he \"had shown us the way\", but Pound refused to be mollified:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions\u2014the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\">Carpenter (1988), 898\u2013899</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Kashner|first= Sam|date= 2005|title= When I Was Cool|url= |location= New York|publisher= HarperCollins Perennial|page= 86|isbn= 006000567-X|author-link= |quote= Allen explained how he tried to deal with anti-Semitic remarks.
