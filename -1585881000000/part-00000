Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''.

He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Necropsar rodericanus skull.png|thumb|upright|left|Skull and [[temporomandibular joint]]]]\nHume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

Later examination of the sternum by Hume showed that ''Rodriguites microcarina'' was identical to the Rodrigues starling.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\n===Evolution===\nIn 1943, the American ornithologist [[Dean Amadon]] suggested that ''[[Sturnus]]''-like species could have arrived in Africa, and given rise to the [[wattled starling]] (''Creatophora cinerea'') and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of ''Sturnus'', rather than the [[glossy starlings]] (''Lamprotornis'') of Africa and the [[Madagascan starling]] (''Saroglossa aurata''); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds.<ref name=\"Amadon 1947\">{{cite journal |author=Amadon, D. |author-link=Dean Amadon |year=1943 |title=Genera of starlings and their relationships |journal=[[American Museum Novitates]] |volume=1247 |pages=1\u201316 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/4757/1/N1247.pdf |ref=refAmadon47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Amadon, D. |author-link=Dean Amadon |year=1956 |title=Remarks on the starlings, family Sturnidae |journal=[[American Museum Novitates]] |volume=1803 |pages=1\u201341 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5410/1/N1803.pdf |ref=refAmadon56}}</ref> A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-6409.2008.00339.x| title = Phylogenetic relationships among Palearctic-Oriental starlings and mynas (genera ''Sturnus'' and ''Acridotheres'': Sturnidae)| journal = [[Zoologica Scripta]]| volume = 37| issue = 5| pages = 469\u2013481| year = 2008| last1 = Zuccon | first1 = D. | last2 = Pasquet | first2 = E. | last3 = Ericson | first3 = P.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rodrigues Starling.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical restoration, based on Tafforet's account, subfossils, and related species]]\nThe Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=on|0}} in length. Its body was white or greyish white, with blackish-brown wings, and a yellow bill and legs.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet's complete description of the bird reads as follows:\n{{Quotation|A little bird is found which is not common, for it is not found on the mainland. One sees it on the islet au M\u00e2t [Ile Gombrani], which is to the south of the main island, and I believe it keeps to that islet on account of the birds of prey which are on the mainland, as also to feed with more facility on the eggs of the fishing birds which feed there, for they feed on nothing else but eggs or turtles dead of hunger, which they well know how to tear out of their shells. These birds are a little larger than a blackbird [R\u00e9union bulbul (''[[Hypsipetes borbonicus]]'')], and have white plumage, part of the wings and tail black, the beak yellow as well as the feet, and make a wonderful warbling. I say a warbling, since they have many and altogether different notes. We brought up some with cooked meat, cut up very small, which they eat in preference to seed.{{efn|name=Tafforet}}<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/><ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url = http://www.biodiversityheritagelibrary.org/item/99626#page/222/mode/1up | title = The Voyage of Fran\u00e7ois Leguat of Bresse, to Rodriguez, Mauritius, Java, and the Cape of Good Hope | year = 1891 | last1 = Tafforet | first1 = J. | editor1-last = Oliver | editor1-first = S.

He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Necropsar rodericanus skull.png|thumb|upright|left|Skull and [[temporomandibular joint]]]]\nHume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

Poyser\n|location=New Haven and London\n|isbn=978-0-7136-6544-4}}</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\nLeguat mentioned that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

Writing songs for ''Fallen'' started near the time of the band's formation; several of the songs that would feature on the album appeared on the band's earlier releases. ''Fallen'' was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period of mixing at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood. It is Evanescence's only album to feature guitarist [[Ben Moody]], who left the band later in 2003.\n\n''Fallen'' is the band's most commercially successful album to date, selling over 8 million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|best-selling albums of the 21st century]]. It debuted at number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 141,000 copies sold in its first week, peaking at number three in June 2003. The album topped the charts in more than ten countries, and has been certified seven-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n''Fallen'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. ''Fallen'' yielded four [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\", \"[[My Immortal]]\", \"[[Going Under]]\", and \"[[Everybody's Fool]]\". \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\" charted in over ten countries, including [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States. The album earned Evanescence five nominations at the [[46th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]], [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]. The band won in the latter two categories. At the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards|following year's ceremony]], the album garnered an additional nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] for \"My Immortal\". To further promote the album, Evanescence embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the ''Fallen Tour'', in 2004. A live album from this concert was released the same year, titled ''[[Anywhere but Home]]''.\n\n==Background and recording==\nAfter Evanescence was formed by [[Amy Lee]] and [[Ben Moody]] in 1995, the band released three [[extended play|EPs]] and one [[Demo (music)|demo CD]].

Writing songs for ''Fallen'' started near the time of the band's formation; several of the songs that would feature on the album appeared on the band's earlier releases. ''Fallen'' was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period of mixing at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood. It is Evanescence's only album to feature guitarist [[Ben Moody]], who left the band later in 2003.\n\n''Fallen'' is the band's most commercially successful album to date, selling over 8 million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|best-selling albums of the 21st century]]. It debuted at number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 141,000 copies sold in its first week, peaking at number three in June 2003. The album topped the charts in more than ten countries, and has been certified seven-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n''Fallen'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. ''Fallen'' yielded four [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\", \"[[My Immortal]]\", \"[[Going Under]]\", and \"[[Everybody's Fool]]\". \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\" charted in over ten countries, including [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States. The album earned Evanescence five nominations at the [[46th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]], [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]. The band won in the latter two categories. At the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards|following year's ceremony]], the album garnered an additional nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] for \"My Immortal\". To further promote the album, Evanescence embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the ''Fallen Tour'', in 2004. A live album from this concert was released the same year, titled ''[[Anywhere but Home]]''.\n\n==Background and recording==\nAfter Evanescence was formed by [[Amy Lee]] and [[Ben Moody]] in 1995, the band released three [[extended play|EPs]] and one [[Demo (music)|demo CD]].
