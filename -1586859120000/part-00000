The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].\n\n[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\nOn Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nFrom the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:TelfordBeatties.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatties]] department store at the west end of [[Telford Shopping Centre]], which was renamed [[House of Fraser]] in early 2007.]]\n[[File:Telford Town Centre .jpg|thumb|Northfield Street Telford Centre]]\n[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]\nThe New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].\n\nThe Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.\n\nIn 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.\n\nMany of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.\n\nIn 2007, a \u00a3250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire \u2013 Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart. Since the \"centre\" closed early evening, there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.\n\nThe first phase of the town centre development, named Southwater, was completed in 2014.<ref name=shropshirestar-20140313>{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/03/13/telfords-southwater-opening-schedule-is-unveiled/ |title=Telford's Southwater opening schedule is unveiled |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The official opening ceremony on 18 October 2014 included live music and fireworks.

Telford has no single town council because of this, and the Mayor of the Borough of Telford and Wrekin is also ''de facto'' the town's mayor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The town is also divided into Wards, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough. These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically \u2013 but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].\n\nTelford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour.  Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as MP in 2015. Telford is administratively part of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].\n\n==Demography==\n{{Telford area}}\nIn 1963 Dawley new town was intended to take 50,000 people from the [[West Midlands conurbation]]<ref>Dept. of Econ.

By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford's population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nTelford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households.

The foreign firms required larger factories, and they began to be built at Stafford Park.

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.<ref>N. Staffs. Jnl.

The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].\n\n[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\nOn Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nFrom the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:TelfordBeatties.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatties]] department store at the west end of [[Telford Shopping Centre]], which was renamed [[House of Fraser]] in early 2007.]]\n[[File:Telford Town Centre .jpg|thumb|Northfield Street Telford Centre]]\n[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]\nThe New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].\n\nThe Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.\n\nIn 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.\n\nMany of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.\n\nIn 2007, a \u00a3250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire \u2013 Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart.

Telford was created politically \u2013 but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].\n\nTelford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour.  Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as MP in 2015.

By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991.

Other large estates followed, in 1973 with '''Stafford Park''' just east of the [[Telford Town Centre|town centre]] and in 1979 with '''Hortonwood''', to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.\n\nIn total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.<ref>Private inf.; Thomas, 'Telford', 36-7; Fenter, 'Bldg.

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster.

centre of the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese Peninsula]] composed of 76 [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]]. At {{convert|513120|km2|abbr=on}} and over 68 million people, Thailand is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th-largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|21st-most-populous country]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangkok]], a special administrative area. Thailand is bordered to the north by [[Myanmar]] and [[Laos]], to the east by [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], and to the west by the [[Andaman Sea]] and the southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include [[Vietnam]] in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. It is a [[unitary state]]. Although nominally the country is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], the most recent [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], in 2014, established a ''[[de facto]]'' [[military dictatorship]] under a [[Military junta|junta]].\n\n[[Tai peoples]] migrated from southwestern China to mainland [[Southeast Asia]] from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Siamese'' dates to the 12th century. Various [[Indianised kingdoms]] such as the [[Mon kingdoms]], [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay states]] ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of [[Ngoenyang]], [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Lan Na]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], which rivalled each other. Documented European contact began in 1511 with a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, now one of the great powers in the region. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656\u20131688), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)|1767 Burmese\u2013Siamese War]]. [[Taksin]] (r. 1767\u20131782) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. He was succeeded in 1782 by [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]] (r. 1782\u20131809), the first monarch of the [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], which lasted into the early 20th century.\n\nThrough the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced pressure from [[French Colonial Empire|France]] and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], including forced concessions of territory; nevertheless, it remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct [[Western world|Western]] rule. Following a bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution in 1932]], Siam became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to \"Thailand\". While it joined the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] in [[World War I]], Thailand was an [[Thailand in World War II|Axis satellite]] in [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the [[United States]], and played a key [[Cold War|anti-communist role]] in the region as a member of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Apart from a [[1973 Thai popular uprising|brief period of parliamentary democracy]] in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. In 2013, Thailand [[2013\u20132014 Thai political crisis|endured a political crisis]] that culminated in two coups and the establishment of its [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|current and 20th constitution]] by a military junta.\n\nThailand is a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and remains a major ally of the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu003.asp |title=American foreign policy. 1950\u20131955; basic documents |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2321k |title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 2321k \u2013 Designation of major non-NATO allies |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Despite comparatively sporadic changes in leadership, it is considered a [[regional power]] in Southeast Asia and a [[middle power]] in global affairs.<ref>Jonathan H.

The word ''Siam'' may have originated from [[Pali]] (''suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi'', 'land of gold') or [[Sanskrit]] \u0936\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e (''\u015by\u0101ma'', 'dark') or [[Mon language|Mon]] \u101b\u102c\u1019\u100a(''rhma\u00f1\u00f1a'', 'stranger'). The names ''[[Shan people|Shan]]'' and ''[[Ahom people|A-hom]]'' seem to be variants of the same word.

Politically, there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.\n\nThe Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers {{convert|320000|km2|-3}} and is fed by the Chao Phraya, [[Mae Klong River|Mae Klong]], [[Bang Pakong River|Bang Pakong]], and [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi]] Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand is an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom's premier deepwater port in [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]] and its busiest commercial port, [[Laem Chabang]].\n\n[[File:Rueangrit 003.jpg|thumb|[[Ao Phang Nga National Park]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]]]]\n\nThe [[Andaman Sea]] is a precious natural resource as it hosts popular and luxurious resorts.

The idea has been greeted positively by Thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the [[Port of Singapore|Ports of Singapore]], improve ties with China and India, lower shipping times, eliminate pirate attacks in the [[Strait of Malacca]], and support the Thai government's policy of being the logistical hub for Southeast Asia. The canal, it is claimed, would improve economic conditions in the south of Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism income, and it would also change the structure of the Thai economy by making it an Asian logistical hub. The canal would be a major engineering project and has an estimated cost of US$20\u201330 billion.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Koppen-Geiger Map THA present.svg\n| width1 = 185\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Thailand map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification\n| image2 = Chiang Dao National Park Chiang Mai.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Cold air from China can bring colder temperatures to [[Northern Thailand]] close to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}}([[Doi Chiang Dao|Chiang Dao]] mountain pictured).\n| footer = \n}}\n\nThailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon).<ref name=tmd>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|title=The Climate of Thailand|publisher=Thai Meteorological Department|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801225446/http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2016}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The southwest monsoon, which starts from May until October is characterised by movement of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean to Thailand, causing abundant rain over most of the country.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} The northeast monsoon, starting from October until February brings cold and dry air from China over most of Thailand.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} In southern Thailand, the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Most of Thailand has a \"tropical wet and dry or savanna climate\" type ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]'s [[Tropical savanna climate]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Savannas|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=105|work=Biomes of the World|publisher=S.

There are also two specially governed districts: the capital [[Bangkok]] (Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) and [[Pattaya]]. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province.\n\nEach province is divided into [[amphoe|districts]] and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (tambons). {{As of|2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multi.dopa.go.th/pab/news/cate9/view46|title=Statistics of Administrative Divisions, Provincial Affairs Bureau|website=|access-date=}}</ref> there were 878 [[Amphoe|districts (\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d, amphoe)]] and the 50 [[districts of Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15}}, khet), which is further divided into 7,255 [[Tambon|subdistricts]] ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e33\u0e1a\u0e25}}, tambon) in the 76 provinces or [[Khwaeng|Bangkok's subdistricts]] (\u0e41\u0e02\u0e27\u0e07, khwaeng).

The name of each province's capital city ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07}}, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (''Changwat Chiang Mai'') is ''Mueang Chiang Mai'' or ''Chiang Mai''.\n{{Provinces of Thailand Image Map}}\n\n=== Regions ===\n[[File:Thailand four regions.svg|thumb|Thailand four-region division]]\n{{Main|Regions of Thailand}}\nThai provinces are administrated by regions. The regions that Thailand uses to divide the provinces is the four-region division system. It divides the country into the four regions:\n[[Northern Thailand]], [[Northeastern Thailand]], [[Central Thailand]]\nand [[Southern Thailand]]. Each region has its own different historical background, culture, language and people.\n\nIn contrast to the [[administrative division]]s of the [[Provinces of Thailand]], Thailand is a [[unitary state]], the provincial Governors, district chiefs, and district clerks are appointed by the central government. The regions themselves do not have an administrative character, but are used for [[geography of Thailand|geographical]], [[Statistics|statistical]], [[geology|geological]], [[meteorology|meteorological]] or [[tourism|touristic]] purposes.\n\n=== Southern region ===\n{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}\n[[File:Souththailandmap.GIF|thumb|left|Southern provinces of Thailand showing the Malay-Muslim majority areas]]\n\nThailand controlled the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far south as Malacca in the 15th century and held much of the peninsula, including Temasek (Singapore), some of the [[Andaman Islands]], and a colony on [[Java]], but eventually contracted when the British used force to guarantee their [[suzerainty]] over the sultanate.\n\nMostly the northern states of the Malay Sultanate presented annual gifts to the Thai king in the form of a [[Bunga mas|golden flower]]\u2014a gesture of tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage. The British intervened in the Malay State and with the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]] tried to build a railway from the south to Bangkok. Thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern Malay provinces of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Kelantan]], and [[Terengganu]] to the British. Satun and Pattani Provinces were given to Thailand.\n\nThe Malay peninsular provinces were occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and infiltrated by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (CPM) from 1942 to 2008, when they sued for peace with the Malaysian and Thai governments after the CPM lost its support from [[Vietnam]] and China subsequent to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after World War II with Sukarno's support for the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|PULO]].  Most victims since the uprisings have been Buddhist and Muslim bystanders.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Thailand}}\n[[File:Rama IX of Thailand and Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in a meeting with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], 18 November 2012]]\n[[File:Royal Thai Embassy Wellington New Zealand 2015.JPG|thumb|Royal Thai Embassy in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\nThe foreign relations of Thailand are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThailand participates fully in international and regional organisations. It is a [[major non-NATO ally]] and Priority Watch List [[Special 301 Report]] of the United States. The country remains an active member of ASEAN [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, whose foreign and economic ministers hold annual meetings. Regional co-operation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) host. Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, currently serves as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In 2005 Thailand attended the inaugural East Asia Summit.\n\nIn recent years, Thailand has taken an increasingly active role on the international stage. When [[East Timor]] gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand, for the first time in its history, contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. Its troops remain there today as part of a UN peacekeeping force. As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thailand has contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US.

In 1997 increased pressure on the [[Thai baht|baht]], a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9%, led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] administration to [[Floating exchange rate|float the currency]]. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year, triggering the [[Asian financial crisis]].\n\nThailand's economy started to recover in 1999, expanding 4.2\u20134.4% in 2000, thanks largely to strong exports. Growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001, but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia, a relatively weak baht encouraging exports, and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], known as [[Thaksinomics]]. Growth in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was 5\u20137% annually.\n\nGrowth in 2005, 2006, and 2007 hovered around 4\u20135%. Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency, by March 2008 the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark. While Thaksinomics has received criticism, official economic data reveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area increased from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iMeE4IHFr1q7Rr-eX5J1UmL3gcZQ?docId=b69c47e3-e4f5-4c32-8679-3d7ce5f040a3|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|last=Jones|first=Aidan}}</ref>\n\nWith the instability surrounding major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand settled at around 4\u20135%, from highs of 5\u20137% under the previous civilian administration. Political uncertainty was identified as the primary cause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that the Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1% GDP growth in 2011, to 5.5% in 2012 and then 7.5% in 2013, due to the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of fiscal stimulus measures introduced by the former [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |title=Thailand Economy To Rebound Strongly In 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |last=Phromchanya |first=Phisanu |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015133916/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |archivedate=15 October 2015  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Thai military coup of 22 May 2014, the AFP global news agency published an article that claimed that the nation was on the verge of recession.

The [[Ministry of Labour (Thailand)|Ministry of Labour]] defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented.<ref name=\":2\">Kongtip, Pornpimol et al. \"Informal Workers in Thailand: Occupational Health and Social Security Disparities\".

It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|title=Disposable People : New Slavery in the Global Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/disposablepeople00bale_0|url-access=registration|last1=Bales|first1=Kevin|website=ProQuest Ebook Central|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> While the Asian Financial Crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatisation and trade liberalisation in the country, and decreased federal subsidisation of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labour conditions.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Guille|first=Howard|date=2014|title=Reforming Asian Labor Systems: Economic Tensions and Worker Dissent|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39|via=}}</ref> These changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector, and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities. Many migrant farmers found work in Thailand's growing manufacturing industry, and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labour regulations and often exploitative conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol4/89-F10110.pdf|title=The Role of Informal Sector in Thailand|last=Warunsiri|first=Sasiwimon|date=2011|website=Research Institute for Policy Evaluation and Design|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThose that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centres, turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survival\u2014under the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs, one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labour reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. This can be described as the \"externalisation of market risk\", meaning that as the country's labour market became increasingly deregulated, the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves, whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidise the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector. The weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard, and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nToday, informal labour in Thailand is typically broken down into three main groups: subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers, service workers (including those that are employed in restaurants, as street vendors, masseuses, taxi drivers, and as domestic workers), and agricultural workers. Not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry. Individuals employed in these facets of the informal labour sector face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn general, education levels are low in the informal sector. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. Education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries, and enjoy the labour protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment. Because the informal labour sector is not recognised under the Labour Protection Act (LPA), informal workers are much more vulnerable labour to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognised industries. While some Thai labour laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers, they are often weak and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, Thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face, including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.<ref name=\":2\" /> As a result, labour trafficking is common in the region, affecting children and adults, men and women, and migrants and Thai citizens alike.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Thailand}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Bev\u00f6lkerungspyramide Thailand 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population in Thailand{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|20.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|62.9\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Thailand}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\n\nThailand had a population of {{UN_Population|Thailand}}{{UN_Population|ref}} {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.

Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from [[Hinduism]], [[animism]], as well as ancestor worship. The [[Thai solar calendar|official calendar]] in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (BE), which is 543 years ahead of the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian (Western) calendar]]. Thus the year 2015 is 2558 BE in Thailand.\n\nSeveral different ethnic groups, many of which are marginalised, populate Thailand. Some of these groups spill over into Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia and have mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences. [[Overseas Chinese]] also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power. Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.<ref name=\"Weidenbaum\">{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid/page/4 4]\u20138}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khon Thammasat 20090306 01.jpg|thumb|[[Khon]] show is the most stylised form of Thai performance.]]\nThe traditional Thai greeting, the ''[[Thai greeting|wai]]'', is generally offered first by the younger of the two people meeting, with their hands pressed together, fingertips pointing upwards as the head is bowed to touch face to fingertips, usually coinciding with the spoken words \"sawatdi khrap\" for male speakers, and \"sawatdi kha\" for females. The elder may then respond in the same way. Social status and position, such as in government, will also have an influence on who performs the ''wai'' first. For example, although one may be considerably older than a provincial governor, when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first. When children leave to go to school, they are taught to ''wai'' their parents to indicate their respect. The ''wai'' is a sign of respect and reverence for another, similar to the [[namaste]] greeting of India and Nepal.\n\nAs with other Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is paramount in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.\n\nTaboos in Thailand include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Thai art}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right|direction=vertical|width=220\n|width1=220\n|image1=WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG\n|caption1=Scene from the [[Ramakien]] depicted on a mural at [[Wat Phra Kaew]].\n|width2=220\n|image2=WatPhraSing035.jpg\n|caption2=Murals at [[Wat Phra Singh]].\n}}\n\nThe origins of Thai art were very much influenced by [[Buddhist art]] and by scenes from the Indian epics.

By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya period, thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by [[Indian art|Sri Lankan]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]].

This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of [[Western world|Western]] influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist [[Khrua In Khong]] is well known as the first artist to introduce [[linear perspective]] to Thai traditional art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/sightseeing/26933/wat-borommaniwat|title=Wat Borommaniwat|first=Post Publishing|last=PCL|website=www.bangkokpost.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, not to mention scenes of daily life.

Influenced by the architectural traditions of many of Thailand's neighbours, it has also developed significant regional variation within its vernacular and religious buildings.\n\nThe [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] movement, which went from approximately 1350 to 1767, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Thai architecture The identity of architecture in Ayutthaya period is designed to display might and riches so it has great size and appearance. The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead. The dominant feature of this style is sunlight shining into buildings. During the latter part of the Ayutthaya period, architecture was regarded as a peak achievement that responded to the requirements of people and expressed the gracefulness of Thainess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/olddata/files/01_Knowledge_1-3.pdf|title=\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e17\u0e33\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e23\u0e27\u0e08\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e15\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e32\u0e13\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19|publisher=[[Fine Arts Department]], Ministry of Culture(Thailand)}}</ref>\n\n[[Buddhist temples in Thailand]] are known as \"[[wat]]s\", from the [[Pali|P\u0101\u1e37i]] ''v\u0101\u1e6da'', meaning an enclosure.

It incorporates kicks, punches, knees and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in [[boxing]].\n\n[[Association football]] has overtaken muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in contemporary Thai society. [[Thailand national football team]] has played the [[AFC Asian Cup]] six times and reached the semifinals in [[1972 AFC Asian Cup|1972]].

Another widely enjoyed pastime, and once a competitive sport, is [[kite flying]].\n\n[[Volleyball]] is rapidly growing as one of the most popular sports.

[[Sepak takraw]] is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. The players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on the opponent's side.

centre of the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese Peninsula]] composed of 76 [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]]. At {{convert|513120|km2|abbr=on}} and over 68 million people, Thailand is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th-largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|21st-most-populous country]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangkok]], a special administrative area. Thailand is bordered to the north by [[Myanmar]] and [[Laos]], to the east by [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], and to the west by the [[Andaman Sea]] and the southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include [[Vietnam]] in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. It is a [[unitary state]]. Although nominally the country is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], the most recent [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], in 2014, established a ''[[de facto]]'' [[military dictatorship]] under a [[Military junta|junta]].\n\n[[Tai peoples]] migrated from southwestern China to mainland [[Southeast Asia]] from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Siamese'' dates to the 12th century. Various [[Indianised kingdoms]] such as the [[Mon kingdoms]], [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay states]] ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of [[Ngoenyang]], [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Lan Na]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], which rivalled each other. Documented European contact began in 1511 with a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, now one of the great powers in the region. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656\u20131688), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)|1767 Burmese\u2013Siamese War]]. [[Taksin]] (r. 1767\u20131782) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. He was succeeded in 1782 by [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]] (r. 1782\u20131809), the first monarch of the [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], which lasted into the early 20th century.\n\nThrough the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced pressure from [[French Colonial Empire|France]] and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], including forced concessions of territory; nevertheless, it remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct [[Western world|Western]] rule. Following a bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution in 1932]], Siam became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to \"Thailand\". While it joined the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] in [[World War I]], Thailand was an [[Thailand in World War II|Axis satellite]] in [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the [[United States]], and played a key [[Cold War|anti-communist role]] in the region as a member of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Apart from a [[1973 Thai popular uprising|brief period of parliamentary democracy]] in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. In 2013, Thailand [[2013\u20132014 Thai political crisis|endured a political crisis]] that culminated in two coups and the establishment of its [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|current and 20th constitution]] by a military junta.\n\nThailand is a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and remains a major ally of the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu003.asp |title=American foreign policy. 1950\u20131955; basic documents |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2321k |title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 2321k \u2013 Designation of major non-NATO allies |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Despite comparatively sporadic changes in leadership, it is considered a [[regional power]] in Southeast Asia and a [[middle power]] in global affairs.<ref>Jonathan H.

The word ''Siam'' may have originated from [[Pali]] (''suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi'', 'land of gold') or [[Sanskrit]] \u0936\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e (''\u015by\u0101ma'', 'dark') or [[Mon language|Mon]] \u101b\u102c\u1019\u100a(''rhma\u00f1\u00f1a'', 'stranger'). The names ''[[Shan people|Shan]]'' and ''[[Ahom people|A-hom]]'' seem to be variants of the same word.

Politically, there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.\n\nThe Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers {{convert|320000|km2|-3}} and is fed by the Chao Phraya, [[Mae Klong River|Mae Klong]], [[Bang Pakong River|Bang Pakong]], and [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi]] Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand is an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom's premier deepwater port in [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]] and its busiest commercial port, [[Laem Chabang]].\n\n[[File:Rueangrit 003.jpg|thumb|[[Ao Phang Nga National Park]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]]]]\n\nThe [[Andaman Sea]] is a precious natural resource as it hosts popular and luxurious resorts.

The idea has been greeted positively by Thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the [[Port of Singapore|Ports of Singapore]], improve ties with China and India, lower shipping times, eliminate pirate attacks in the [[Strait of Malacca]], and support the Thai government's policy of being the logistical hub for Southeast Asia. The canal, it is claimed, would improve economic conditions in the south of Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism income, and it would also change the structure of the Thai economy by making it an Asian logistical hub. The canal would be a major engineering project and has an estimated cost of US$20\u201330 billion.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Koppen-Geiger Map THA present.svg\n| width1 = 185\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Thailand map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification\n| image2 = Chiang Dao National Park Chiang Mai.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Cold air from China can bring colder temperatures to [[Northern Thailand]] close to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}}([[Doi Chiang Dao|Chiang Dao]] mountain pictured).\n| footer = \n}}\n\nThailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon).<ref name=tmd>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|title=The Climate of Thailand|publisher=Thai Meteorological Department|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801225446/http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2016}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The southwest monsoon, which starts from May until October is characterised by movement of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean to Thailand, causing abundant rain over most of the country.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} The northeast monsoon, starting from October until February brings cold and dry air from China over most of Thailand.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} In southern Thailand, the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Most of Thailand has a \"tropical wet and dry or savanna climate\" type ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]'s [[Tropical savanna climate]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Savannas|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=105|work=Biomes of the World|publisher=S.

There are also two specially governed districts: the capital [[Bangkok]] (Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) and [[Pattaya]]. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province.\n\nEach province is divided into [[amphoe|districts]] and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (tambons). {{As of|2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multi.dopa.go.th/pab/news/cate9/view46|title=Statistics of Administrative Divisions, Provincial Affairs Bureau|website=|access-date=}}</ref> there were 878 [[Amphoe|districts (\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d, amphoe)]] and the 50 [[districts of Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15}}, khet), which is further divided into 7,255 [[Tambon|subdistricts]] ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e33\u0e1a\u0e25}}, tambon) in the 76 provinces or [[Khwaeng|Bangkok's subdistricts]] (\u0e41\u0e02\u0e27\u0e07, khwaeng).

The name of each province's capital city ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07}}, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (''Changwat Chiang Mai'') is ''Mueang Chiang Mai'' or ''Chiang Mai''.\n{{Provinces of Thailand Image Map}}\n\n=== Regions ===\n[[File:Thailand four regions.svg|thumb|Thailand four-region division]]\n{{Main|Regions of Thailand}}\nThai provinces are administrated by regions. The regions that Thailand uses to divide the provinces is the four-region division system. It divides the country into the four regions:\n[[Northern Thailand]], [[Northeastern Thailand]], [[Central Thailand]]\nand [[Southern Thailand]]. Each region has its own different historical background, culture, language and people.\n\nIn contrast to the [[administrative division]]s of the [[Provinces of Thailand]], Thailand is a [[unitary state]], the provincial Governors, district chiefs, and district clerks are appointed by the central government. The regions themselves do not have an administrative character, but are used for [[geography of Thailand|geographical]], [[Statistics|statistical]], [[geology|geological]], [[meteorology|meteorological]] or [[tourism|touristic]] purposes.\n\n=== Southern region ===\n{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}\n[[File:Souththailandmap.GIF|thumb|left|Southern provinces of Thailand showing the Malay-Muslim majority areas]]\n\nThailand controlled the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far south as Malacca in the 15th century and held much of the peninsula, including Temasek (Singapore), some of the [[Andaman Islands]], and a colony on [[Java]], but eventually contracted when the British used force to guarantee their [[suzerainty]] over the sultanate.\n\nMostly the northern states of the Malay Sultanate presented annual gifts to the Thai king in the form of a [[Bunga mas|golden flower]]\u2014a gesture of tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage. The British intervened in the Malay State and with the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]] tried to build a railway from the south to Bangkok. Thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern Malay provinces of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Kelantan]], and [[Terengganu]] to the British. Satun and Pattani Provinces were given to Thailand.\n\nThe Malay peninsular provinces were occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and infiltrated by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (CPM) from 1942 to 2008, when they sued for peace with the Malaysian and Thai governments after the CPM lost its support from [[Vietnam]] and China subsequent to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after World War II with Sukarno's support for the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|PULO]].  Most victims since the uprisings have been Buddhist and Muslim bystanders.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Thailand}}\n[[File:Rama IX of Thailand and Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in a meeting with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], 18 November 2012]]\n[[File:Royal Thai Embassy Wellington New Zealand 2015.JPG|thumb|Royal Thai Embassy in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\nThe foreign relations of Thailand are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThailand participates fully in international and regional organisations. It is a [[major non-NATO ally]] and Priority Watch List [[Special 301 Report]] of the United States. The country remains an active member of ASEAN [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, whose foreign and economic ministers hold annual meetings. Regional co-operation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) host. Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, currently serves as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In 2005 Thailand attended the inaugural East Asia Summit.\n\nIn recent years, Thailand has taken an increasingly active role on the international stage. When [[East Timor]] gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand, for the first time in its history, contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. Its troops remain there today as part of a UN peacekeeping force.

In 1997 increased pressure on the [[Thai baht|baht]], a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9%, led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] administration to [[Floating exchange rate|float the currency]]. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year, triggering the [[Asian financial crisis]].\n\nThailand's economy started to recover in 1999, expanding 4.2\u20134.4% in 2000, thanks largely to strong exports. Growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001, but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia, a relatively weak baht encouraging exports, and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], known as [[Thaksinomics]]. Growth in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was 5\u20137% annually.\n\nGrowth in 2005, 2006, and 2007 hovered around 4\u20135%. Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency, by March 2008 the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark. While Thaksinomics has received criticism, official economic data reveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area increased from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iMeE4IHFr1q7Rr-eX5J1UmL3gcZQ?docId=b69c47e3-e4f5-4c32-8679-3d7ce5f040a3|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|last=Jones|first=Aidan}}</ref>\n\nWith the instability surrounding major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand settled at around 4\u20135%, from highs of 5\u20137% under the previous civilian administration. Political uncertainty was identified as the primary cause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that the Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1% GDP growth in 2011, to 5.5% in 2012 and then 7.5% in 2013, due to the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of fiscal stimulus measures introduced by the former [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |title=Thailand Economy To Rebound Strongly In 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |last=Phromchanya |first=Phisanu |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015133916/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |archivedate=15 October 2015  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Thai military coup of 22 May 2014, the AFP global news agency published an article that claimed that the nation was on the verge of recession.

The [[Ministry of Labour (Thailand)|Ministry of Labour]] defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented.<ref name=\":2\">Kongtip, Pornpimol et al. \"Informal Workers in Thailand: Occupational Health and Social Security Disparities\".

It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|title=Disposable People : New Slavery in the Global Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/disposablepeople00bale_0|url-access=registration|last1=Bales|first1=Kevin|website=ProQuest Ebook Central|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> While the Asian Financial Crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatisation and trade liberalisation in the country, and decreased federal subsidisation of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labour conditions.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Guille|first=Howard|date=2014|title=Reforming Asian Labor Systems: Economic Tensions and Worker Dissent|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39|via=}}</ref> These changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector, and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities. Many migrant farmers found work in Thailand's growing manufacturing industry, and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labour regulations and often exploitative conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol4/89-F10110.pdf|title=The Role of Informal Sector in Thailand|last=Warunsiri|first=Sasiwimon|date=2011|website=Research Institute for Policy Evaluation and Design|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThose that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centres, turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survival\u2014under the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs, one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labour reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. This can be described as the \"externalisation of market risk\", meaning that as the country's labour market became increasingly deregulated, the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves, whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidise the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector. The weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard, and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nToday, informal labour in Thailand is typically broken down into three main groups: subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers, service workers (including those that are employed in restaurants, as street vendors, masseuses, taxi drivers, and as domestic workers), and agricultural workers. Not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry. Individuals employed in these facets of the informal labour sector face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn general, education levels are low in the informal sector. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. Education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries, and enjoy the labour protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment. Because the informal labour sector is not recognised under the Labour Protection Act (LPA), informal workers are much more vulnerable labour to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognised industries. While some Thai labour laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers, they are often weak and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, Thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face, including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.<ref name=\":2\" /> As a result, labour trafficking is common in the region, affecting children and adults, men and women, and migrants and Thai citizens alike.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Thailand}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Bev\u00f6lkerungspyramide Thailand 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population in Thailand{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|20.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|62.9\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Thailand}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\n\nThailand had a population of {{UN_Population|Thailand}}{{UN_Population|ref}} {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.

Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from [[Hinduism]], [[animism]], as well as ancestor worship. The [[Thai solar calendar|official calendar]] in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (BE), which is 543 years ahead of the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian (Western) calendar]]. Thus the year 2015 is 2558 BE in Thailand.\n\nSeveral different ethnic groups, many of which are marginalised, populate Thailand. Some of these groups spill over into Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia and have mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences. [[Overseas Chinese]] also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power. Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.<ref name=\"Weidenbaum\">{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid/page/4 4]\u20138}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khon Thammasat 20090306 01.jpg|thumb|[[Khon]] show is the most stylised form of Thai performance.]]\nThe traditional Thai greeting, the ''[[Thai greeting|wai]]'', is generally offered first by the younger of the two people meeting, with their hands pressed together, fingertips pointing upwards as the head is bowed to touch face to fingertips, usually coinciding with the spoken words \"sawatdi khrap\" for male speakers, and \"sawatdi kha\" for females. The elder may then respond in the same way. Social status and position, such as in government, will also have an influence on who performs the ''wai'' first. For example, although one may be considerably older than a provincial governor, when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first. When children leave to go to school, they are taught to ''wai'' their parents to indicate their respect. The ''wai'' is a sign of respect and reverence for another, similar to the [[namaste]] greeting of India and Nepal.\n\nAs with other Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is paramount in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.\n\nTaboos in Thailand include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Thai art}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right|direction=vertical|width=220\n|width1=220\n|image1=WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG\n|caption1=Scene from the [[Ramakien]] depicted on a mural at [[Wat Phra Kaew]].\n|width2=220\n|image2=WatPhraSing035.jpg\n|caption2=Murals at [[Wat Phra Singh]].\n}}\n\nThe origins of Thai art were very much influenced by [[Buddhist art]] and by scenes from the Indian epics.

By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya period, thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by [[Indian art|Sri Lankan]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]].

This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of [[Western world|Western]] influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist [[Khrua In Khong]] is well known as the first artist to introduce [[linear perspective]] to Thai traditional art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/sightseeing/26933/wat-borommaniwat|title=Wat Borommaniwat|first=Post Publishing|last=PCL|website=www.bangkokpost.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, not to mention scenes of daily life.

Influenced by the architectural traditions of many of Thailand's neighbours, it has also developed significant regional variation within its vernacular and religious buildings.\n\nThe [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] movement, which went from approximately 1350 to 1767, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Thai architecture The identity of architecture in Ayutthaya period is designed to display might and riches so it has great size and appearance. The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead. The dominant feature of this style is sunlight shining into buildings. During the latter part of the Ayutthaya period, architecture was regarded as a peak achievement that responded to the requirements of people and expressed the gracefulness of Thainess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/olddata/files/01_Knowledge_1-3.pdf|title=\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e17\u0e33\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e23\u0e27\u0e08\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e15\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e32\u0e13\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19|publisher=[[Fine Arts Department]], Ministry of Culture(Thailand)}}</ref>\n\n[[Buddhist temples in Thailand]] are known as \"[[wat]]s\", from the [[Pali|P\u0101\u1e37i]] ''v\u0101\u1e6da'', meaning an enclosure.
