This dispute was a consequence of each country's interpretation of what Real Cedulas (Royal Proclamations) Spain used to precisely define its colonial territories in the Americas. After independence, all of Spain's colonial territories signed and agreed to proclaim their limits in the basis of the principle ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' which accepts the Spanish colonial borders of 1810 as the borders of the new republics. Thus the borders of Gran Colombia which included Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela would follow the borders of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], and Peru the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] in 1810. However, Peru was not satisfied with this and tried to set the date of her Uti Possitedis to 1824- a time when Peru was officially independent with territories Peru militarily occupied since 1820.\n\nTumbes and Jaen de Bracamoros, to which Peru had no colonial titles, were territories that declared their independence in 1820 and were militarily occupied by Peruvian patriot forces that convinced the people in these territories to join Peru. Because of this, Peru claims that part of its western territorial borders where it lacks title is derived from free determination of its people in the border areas after independence. In the eastern section known as Maynas or Mainas, which was the sparsely inhabited and entirely Amazon Basin, Peru bases its legal claims on the disputed Real Cedula of 1802 by which the Government of Maynas and the Government of Quijos, as well as the missions established in the rivers that flow into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, which belonged until then to the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, passed to the political and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\nFrom the content of this Real Cedula it is clear that its main objective was to stop the Portuguese advances to the territories of the Spanish crown. [[Gran Colombia]] which declared independence 2 years earlier in 1819 and helped [[Spanish American wars of independence|Peruvian independence war]] in the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn|battles of Jun\u00edn]] and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] bases its rights on the clear Real Cedulas of 1717, 1739 and 1740 and declares that the Real Cedula of 1802 is not political in nature, but was meant only for ecclesiastical and military jurisdiction, so also Peru bases in the clear Real Cedula of 1803 which ordered the incorporation of the province of Guayaquil to the Viceroyalty of Peru in which the two viceroys immediately proceeded to comply with the royal order and in fact and in law, Guayaquil became part of the viceroyalty of Lima.\n\nDuring the first 10 years of independence, Gran Colombia, under the leadership of [[Simon Bolivar]], had continually protested Peru's occupation of Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n; Maynas had not been militarily occupied yet. Peru ignored Bol\u00edvar's ultimatum to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n or face war. Bol\u00edvar then declared war and Peru responded by successfully invading and occupying southern Ecuador with a force of 8,000 soldiers. Bolivar sent Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sucre to Ecuador who lead 4,000 Gran Colombian soldiers that defeated the Peruvian invaders in the Battle of Tarqui in 1829. The Treaty of Giron ended the war and the Treaty of Guayaquil in 1829 more or less restated the borders of Uti Possidetis juris of 1810 with slight modification in favor of Peru to form a clear border. Negotiations known as protocolized conferences began and Gran Colombia ceded some of its territory for the sake of peace and to have river borders to avoid future disputes. During these conferences both parties agreed that in the west the borders should follow the rivers Tumbes, but that either the Huancabamba or the Chinchipe would be decided later. In the east both agreed to divide Maynas in half and that both republics would be separated entirely by the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Amazon rivers until the border reaches Brazil. On August 10, 1830 a treaty was signed known as the Protocolo de Mosquera-Pedimonte which summarized the results of the protocolized conferences. This treaty was to end the border conflict once and for all, however, Ecuador split from Gran Colombia and thus the ones who signed the treaty did not have any negotiating powers. When Peru found out that Ecuador had seceded from Gran Colombia it decided to retain Ja\u00e9n and Tumbes in the west and to slowly invade the Amazon Basin north of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river.\n\nWhen the Republic of Ecuador proclaimed its [[secession]] from Gran Colombia in 1830 its government negotiated a swap of territories in the Amazon basin for debt with the British creditors, and the dispute over the territories re-ignited in 1857. Peru implemented a maritime [[blockade]] of the port of [[Guayaquil]] demanding a revocation of the deal, as well as an acknowledgment of Peruvian sovereignty over the disputed territories. These demands went unheeded and with Ecuador in a state of civil war, the government of [[Guillermo Franco (Ecuadorian general)|Guillermo Franco]] in the province of Guayaquil, claiming to represent the entire country, agreed to Peru's demands and signed the Treaty of [[Mapasingue]] of 1860. [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]]'s provisional government won the civil war later that year, and voided this treaty, with the new Peruvian government following suit several years later.\n\nThe dispute continued through the late 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Numerous attempts were made to define the borders, but both governments could not come to an agreement acceptable to their constituencies. A [[Colombia\u2013Peru War|war between Colombia and Peru]] occurred during 1932 and 1933 in the Eastern region of the Amazon territories and resulted in the official designation of the [[Putumayo River]] as a border between Colombia and Peru; but sectors of the society considered this detrimental to the Ecuadorian cause, with Colombia now recognizing Peru's rights to the territory that Ecuador claimed as its own. An agreement recognizing territories in ''[[de facto]]'' possession by each country was signed in 1936, but minor military skirmishes began to occur in 1938. Tensions escalated, and [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|war broke out in July 1941]], and officially came to an end with the signing of the [[Rio Protocol|Rio de Janeiro Protocol]] on January 29, 1942.  The treaty was intended to finally bring the long-running territorial dispute to an end, but in 1960 the then-president of Ecuador Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa Velasco Ibarra proposed to the Congress a thesis of nullity based in the fact that the 1942 protocol was forced upon the Ecuadorian government under duress.\n\nA brief military clash took place in early 1981, when the [[Peruvian Army]] forcefully took control of three Ecuadorian military outposts on the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] mountain range. An agreement in 1992 between the presidents of the two countries promised to seek peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, in December 1994, the Ecuadorian army was seen to be mobilizing in the vicinity of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor. On January 26, 1995, [[Cenepa War|war broke out]] over control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the [[Cenepa River]], within a 78-kilometer strip of territory that both countries claimed as their own. In this case, the result was favorable for Peru who succeeded in taking all the Ecuadorian outposts set in Peruvian territory, although Ecuador caused some casualties. The fighting came to an end after just over one month, with the signing of the Montevideo Declaration on February 28, and the later signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration under the supervision of the guarantors of the Rio Protocol of 1942: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S.\n\nTensions subsided but persisted over the next three years. On October 26, 1998, Ecuador and Peru signed a comprehensive peace accord that established a framework for ending a border dispute. Formal demarcation of border regions started on May 13, 1999. The agreement was ratified without opposition by the congresses of both nations, finally bringing an end to the dispute, almost two centuries after the South American nations (or their predecessors) claimed their independence from the Spanish Crown.\n\n==Colonial period==\n{{Main|Viceroyalty of Peru}}\n\n===Spanish conquest and establishment of the Viceroyalty of Peru===\nBeginning with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, the Spanish [[conquistadores]] expanded the range of the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown's]] reach from early small settlements in the Caribbean to various continental territories, eventually including [[Central America]] and most of South America.\n\nThe Spaniards arrived at the borders of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1528, and on November 16, 1532, taking advantage of the [[Inca Civil War]], the tiny army of [[Francisco Pizarro]] began the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]]. In the following decades, Spain consolidated its power over the entire Andean region, repressing successive indigenous rebellions.\n\nTo govern the new territories of Spain, in 1542 [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (King Charles I of Spain) created two [[Viceroyalty|Viceroyalties]], the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (in modern-day [[Mexico]]) and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (a.k.a. the Viceroyalty of New Castile). In 1542, King Charles named [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] Peru's first viceroy, but the viceroyalty was not organized until the arrival of Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa|Francisco de Toledo]] in 1572. Toledo promptly declared war on [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], the last refuge of the Inca; soon afterwards, [[Tupac Amaru]], the last Inca emperor, was captured and executed in [[Cuzco]].\n\n===Territorial division of the Viceroyalty of Peru===\n[[File:Audencias of Viceroyalty of Peru.PNG|thumb|right|Territorial divisions of the Viceroyalty of Peru as described by the laws compiled in the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n'' of 1680.]]\nBecause the territory of the Viceroyalty of Peru was so large, and far away from centers of government in [[Real Audiencia of Lima|Lima]] and [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], Peru (as well as New Spain) was divided into a number of ''real [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s'' (royal audiences), a type of superior judicial tribunal that combined executive and judicial authority, and can be considered \"major [[province]]s\". The audiences controlled the ''gobernaciones'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the civil, as distinguished from the military, branch of the colonial governmental entities lesser in extent than the audiencias.\" (1910)</ref> ''alcaldias mayores'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the jurisdiction of the ''Alcalde mayor'', who, as mayor, governed a town of lesser importance than the capital of a province.\" (1910)</ref> ''corregimientos'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the district governed by a ''Corregidor'', a correctional magistrate, who, in colonial times, exercised administrative functions over a district. (1910)</ref> and ''alcaldias ordinarias''.<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"jurisdiction of the ''Alcalde ordinario'', who was similar to the alcaldia mayor, but of lesser extent. (1910)</ref> The territory was also divided [[ecclesiastical]]ly, into archbishoprics, religious provinces, suggragan bishopries, parishes and curateships. The archbishoprics and religious provinces corresponded with the audiences, the bishoprics with the ''gobernaciones'' and ''alcaldias mayores'', and the parishes and curateships with the ''corregimientos'' and ''alcaldias ordinarias''.<ref name=1910eight>Paredes-Van Dyke p.8.</ref>\n\nThese civil divisions were not uniform, with numerous exceptions being made based on the specific circumstances.  The Viceroys were presidents of the audiences at the capitals of their Viceroyalties, with other audiences being presided over by captains-generals, or by persons known as gowned presidents. Power was devolved to the captains-general of an audience by the Viceroy, and the audience's territory was administered by the audience's president and the political, military, and religious officials underneath him.<ref name=1910eight/>\n\nBetween 1542 and 1717, the Viceroyalty controlled most of the territory of South America (save for a few non-Spanish colonies and the Commandancy General of [[Caracas]], which was a dependency of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]). The territory was divided among (noting dates of creation):\n\n#[[Real Audiencia of Panam\u00e1|Royal Audience of Tierra Firme]] (1564)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1|Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (1548)\n#[[Royal Audience of Quito|Royal Audience of San Francisco of Quito]] (1563)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Lima|Royal Audience of the City of Kings Lima]] (1543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Royal Audience of La Plata de los Charcas]] (1559)\n#[[Royal Audiencia of Concepci\u00f3n|Royal Audience of Chile]] (1563\u20131573; 1606)\n\nThe district of an audience was established in the royal decree by which it was created; the laws laid out in the myriad of ''C\u00e9dulas Reales'' issued by the Spanish Crown were compiled several times throughout the centuries-long history of Spanish presence in the region. These compilations were referred to as the [[Laws of the Indies]]; the 1680 compilation, organized under Charles II, known as the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n de las Leyes de los Reynos de Indias'' (Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies), set a template by which the laws were organized.\n\nUnder Title XV of Book II of the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n'', the limits of the audiences of Lima and Quito were defined as follows:\n\n{{quotebox|width=100%|align=left|\n*The district of the '''Royal Audience of San Francisco of Quito''' was described in Law X, Title XV of Book II: \"In the City of [[Quito|San Francisco of Quito]], in Peru, shall reside another Royal Audience and Chancellery of ours, with a president; four judges of [[Private law|civil cases]] [''oidores''], who will also be judges of [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] [''alcaldes del crimen'']; a crown attorney [''fiscal'']; a bailiff [''alguacil mayor'']; a lieutenant of the Gran Chancellor; and the other necessary ministers and officials; and which shall have for district the Province of Quito, and along the coast towards the [[Lima|Ciudad de los Reyes]] [Lima] to the Port of [[Paita]], exclusive; and inland towards [[Piura]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]], [[Moyobamba]] and [[Huallaga River|Motilones]], exclusive, including towards the aforesaid part the towns of [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]], [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador|Valladolid]], [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]], [[Zamora, Ecuador|Zamora]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador|La Zarza]] and [[Guayaquil]], with the rest of the towns, which are in their districts or will be founded [in them]; and towards the towns of [[La Canela]] and [[Quijos Canton|Quijos]], it should include said towns and the rest that shall be discovered; and along the coast towards [[Panama]], until the [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Port of Buenaventura]], inclusive; and inland to [[Pasto (Colombia)|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], Chapanchinca and Guarchicona; because the rest of the places of the Government (''Gobernaci\u00f3n'') of Popay\u00e1n are of the Audience of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], with which, and with the one of [[Tierra Firma|Tierrafirme]] [Panama], it shall share a border on the north; and with the one of Los Reyes in the south; having for its western border the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]] [Pacific Ocean] and eastern the provinces still not yet pacified nor discovered.\"<ref name=\"p.56 1910\">p.56 (1910)</ref><ref name=title15>{{Cite book| author = Spain|title = Recopilaci\u00f3n de las Leyes de Indias.

In October 1777 the Treaty of San Idelfonso was signed, recognizing the rivers [[Japur\u00e1 River|Japur\u00e1]] and [[Javary River|Javary]] as the border with Portugal, leaving some sectors without exact delimitation. Spain sent Francisco de Requena on a scientific expedition to learn the geography of the region in order to clarify the territorial limits; after nine years, following disagreements with the counterpart Portuguese commission, de Requena left the region, leaving the border situation unresolved.\n*De Requena's remaining in Lima with aspirations of being named Viceroy of Peru, and his desire that [[Maynas Province|Maynas]] become part of the Viceroyalty, according to his report to the King of Spain.\n*Francisco de Requena's report furthered the interests of Peru, which wanted to assist the College of Ocopa Jesuit religious congregation in recolonizing the eastern Upper [[Ucayali]] region from which they had been previously expelled. -->\n\n==1803\u20131818==\n\n*1803: A similar event occurred in 1803, when it was decided that the military affairs of the Province of Guayaquil (whose capital was the strategically situated port city of [[Guayaquil]]) would be run from Lima.\n* 1810: all administrative and economic affairs of the province were turned over to the Viceroyalty of Peru, a state of affairs that would endure until 1819. Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros had no such cedula transferring it to Peru and would rightly belong to Ecuador. However, Ja\u00e9n decided to join Peru after it took part in northern Peru's revolutionary wars of independence.\n* September 28, 1812: the Council of Regency requested from Madrid the ''Expediente sobre la erecci\u00f3n del Obispado de Maynas y las C\u00e9dulas que se expedieron en 1805 acerca de los limites'' (\"File on the erection of the Diocese of Maynas and the Decrees that were issued in 1805 regarding the borders\"). With no response forthcoming, a Decree of the Courts rendered the Decree of 1802 null and void on November 13, 1812.\n* September 13, 1813: the ''Real C\u00e9dula de 1813'' was issued to replace the 1802 decree, in its first article ordering \"''entregar al Ordinario las nuevas Reducciones y Doctrinas que tuviesen mas de 10 a\u00f1os de antiguedad, provey\u00e9ndose en eclesi\u00e1sticos seculares, conforme a las Leyes del Patronato.

This mean that 60 villages were without a parish and almost all the missions were abandoned. Sanchez Rangel had written in 1813: \"''Desde que salieron los jesuitas de estas tierras no ha habido quien se contraiga a su fomento espiritual ni temporal; todos se han buscado a s\u00ed mismos.

On August 7 of that year, the independence of what is now [[Colombia]] was won in the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]. The independence of [[Venezuela]] was won on June 24, 1821 in the [[Battle of Carabobo]]. One of Bolivar's generals, Venezuelan-born General [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] won the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822 and freed the territory that was then Ecuador.\n\nGran Colombia comprised what is now [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and\n[[Panama]]. It was Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's dream to unite all of South America, a project which he would never achieve.\n\nEven before the battles for the freedom of the South American colonies were over, Bolivar established the ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' principle as the basis for the territorial demarcation of the new nation-states that were to be born out of the ancient colonial jurisdictions. In essence, the principle stated that the borders of the new countries should correspond to the Spanish administrative borders, as they were in 1809. By this principle, the territory of the ''Viceroyalty of Peru'' would become the Republic of Peru (modern Peru), and the territory of the ''Viceroyalty of New Granada'' would become the Republic of Colombia (Greater Colombia, which included modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama). Border disputes arose when Peru began basing its borders on the Cedula Real of 1802 which gave them rights to claim territory in the Amazon region and the C\u00e9dula of 1803 which gave Peru the right to claim Guayaquil and the coast of Ecuador. Colombia claims that both Cedulas are do not change political borders because the Cedula of 1802 refers only to Ecclesiastical borders and the 1803 cedula deals with mercantile and military jurisdictions.  Gran Colombia basis its borders on the unmodified C\u00e9dula of 1740 to define its borders with Peru.\n\n* '''July 6, 1822: Monteagudo-Mosquera Treaty'''\n\n:Mosquera's mission to Lima had two objectives: (1) To come up with a treaty of alliance between Gran Colombia and Peru against Spain, and (2) To have Peru recognize that [[Guayaquil]] was to be part of Gran Colombia. Monteagudo initially refused to give up [[Guayaquil]] without first having the people of that city express their will voluntarily. The treaty was signed, nonetheless, but precise territorial demarcation was left for a later treaty .

Peruvian President [[Jos\u00e9 de la Mar]], who had been a member of Bolivar's troops during the wars of independence and born in Cuenca, Ecuador, had his own political ambition. De La Mar wanted to establish himself as the formal ruler of Peru which in precolonial times was called Inca Empire which included Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. Because of De La Mars ambition of restoring the glory of the Inca Empire by annexing Ecuador and Bolivia to Peru, relations between Bolivar and De la Mar quickly boiled over and the two soon became rivals.\n\nDeciding to free Peru (what is now Peru and Bolivia) from what he considered to be an authoritarian project, De la Mar promoted an anti-Bolivarian campaign which gained popular support and led to insurrections, both in Peru and in Bolivia (Alto Per\u00fa), where the Colombian Army was expelled. Finally, he decided to confront Bolivar more directly by launching an attack. On June 3, 1828, de la Mar invaded the southern region of Gran Colombia; he occupied [[Loja Province|Loja]] and tried to capture [[Guayas Province|Guayas]], and intended to annex those territories to Peru.\n\nFurious upon hearing the news, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar resolved to declare war against Peru. Sucre was appointed Commander of the Colombian Army. In 1829, De la Mar and General [[Agustin Gamarra]] occupied Cuenca, but were defeated in what is known as the Battle of Portete de Tarqui (also known as the [[Battle of Tarqui]]) by Sucre on February 27, 1829. A coup supported by General Gamarra in the Peruvian Army against President De la Mar paved the way for a peace treaty. Subsequently, the ''Convenio de Gir\u00f3n'' between Peru and Gran Colombia recognizes as borders the \"same ones of the corresponding Viceroyalties before independence.\" On July 10, the ''Piura Armistice'' recognised the annexation of [[Guayaquil]] to Gran Colombia, and on September 22, the war between Peru and Gran Colombia formally ended.

The ''uti possidetis'' principle was ratified, allowing for small concessions with the end of coming up with a more natural and precise border so as to avoid further conflict. The parties agreed to form a binational commission to establish a permanent border. [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/exteriores/Libroweb/cap2.htm]\n\nThe Gran Colombia federation dissolved during 1830 because of political struggles between regions which strengthened after Bolivar's resignation. Ecuador was born as a country on May 13, 1830 and began its separate existence with the adoption of a Constitution on September 23, 1830. According to this constitution, the [[Republic of Ecuador]] was composed of the provinces of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] and [[Quito]]. These provinces later divided into the many provinces that exist today in Ecuador.\n\n===Confusion about Gran Colombia===\nThe term Gran Colombia is used today to refer to the federation that was formed between the Republics of Ecuador, Colombia (with Panama) and Venezuela before 1830. However, ''Gran Colombia'' is an anachronistic term, as the country was simply referred to as ''Colombia'', which is clear, for example, by looking at original documentation of the many treaties signed between ''Colombia'' and Peru before 1830.\n\nIn Peru, the dissolution of Gran Colombia is seen as a country ceasing to exist, giving way to the formation of new nation states that had nothing to do with the original federation. The significant implication of this view is that the treaties Peru had signed with Gran Colombia were voided, as the country in question no longer existed, and was replaced with three new states, the [[Republic of New Granada]] (which subsequently changed its name to Republic of Colombia), the Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Ecuador.\n\nAn alternative view is that Ecuador and Venezuela separated from the Gran Colombia Federation (from Colombia in actuality) and inherited any treaties that Gran Colombia had signed with Peru as they applied to their corresponding territories. There are indications that Colombia itself maintained this position. On the surface, it seems far-fetched that the Republic of Colombia after 1830 is a different country from the Republic of Colombia before 1830, even though they shared a capital city, a subset of territory and much of their citizenry. Additionally, the argument that border treaties are voided when federations are dissolved does not appear to have substantial merit and is clearly conflict-prone.{{Original research inline|date=October 2007}}\n\n===The Piedemonte-Mosquera Protocol===\nEcuador and Colombia maintain that the Piedemonte-Mosquera Protocol was signed in [[Lima]] on August 11, 1830 by Peru and Gran Colombia as a result of the Battle of Portete de Tarqui. The protocol settled the eastern section of the disputed border from the Andes Mountains to Brazil by making the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]] and [[Amazon River]] the new border between the two republics. The protocol settled the western section of the border from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean by making the Macar\u00e1 river and the [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] river the new boundary. However, it left the status of a small area in the Andes Mountains named Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros in dispute. It was decided by Pedemonte and Mosquera that on a later date, either the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River would be chosen as the new boundary.\n\nEcuador has used this protocol as primary legal support of its core claims throughout the history of the conflict. Peru has disputed the credibility and the existence of the Piedemonte-Mosquera protocol on several points:\n\n* The original document has not been produced either by Colombia or Ecuador.\n* Piedemonte and Mosquera were believed to be at different locations on the day in question.\n* The protocol was never ratified by either country's congress.\n* Even if the protocol took place, Ecuador had separated from the Gran Colombia Federation a month before the signing of the protocol&nbsp;\u2013 August 11, 1830.\n* The copy produced by Colombia is not sufficient evidence for Peru.\n\nEven though it seems unlikely that Ecuador would have concocted a historical treaty of this nature, the fact that the existence of the original document cannot be demonstrated conclusively is significant.\n\nEcuador has managed to produce a copy made in 1870 that the Colombian embassy in Lima sent to [[Bogot\u00e1]]. The copy in question was obtained from someone's personal collection. However, it was not certified by Peru and remains disputed.\n\nThe Piedemonte-Mosquera protocol is mentioned in a Colombian document titled Legislative Act No. 3 published October 31, 1910.

The disputed territories (triangular in shape) at that time was disputed between Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and covered everything east of the Andes mountains and everything in between the Caquet\u00e1-Japur\u00e1 river and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n-Amazon river.\n\n* '''March 10, 1853: Creation of the Peruvian Government of Loreto'''\n:To justify its claims to the disputed amazonian territory Peru decides to create a separate amazonian political military government naming it the Government of Loreto, after Peru successfully takes over a small amazonian port called Nauta. The policy of the Loreto Government is to concentrate on exploring, taking over, and settling these vacant areas with Peruvian citizens before Ecuador and Colombia, thus having a good de facto position if the dispute goes to arbitration. Before 1890, the fluvial armada concentrated in taking over the small river ports along the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river like Nauta, Omaguas, Iquitos, Regis, Parinari, Antonio, Santander, Barrabca, Borja, Mazan, and Destacamento. Most of the exploration of the tributary rivers north of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river was conducted by a Peruvian military commander named Coronel Pedro Portillo in the early 20th century. The Peruvian fluvial armada at that time consisted of lightly armed rafts and boats with its main base in Iquitos, the capital of Loreto. In this way most of the northern tributary rivers which drained into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n&nbsp;\u2013 Amazon river and its adjacent disputed territories were occupied by Peruvians.\n\n==The Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u20131860==\n\n{{main|Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u20131860}}\n\nThis was an expensive war fought over disputed territory bordering the Amazon. On September 21, 1857 Ecuador decided to adjudicate to Britain territories in the ''Canelos'' region as payment for international debt it had incurred during the war of independence. Peru immediately protested the Ecuadorian action citing the ''uti possidetis juris'' principle by which the ''Canelos'' region would belong to Peru, based on the territorial concession of 1802 to the ''Viceroyalty of Peru''. Despite Peruvian complaints, Ecuador proceeded in its negotiations with the British. This led to an 1859 occupation and blockade of [[Guayaquil]] by President Castilla. (Ecuador at the time was undergoing a civil struggle.) On February 25, 1860, Peruvian minister Manuel Morales and his Ecuadorian counterpart, Nicol\u00e1s Estrada, signed the ''Treaty of Mapasingue'' in order to end the dispute. (Mapasingue is a location near Guayaquil where Peruvian troops had been stationed.) Ecuador voided the concession of territories claimed by Peru to the British, and Peru withdrew its forces. However, the territorial situation remained unclear and was left to be resolved at a later time.\n\n==1860\u20131941==\n\n* '''1864: Peruvian Navy establishes presence in Iquitos'''\n:Steamships of the Peruvian Navy arrived at Iquitos, first the ''Morona'' and ''Pastaza'' of 500 and 300 tons, and then two smaller steamboats of 50 tons, the ''Napo'' and the ''Putumayo''.

Ecuador alleged that the King was not impartial because the officially undisclosed decision was not favorable. Additionally, there were popular protests in Ecuador against Peru. The King subsequently abstained from issuing a decision. Arbitration documents confirmed Peru's right to Maynas and other lands in dispute. [http://abyayala.nativeweb.org/ecuador/border/border1.html] Ecuador's position was that arbitration did not arrive at a satisfactory conclusion because even Peru's representative had expressed that the King did not have the capacity to consolidate peace, as both countries were parting from absolutely opposing principles.

The treaty signed by Pablo Herrera and Arturo Garc\u00eda gave, dominion and access to the Amazon river, the [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]] rivers, and control over parts of the provinces of [[Tumbes Province|Tumbes]] and [[Maynas Province, Peru|Maynas]], and the ''Canelos'' [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/exteriores/Libroweb/cap5.htm].

Then starting around 75\u00b0W Longitude the border followed a somewhat straight line midway between the Putumayo and Napo rivers until it reaches the Ampiyacu River, which was picked as a natural border in jungle region between Ecuador and Colombia. The border then followed the Ambiyacu River and ended when it reached 72\u00b0W Longitude on the Amazon River. With this treaty Ecuador gave up a portion of its ancient colonial claims to a territory that reached north to the Caqueta River and east to the Brazilian border.\n* '''June 21, 1924: Ponce-Castro Oyangurin Protocol'''\n:This is a protocol signed between Ecuador and Peru, wherein both parties agreed to send their representatives to Washington so that they could try to resolve their border disputes in an amicable manner through a direct negotiation compromise method followed by a partial arbitration by the President of the United States. The meetings commenced September 30, 1935, and lasted two years. From the start the President of the United States was asked not to interfere with the direct negotiations by the Peruvian delegation, since his duty would be to arbitrate a final solution based on these direct negotiations if said negotiations failed. During that time period neither party seemed to agree on defining the boundaries of the disputed area to arbitrate by the President of the United States. In essence, Ecuador considered all of Tumbez, Ja\u00e9n, and Maynas to be Ecuadorian because of its numerous de jure colonial titles, but was willing to divide them up through a compromise negotiation method for the sake of peace. In contrast, Peru considered Tumbez, Ja\u00e9n, and Maynas to be all Peruvian because of their de facto occupation and the real cedula of 1802 title, and showed up in Washington to only negotiate what the borders of these provinces were in relation to Ecuador. Because of the failure to agree on what lands were disputed, the conference in Washington was doomed to failure. Finally, on February 6, 1937 Ecuador proposed a transactional line similar to the Herrera-Garcia Treaty for arbitration and asked for complete arbitration by the President of the United States if this is rejected. Peru promptly rejected this the next day and later the Peruvian Delegation passed a note to the Ecuadorian Delegation, which informed them that they had just received instructions from their government in Peru to abandon the negotiations. Because of this the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was not able to put a final solution to the border dispute through a peaceful arbitration.\n* '''July 6, 1936: Ulloa-Viteri Accord'''\n:This agreement established a [[status quo]] border line based on the effective possession of territory that each country had in the Amazon region at the time. This border was very similar to that established by the Rio de Janeiro Protocol 5 years later. To Ecuador, the status quo line simply demonstrated how much territory Peru had taken from Ecuador in the preceding century. Ecuador never considered this agreement a final treaty of borders, and continued its aspirations which were based on Gual-Larrea and Pedemonte-Mosquera.\n\n==The Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War==\n{{main|Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War}}\n\nIn 1941, the two countries went to war. As with all other such incidents, there are conflicting accounts to this day as to which side fired the first shot. Peru's version of events (notably well documented in Peruvian sources [http://www.alasdegloria.com/Sec5p1.htm][http://www.geocities.com/peruvictorsofcenepa/fap-1941.html]{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}) is that Ecuador had been making incursions into its territory since 1937 and occupied several border locations by 1940.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the President of Peru, [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]], ordered the formation of the ''North Grouping'', a military unit in charge of the ''Northern Operational Theater'', on January 11, 1941, consisting of two light divisions with three battalions each, plus four other independent battalions and three artillery batteries (one with six 105&nbsp;mm guns) (''Delgado'').\n\nIn front of these forces, the Ecuadorian Border Security command had under its orders two Army battalions, the \"Montecristi\" and the \"Cayambe\", each one consisting of around 250 troops, armed with [[Karabiner 98k|7.92&nbsp;mm Mauser]] rifles and a couple of [[ZB vz. 26|Czech 7,92&nbsp;mm ZB-26]] light machine-guns, plus two [[Vickers-Maxim]] machine-guns. There was also a \"C\u00f3rdova\" battalion, made up of around 100 troops, and a so-called \"Mariscal Sucre\" artillery battery, with 71 troops and no artillery pieces. In fact, the only artillery in the whole province of El Oro consisted of six [[Cannone da 65/17 modello 13|Italian 65&nbsp;mm]] mountain guns, sold to Ecuador as leftovers from the Great War, and almost without shells. These guns were never put into action. (''Rodr\u00edguez, 1943'').\n\nAs for anti-aircraft defenses, the Ecuadorians had only a pair of [[Breda Model 35|20&nbsp;mm Breda]] guns deployed on Puerto Bolivar, which was the only port of entry for supplies, reinforcements, and weapons to arrive to the province, by sea, from the port-city of Guayaquil. The Ecuadorian Army of 1941 had not a single warplane. (''Rodr\u00edguez, 1943'').\n\nIt is claimed that on Saturday, July 5, 1941 the [[Huaquillas]] unit of the Ecuadorian army invaded Peruvian territory, an action which originated a combat that extended across the entire [[Zarumilla]] front, up to a region known as ''Quebrada Seca''.\n\nEcuador's version of events is that Peru's invasion was an unprovoked act of aggression carried out with the explicit purpose of forcing Ecuador to sign an unfavorable treaty that would impose the status quo border line.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 by Ecuador's Foreign Ministry indicated that Peruvian forces had been seen advancing north towards the border; all of the Peruvian troops stationed in [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]] had left [[Zarumilla]] and those in [[Piura]] and other nearby sites were in turn advancing towards [[Zarumilla]].\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the actions of the Ecuadorian army were limited to repelling the invasion which was occurring across much of the border. [http://www.alasdegloria.com/elcomercio/elc4.htm] As support for its arguments Ecuador has repeatedly cited the obvious difference in military might between the two countries, and the lack of preparedness of its forces. It has been speculated that Peru prepared to carry out an all-out invasion and could have been simply waiting for the slightest provocation.\n\nEcuador has also cited Peru's history of conflict with its other neighbors as evidence of its belligerence. It has been pointed out, however, that these circumstances did not preclude Ecuador from attempting to lay claim to territories it still considered its own. Also, during the [[War of the Pacific]], Ecuador military occupied a portion of the disputed territories.\n\nThe much larger and better equipped Peruvian force of 13,000 men quickly overwhelmed the 1,800 Ecuadorian troops guarding the province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]]. The Peruvian army had at its disposal a battalion of armor made up of [[Panzer 38(t)|Czech tanks LTP]], with artillery and air support. (Beginning with the second third of the 20th century, Peru allegedly has one of the strongest military forces in South America, even as recently as 2005 ranked second after Brazil and stronger than Argentina [https://web.archive.org/web/20050725012911/http://americas.irc-online.org/am/165]).\n\nThe Ecuadorian president, [[Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo]], kept Ecuador's best forces in [[Quito]], for fear of his political opponents (Arroyo would later resign on May 31, 1944 after much unrest in the country). Peru carried out the first use of [[paratroops]] in combat in the [[Western Hemisphere]], dropping three paratroopers over the port-city of Puerto Bol\u00edvar (''Delgado''), one of them having been rescued by Ecuadorian fishermen when he landed on the waters of the Jambel\u00ed channel.\n\nThis attempt was largely successful in allowing a relatively easy takeover of El Oro towns, devoid by then of any Ecuadorian military presence after the short-lived ceasefire of July 26, brokered by the mediator countries (USA, Brazil and Argentina). After the ceasefire, most of the Ecuadorian troops, by now exhausted and without ammunition, left the field of battle and made their way out of El Oro, towards the city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]].\n\nThus, when Peru reopened the advance on July 29, which began with simultaneous bombings on the Ecuadorian towns of Machala, Puerto Bol\u00edvar, Pasaje, Santa Rosa, and Arenillas, plus a mission to the city of Guayaquil to drop leaflets, the Peruvian forces easily occupied the deserted towns of the province. A new ceasefire having been decreed to enter in effect on July 31 at 18h00 forced the Peruvian command to step up its efforts to occupy Machala and Puerto Bol\u00edvar, which they did with troops disembarked directly on Puerto Bol\u00edvar from the sea in the afternoon of July 31. (''Delgado'')\n\nEven then, hostilities didn't cease, as Peruvian forces began operations against the Ecuadorian posts on the Amazonian jungle, most of which were easily overrun.\n\nWith Peru occupying [[El Oro Province|El Oro]] and menacing [[Guayaquil]], plus pressure from the United States and Latin America to stop the hostilities as a sign of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis powers]] (in World War II), Peru and Ecuador signed the [[Rio de Janeiro]] Protocol.\n\n==Rio de Janeiro Protocol==\n[[Image:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the dispute {{in lang|es}}]]\n{{details|Rio Protocol}}\n\nIn May 1941, as tensions at the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border mounted and war was imminent, the governments of the United States of America, Brazil, and [[Argentina]] offered their services in aiding in the mediation of the dispute. Their efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities on July 23, 1941, but the diplomatic intervention led to a definitive cease-fire being put into place on July 31. Despite this, limited [[skirmish]]es continued to occur through the months of August and September in the Ecuadorian provinces of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]] and [[Loja Province|Loja]], as well as in the Amazonian lands. Ecuador accused Peru of continuing its advances into the highland province of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]].\n\nOn October 2, with military observers from the three mediating countries serving as witnesses, Ecuador and Peru signed the '''Talara Accord''', which created a demilitarized zone inside the provinces of El Oro and Loja, pending the signing of a definitive peace treaty. Diplomatic efforts continued, with the mediating countries being joined by [[Chile]].\n\nOn January 29, 1942, on the final day of the third Pan-American Summit, held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru, [[Julio Tobar Donoso]] and [[Alfredo Solf y Muro]], signed a \"Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries\", known as the '''Rio de Janeiro Protocol'''. The observers from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile co-signed the document, becoming \"Guarantors of the Protocol\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122235546/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |archivedate=2005-11-22 }}</ref> The Rio Protocol was subsequently ratified by each country's congress on February 26, 1942.\n\nBy the terms of the Protocol, Ecuador agreed to withdraw its long-standing claim for rights to direct land access to the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] rivers; Peru agreed to withdraw Peruvian military forces from Ecuadorian territory. An area of {{convert|200,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of hitherto disputed territory in the Maynas region of the Amazonian basin was awarded to Peru, which had been established to be the [[de facto]] possessor of the land since the end of the 19th century. The \"status quo\" line defined in the 1936 Lima Accord was used as the basis for the definitive border line; the previous border recognized current possessions, but not [[sovereignty]]. Relative to the 1936 line, Ecuador ceded 18,552&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of previously possessed territory to Peru, while Peru ceded 5,072&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of previously possessed territory to Ecuador.<ref>Julio Tobar Donoso, ''La Invasi\u00f3n Peruana y el Protocolo de Rio. Antecedentes y Explicaci\u00f3n Hist\u00f3rica''. Quito, Banco Central del Ecuador, 1982 (1st Ed. 1945). P. 462.</ref>\n\n===Ecuador's objections to the Protocol and thesis of Nullity===\n\nSix times during the demarcation technical problems were found and referred to the Guarantors, with Brazil acting as lead. One of them, which involved the then contested ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'', was submitted to arbitration by Captain Braz Dias de Aguiar. Both countries initially accepted the arbiter's award, issued July 1945, and demarcation began in the area according to that ruling.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1946 the [[United States Air Force]] performed several aerial reconnaissance missions over the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region (losing 2 aircraft and 14 men in accidents.) to help in the demarcation efforts. They found that the ''Cenepa river'' was much longer than previously thought and that it runs between the [[Zamora River|Zamora]] and the [[Santiago River (Ecuador)|Santiago]]. This finding conflicted with article VIII, point B-1 of the Rio Protocol, which laid out delineation of the border for that area as follows:\n\n:''From the Quebrada de San Francisco, the watershed between the Zamora and Santiago Rivers, to the confluence of the Santiago River with the Yaupi;''\n\nThe difficulty was that there is not one watershed between the Zamora and the Santiago, but two, as interpreted by Ecuador. This resulted in Ecuadorian president [[Galo Plaza]] halting demarcation in 1949. About 78 kilometers of border were left unmarked. In 1953 Ecuador withdrew from the Demarcation Commissions, claiming the Protocol \"impossible to implement\" in that area.\n\nOn September 29, 1960 Ecuadorian president [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] declared the Rio Protocol null and void. (Peruvian analysts have speculated that this was a politically motivated move by Velasco Ibarra, who was considered a populist, but evidence to support this assertion is totally circumstantial).\n\nWith the sole exception of [[Cuba]], the American community did not approve of Ecuador's diplomatic move, with the United States sending a letter of protest to Ecuador.\n\nThe arguments for what is called Ecuador's ''thesis of nullity'' varied, but they were generally the following:\n\n* It was imposed by military force.\n* It was signed while Ecuadorian towns were under occupation; invasion and occupation of nation states are prohibited by international law.\n* International law does not accept the conquest of territory by force or violence. Even considering de facto possession (1936 status quo border line) Peru took about 14,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory.\n* There was lack of compliance by Peru in denying Ecuador free navigation in Amazonian rivers as stipulated.\n* It was a blow to the economic development of a South American country, which is contrary to existing pacts of cooperation.\n\nPeru's counter-arguments included the following:\n\n* Ecuador cannot unilaterally invalidate a protocol\n* The core argument on implementability is a demarcation issue, not a justification to invalidate the entire protocol\n* Peru disputes the notion that the protocol was imposed by ''premeditated'' military force\n* Even though the protocol was signed while Peruvian troops were still occupying El Oro for tactical reasons, the Ecuadorian congress ratified it long after Peruvian troops had left\n* Several Peruvian governments restricted the navigation clause in response to Ecuador's position on the treaty\n* On the issue of conquest of territory by force, Peru has pointed out that the disputed territories (Tumbes, Ja\u00e9n and Maynas) were not under ''de jure'' Ecuadorian administration, and that the province of El Oro was not annexed to Peru\n\nEcuador argued its thesis extensively for 30 years, but did not find support in the international community. Peru's position, on the other hand, was that a dispute did not exist at all after 1941, a position which lasted until 1995, when it was recognized as a problematic diplomatic issue.\n\nMaps published in Ecuador since the 1960s up to the end of the 20th century officially had to exclude the unmarked 78 kilometers of border, that is, the Rio Protocol line was drawn as unresolved, and to include what Ecuador considered as its own by right, according to the Pedemonte-Mosquera protocol (1830) line, which puts the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] ([[Amazon River|Amazon]]) river as the border between Peru and Ecuador.\n\nSuch controversial maps of Ecuador, known in Ecuador as \"Tufi\u00f1o's map\", were referred in Peru as ''\"mapa recortado del Peru\"'' (''cut-off map of Peru'').\n\n==The Paquisha Incident (1981)==\n{{Main|Paquisha Incident}}\nThe Paquisha War was a brief military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] over the control of three watchposts. While Peru felt that the matter had already been decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\n==The Cenepa War (1995)==\n{{Main|Cenepa War}}\nThe Cenepa War was a brief (January 26 \u2013 February 28, 1995) and localized military conflict between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], fought over control of a disputed area on the border between the two countries.  The two nations had signed a border treaty following the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1996 Ecuador declared the treaty null and void.\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the Cenepa War \u2014 both sides claimed victory \u2014 along with the mediation efforts of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and the [[United States]], paved the way for the opening of diplomatic negotiations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]) on 26 October 1998.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict, viewed on 2013-07-15, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas |date=2013-09-27 }}</ref> The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to the longest territorial dispute in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/>\n\n==1995\u20131998: Arbitration and final resolution==\n\nA cease fire was brokered by the four guarantor countries, and subsequently the ''[[Itamaraty]] Peace Declaration'' was signed on February 17, 1995. One of the declaration's clauses included the creation of the '''Military Observer Mission Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP)''' in order to verify ceasefire agreements, as well as observe and report infractions through diplomatic channels.\n\nThe MOMEP contingent was made up of observers, logistics, and aviation support from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile as part of ''Operation Safe Border''. The mission, unique in its scope, was fully funded by Peru and Ecuador. MOMEP was largely successful despite several tragic accidents due to land mines left in the area.\n\nAt a critical moment during late July and early August 1998 it appeared that Peruvian forces were preparing a preemptive assault on Ecuadorian forces (this is partially believed due to the Peruvian Air Force buying 19 Soviet-built [[MiG-29]] fighter planes and 18 [[Su-25]] attack aircraft from Belarus to counter the abysmal state the airforce was in at the beginning of the conflict, with 80% of the fleet grounded due to lack of spare parts), but the presence of the MOMEP contingent was instrumental in defusing the\nsituation.

Both countries agreed to a guarantor-sponsored technical commission composed of boundary experts in order to resolve the matter.\n\nBefore a critical meeting planned in Brazil for early 1997, both countries entered a period of unforeseen political events. In Peru, there was a hostage [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|crisis in its Japanese embassy]] involving guerrillas of the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]]. Ecuador was going through a period of political instability as\nPresident [[Abdala Bucaram]], a strong supporter of an agreement on the border issue, was removed by congress due to alleged mental incapacity. (President Bucaram, who is known for his unusual antics, had visited Peru and was seen on TV eating [[ceviche]] and wearing alpaca hoods\u2014a traditional indigenous outfit\u2014along with President [[Alberto Fujimori]].)\n\nThese delays nevertheless gave the guarantors more time to come up with a solution to the dispute. Eventually they concluded that a resolution would not be possible without granting something to each party.\n\nThe commission recognized Ecuador's position on one small already demarcated section of the border, and Peru's position on the larger issue of the single watershed between the Zamora and Santiago rivers. The latter was a blow to Ecuador's historic position, and left [[Tiwintza Canton|Tiwintza]] in Peruvian territory.\n\nThe solution that the commission reached was that an area of one square kilometer in the place of the fiercest struggle, Tiwinza, on the Peruvian side of the border, would be granted to Ecuador as a non-sovereign private property. The site could be used by Ecuador for commemorative and non-military events. Everyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian. Although none of the countries was completely satisfied with the solution, both accepted it, which was a significant diplomatic success.\n\nThe resolution also called for the creation of two national parks contiguous to one another (also referred to as a ''binational park'') in the ''Cordillera del Condor'' region.\n\nAmbassador Luigi Einaudi, the US guarantor representative, is credited with coming up with the idea of a private property concession in Tiwintza, working almost full-time on the problem, and coming up with ways to express issues in a manner not offensive to either party.

Formal demarcation of border regions started on May 13, 1999. The agreement was ratified without opposition by both nations' congress. U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] said: \"This signing marks the end of the last and longest running source of armed international conflict in the Western hemisphere\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/201442.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peru and Ecuador sign border treaty | date=October 27, 1998 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Political, social and economic impact==\nThis dispute is unique and significant in the study of causes and resolution of international conflict. Ecuador and Peru are populated by people who share a language, a culture, a religious preference, have basically the same social and ethnic diversity, and comparable economic difficulties. They are also both democracies (for the most part in modern times) which puts in doubt the common contention that [[Democratic peace theory|democracies never go to war with each other]].\n\n===Education and public perception===\n\nA 2000 study carried out as part of the educational ''ASA Program'' found teaching curriculum relating to the dispute to be extremely one-sided in both countries:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8ung.at/griesse/spanisch/themen/peru-ec/informe.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901055338/http://www.8ung.at/griesse/spanisch/themen/peru-ec/informe.pdf |archivedate=2005-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n* Notably, in Ecuador the dispute is a central issue in the study of Ecuador's borders. (Traditionally there has been a course named \"''History of Borders''.\")\n* In Peru, the educational system does not give as much importance to the dispute with Ecuador, and is part of the course ''\"Peruvian History\"''. In contrast, the only topic related to the territorial dispute that is normally taught is the '''Rio Protocol''', and its importance in the settlement of this dispute.\n\nMany examples of bias are cited, which can typically be characterized as removal of critical information about the other side's position. Emotional and nationalistic coloring of the material also appears to be routine. Although expected under the circumstances, this has likely fed the cycle of conflict in the past.\n\nCitizens of Ecuador and Peru feel both their countries have lost territory over time. The issue is one of overlapping maximalist territorial claims and aspirations.\n\nHigh Peruvian military spending is seen by Ecuador as evidence of belligerence and expansionism. Peru also considers Ecuador belligerent and expansionist.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century things appear to have improved considerably. The '''[[Cenepa War]]''' of 1995 allowed an honorable resolution of the conflict without a clear winner. To many Ecuadorians this was viewed as restoring the honor of the country, which was at least as important as their claims to the disputed territory. Unfortunately, not everyone is completely satisfied.\n\nToday, the entire Ecuadorian-Peruvian border is clearly delimited and demarcated, and the maps of both countries agree on the location of the common frontier. Bilateral work is being done by both countries Foreign Affairs officers to consolidate the economic and social integration. We can see part of this done by the Peruvian government with their Consulate in Machala, El Oro, where Minister [[Efrain Saavedra]] is the Consul General.\n\n===Economic impact===\nOne of the concerns both countries have had is the impact of the dispute on foreign investment. Thomas McLarty, US envoy at the resolution talks and former aid to President [[Bill Clinton]], has said peace is essential to South America's economic recovery. He added: \"You clearly cannot have long-term growth and prosperity involving foreign investment without stability\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/201442.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peru and Ecuador sign border treaty | date=October 27, 1998}}</ref> While there are still political instability issues in the region, resolution of the territorial conflict is helpful.\n\nTrade between both countries has benefited considerably. Before signing the peace treaty, annual trade between Peru and Ecuador was about 100 million dollars. But as early as 1998, it had increased 5-fold.<ref>http://www.fujimorialberto.com/index.php?selection=artAll&articleId=1038</ref>\n\nThere was also a broad agreement of integration between both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/Seminar-Lima/cabezas_lima_e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427063628/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/Seminar-Lima/cabezas_lima_e.htm |archivedate=2005-04-27 }}</ref><ref>http://planbinacional.rree.gob.pe/domino/nsf/planbinacional.nsf/0/B773348FF71A8F9C05256F5D007779A0?OpenDocument{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It included a binational fund for peace and development, national plans for productive, social and environmental development, and so on.\n\n===Political implications===\nAccording to Gabriel Marcella ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|US Department of National Security and Strategy]]), as a result of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute \"a number of emerging views about international affairs, U.S. foreign policy, and modern inter-American affairs were either shattered or seriously challenged\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/research_pubs/amazon.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219214209/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/research_pubs/amazon.pdf |archive-date=2006-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of the global and regional political implications of the dispute which have been noted are the following:\n\n* It was a blow to the idea that democracies do not go to war with one another. An armed conflict between these two nations has existed well before then, nevertheless, on and off with major confrontations occurring in 1941, 1981 and 1995. Ecuador and Peru have both been full-fledged democracies for the most part in modern times, although of course not perfect or politically stable.\n* It was a blow to the idea that Latin America is a model for peaceful international relations. It is a reminder that there are other territorial disputes and conflicting claims among other Latin American countries which could potentially threaten peace in the region.\n* Civil-military relations in both countries have been impacted and need to be reexamined. If in fact the conflict was allowed to escalate after accidental encounters between patrols, it has been suggested that the civilian authority should perhaps assume more solid leadership and control.\n* The principle that territorial treaties in Latin America are not the result of force or violence needs to be reexamined as a result.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dispute resolution]]\n* [[Territorial dispute]]\n* [[Paquisha Incident]]\n* General [[Richelieu Levoyer]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references group=\"Notes\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9YA-AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s\n|title=A study of the question of boundaries between the republics of Peru and Ecuador\n|last1=Santamar\u00eda de Paredes\n|first1=Vicente\n|last2=Weston Van Dyke\n|first2=Harry\n|publisher= Press of B.S.

This dispute was a consequence of each country's interpretation of what Real Cedulas (Royal Proclamations) Spain used to precisely define its colonial territories in the Americas. After independence, all of Spain's colonial territories signed and agreed to proclaim their limits in the basis of the principle ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' which accepts the Spanish colonial borders of 1810 as the borders of the new republics. Thus the borders of Gran Colombia which included Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela would follow the borders of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], and Peru the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] in 1810. However, Peru was not satisfied with this and tried to set the date of her Uti Possitedis to 1824- a time when Peru was officially independent with territories Peru militarily occupied since 1820. \n\nTumbes and Jaen de Bracamoros, to which Peru had no colonial titles, were territories that declared their independence in 1820 and were militarily occupied by Peruvian patriot forces that convinced the people in these territories to join Peru. Because of this, Peru claims that part of its western territorial borders where it lacks title is derived from free determination of its people in the border areas after independence. In the eastern section known as Maynas or Mainas, which was the sparsely inhabited and entirely Amazon Basin, Peru bases its legal claims on the disputed Real Cedula of 1802 by which the Government of Maynas and the Government of Quijos, as well as the missions established in the rivers that flow into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, which belonged until then to the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, passed to the political and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\nFrom the content of this Real Cedula it is clear that its main objective was to stop the Portuguese advances to the territories of the Spanish crown. [[Gran Colombia]] which declared independence 2 years earlier in 1819 and helped [[Spanish American wars of independence|Peruvian independence war]] in the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn|battles of Jun\u00edn]] and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] bases its rights on the clear Real Cedulas of 1717, 1739 and 1740 and declares that the Real Cedula of 1802 is not political in nature, but was meant only for ecclesiastical and military jurisdiction, so also Peru bases in the clear Real Cedula of 1803 which ordered the incorporation of the province of Guayaquil to the Viceroyalty of Peru in which the two viceroys immediately proceeded to comply with the royal order and in fact and in law, Guayaquil became part of the viceroyalty of Lima.\n\nDuring the first 10 years of independence, Gran Colombia, under the leadership of [[Simon Bolivar]], had continually protested Peru's occupation of Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n; Maynas had not been militarily occupied yet. Peru ignored Bol\u00edvar's ultimatum to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n or face war. Bol\u00edvar then declared war and Peru responded by successfully invading and occupying southern Ecuador with a force of 8,000 soldiers. Bolivar sent Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sucre to Ecuador who lead 4,000 Gran Colombian soldiers that defeated the Peruvian invaders in the Battle of Tarqui in 1829. The Treaty of Giron ended the war and the Treaty of Guayaquil in 1829 more or less restated the borders of Uti Possidetis juris of 1810 with slight modification in favor of Peru to form a clear border. Negotiations known as protocolized conferences began and Gran Colombia ceded some of its territory for the sake of peace and to have river borders to avoid future disputes. During these conferences both parties agreed that in the west the borders should follow the rivers Tumbes, but that either the Huancabamba or the Chinchipe would be decided later. In the east both agreed to divide Maynas in half and that both republics would be separated entirely by the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Amazon rivers until the border reaches Brazil. On August 10, 1830 a treaty was signed known as the Protocolo de Mosquera-Pedimonte which summarized the results of the protocolized conferences. This treaty was to end the border conflict once and for all, however, Ecuador split from Gran Colombia and thus the ones who signed the treaty did not have any negotiating powers. When Peru found out that Ecuador had seceded from Gran Colombia it decided to retain Ja\u00e9n and Tumbes in the west and to slowly invade the Amazon Basin north of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river.\n\nWhen the Republic of Ecuador proclaimed its [[secession]] from Gran Colombia in 1830 its government negotiated a swap of territories in the Amazon basin for debt with the British creditors, and the dispute over the territories re-ignited in 1857. Peru implemented a maritime [[blockade]] of the port of [[Guayaquil]] demanding a revocation of the deal, as well as an acknowledgment of Peruvian sovereignty over the disputed territories. These demands went unheeded and with Ecuador in a state of civil war, the government of [[Guillermo Franco (Ecuadorian general)|Guillermo Franco]] in the province of Guayaquil, claiming to represent the entire country, agreed to Peru's demands and signed the Treaty of [[Mapasingue]] of 1860. [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]]'s provisional government won the civil war later that year, and voided this treaty, with the new Peruvian government following suit several years later.\n\nThe dispute continued through the late 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Numerous attempts were made to define the borders, but both governments could not come to an agreement acceptable to their constituencies. A [[Colombia\u2013Peru War|war between Colombia and Peru]] occurred during 1932 and 1933 in the Eastern region of the Amazon territories and resulted in the official designation of the [[Putumayo River]] as a border between Colombia and Peru; but sectors of the society considered this detrimental to the Ecuadorian cause, with Colombia now recognizing Peru's rights to the territory that Ecuador claimed as its own. An agreement recognizing territories in ''[[de facto]]'' possession by each country was signed in 1936, but minor military skirmishes began to occur in 1938. Tensions escalated, and [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|war broke out in July 1941]], and officially came to an end with the signing of the [[Rio Protocol|Rio de Janeiro Protocol]] on January 29, 1942.  The treaty was intended to finally bring the long-running territorial dispute to an end, but in 1960 the then-president of Ecuador Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa Velasco Ibarra proposed to the Congress a thesis of nullity based in the fact that the 1942 protocol was forced upon the Ecuadorian government under duress.\n\nA brief military clash took place in early 1981, when the [[Peruvian Army]] forcefully took control of three Ecuadorian military outposts on the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] mountain range. An agreement in 1992 between the presidents of the two countries promised to seek peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, in December 1994, the Ecuadorian army was seen to be mobilizing in the vicinity of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor. On January 26, 1995, [[Cenepa War|war broke out]] over control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the [[Cenepa River]], within a 78-kilometer strip of territory that both countries claimed as their own. In this case, the result was favorable for Peru who succeeded in taking all the Ecuadorian outposts set in Peruvian territory, although Ecuador caused some casualties. The fighting came to an end after just over one month, with the signing of the Montevideo Declaration on February 28, and the later signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration under the supervision of the guarantors of the Rio Protocol of 1942: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S.\n\nTensions subsided but persisted over the next three years. On October 26, 1998, Ecuador and Peru signed a comprehensive peace accord that established a framework for ending a border dispute. Formal demarcation of border regions started on May 13, 1999. The agreement was ratified without opposition by the congresses of both nations, finally bringing an end to the dispute, almost two centuries after the South American nations (or their predecessors) claimed their independence from the Spanish Crown.\n\n==Colonial period==\n{{Main|Viceroyalty of Peru}}\n\n===Spanish conquest and establishment of the Viceroyalty of Peru===\nBeginning with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, the Spanish [[conquistadores]] expanded the range of the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown's]] reach from early small settlements in the Caribbean to various continental territories, eventually including [[Central America]] and most of South America.\n\nThe Spaniards arrived at the borders of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1528, and on November 16, 1532, taking advantage of the [[Inca Civil War]], the tiny army of [[Francisco Pizarro]] began the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]]. In the following decades, Spain consolidated its power over the entire Andean region, repressing successive indigenous rebellions.\n\nTo govern the new territories of Spain, in 1542 [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (King Charles I of Spain) created two [[Viceroyalty|Viceroyalties]], the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (in modern-day [[Mexico]]) and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (a.k.a. the Viceroyalty of New Castile). In 1542, King Charles named [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] Peru's first viceroy, but the viceroyalty was not organized until the arrival of Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa|Francisco de Toledo]] in 1572. Toledo promptly declared war on [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], the last refuge of the Inca; soon afterwards, [[Tupac Amaru]], the last Inca emperor, was captured and executed in [[Cuzco]].\n\n===Territorial division of the Viceroyalty of Peru===\n[[File:Audencias of Viceroyalty of Peru.PNG|thumb|right|Territorial divisions of the Viceroyalty of Peru as described by the laws compiled in the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n'' of 1680.]]\nBecause the territory of the Viceroyalty of Peru was so large, and far away from centers of government in [[Real Audiencia of Lima|Lima]] and [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], Peru (as well as New Spain) was divided into a number of ''real [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s'' (royal audiences), a type of superior judicial tribunal that combined executive and judicial authority, and can be considered \"major [[province]]s\". The audiences controlled the ''gobernaciones'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the civil, as distinguished from the military, branch of the colonial governmental entities lesser in extent than the audiencias.\" (1910)</ref> ''alcaldias mayores'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the jurisdiction of the ''Alcalde mayor'', who, as mayor, governed a town of lesser importance than the capital of a province.\" (1910)</ref> ''corregimientos'',<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"the district governed by a ''Corregidor'', a correctional magistrate, who, in colonial times, exercised administrative functions over a district. (1910)</ref> and ''alcaldias ordinarias''.<ref group=\"Notes\">Defined as \"jurisdiction of the ''Alcalde ordinario'', who was similar to the alcaldia mayor, but of lesser extent. (1910)</ref> The territory was also divided [[ecclesiastical]]ly, into archbishoprics, religious provinces, suggragan bishopries, parishes and curateships. The archbishoprics and religious provinces corresponded with the audiences, the bishoprics with the ''gobernaciones'' and ''alcaldias mayores'', and the parishes and curateships with the ''corregimientos'' and ''alcaldias ordinarias''.<ref name=1910eight>Paredes-Van Dyke p.8.</ref>\n\nThese civil divisions were not uniform, with numerous exceptions being made based on the specific circumstances.  The Viceroys were presidents of the audiences at the capitals of their Viceroyalties, with other audiences being presided over by captains-generals, or by persons known as gowned presidents. Power was devolved to the captains-general of an audience by the Viceroy, and the audience's territory was administered by the audience's president and the political, military, and religious officials underneath him.<ref name=1910eight/>\n\nBetween 1542 and 1717, the Viceroyalty controlled most of the territory of South America (save for a few non-Spanish colonies and the Commandancy General of [[Caracas]], which was a dependency of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]). The territory was divided among (noting dates of creation):\n\n#[[Real Audiencia of Panam\u00e1|Royal Audience of Tierra Firme]] (1564)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1|Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (1548)\n#[[Royal Audience of Quito|Royal Audience of San Francisco of Quito]] (1563)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Lima|Royal Audience of the City of Kings Lima]] (1543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Royal Audience of La Plata de los Charcas]] (1559)\n#[[Royal Audiencia of Concepci\u00f3n|Royal Audience of Chile]] (1563\u20131573; 1606)\n\nThe district of an audience was established in the royal decree by which it was created; the laws laid out in the myriad of ''C\u00e9dulas Reales'' issued by the Spanish Crown were compiled several times throughout the centuries-long history of Spanish presence in the region. These compilations were referred to as the [[Laws of the Indies]]; the 1680 compilation, organized under Charles II, known as the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n de las Leyes de los Reynos de Indias'' (Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies), set a template by which the laws were organized.\n\nUnder Title XV of Book II of the ''Recopilaci\u00f3n'', the limits of the audiences of Lima and Quito were defined as follows:\n\n{{quotebox|width=100%|align=left|\n*The district of the '''Royal Audience of San Francisco of Quito''' was described in Law X, Title XV of Book II: \"In the City of [[Quito|San Francisco of Quito]], in Peru, shall reside another Royal Audience and Chancellery of ours, with a president; four judges of [[Private law|civil cases]] [''oidores''], who will also be judges of [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] [''alcaldes del crimen'']; a crown attorney [''fiscal'']; a bailiff [''alguacil mayor'']; a lieutenant of the Gran Chancellor; and the other necessary ministers and officials; and which shall have for district the Province of Quito, and along the coast towards the [[Lima|Ciudad de los Reyes]] [Lima] to the Port of [[Paita]], exclusive; and inland towards [[Piura]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]], [[Moyobamba]] and [[Huallaga River|Motilones]], exclusive, including towards the aforesaid part the towns of [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]], [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador|Valladolid]], [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]], [[Zamora, Ecuador|Zamora]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador|La Zarza]] and [[Guayaquil]], with the rest of the towns, which are in their districts or will be founded [in them]; and towards the towns of [[La Canela]] and [[Quijos Canton|Quijos]], it should include said towns and the rest that shall be discovered; and along the coast towards [[Panama]], until the [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Port of Buenaventura]], inclusive; and inland to [[Pasto (Colombia)|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], Chapanchinca and Guarchicona; because the rest of the places of the Government (''Gobernaci\u00f3n'') of Popay\u00e1n are of the Audience of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], with which, and with the one of [[Tierra Firma|Tierrafirme]] [Panama], it shall share a border on the north; and with the one of Los Reyes in the south; having for its western border the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]] [Pacific Ocean] and eastern the provinces still not yet pacified nor discovered.\"<ref name=\"p.56 1910\">p.56 (1910)</ref><ref name=title15>{{Cite book| author = Spain|title = Recopilaci\u00f3n de las Leyes de Indias.

In October 1777 the Treaty of San Idelfonso was signed, recognizing the rivers [[Japur\u00e1 River|Japur\u00e1]] and [[Javary River|Javary]] as the border with Portugal, leaving some sectors without exact delimitation. Spain sent Francisco de Requena on a scientific expedition to learn the geography of the region in order to clarify the territorial limits; after nine years, following disagreements with the counterpart Portuguese commission, de Requena left the region, leaving the border situation unresolved.\n*De Requena's remaining in Lima with aspirations of being named Viceroy of Peru, and his desire that [[Maynas Province|Maynas]] become part of the Viceroyalty, according to his report to the King of Spain.\n*Francisco de Requena's report furthered the interests of Peru, which wanted to assist the College of Ocopa Jesuit religious congregation in recolonizing the eastern Upper [[Ucayali]] region from which they had been previously expelled. -->\n\n==1803\u20131818==\n\n*1803: A similar event occurred in 1803, when it was decided that the military affairs of the Province of Guayaquil (whose capital was the strategically situated port city of [[Guayaquil]]) would be run from Lima.\n* 1810: all administrative and economic affairs of the province were turned over to the Viceroyalty of Peru, a state of affairs that would endure until 1819. Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros had no such cedula transferring it to Peru and would rightly belong to Ecuador. However, Ja\u00e9n decided to join Peru after it took part in northern Peru's revolutionary wars of independence.\n* September 28, 1812: the Council of Regency requested from Madrid the ''Expediente sobre la erecci\u00f3n del Obispado de Maynas y las C\u00e9dulas que se expedieron en 1805 acerca de los limites'' (\"File on the erection of the Diocese of Maynas and the Decrees that were issued in 1805 regarding the borders\"). With no response forthcoming, a Decree of the Courts rendered the Decree of 1802 null and void on November 13, 1812.\n* September 13, 1813: the ''Real C\u00e9dula de 1813'' was issued to replace the 1802 decree, in its first article ordering \"''entregar al Ordinario las nuevas Reducciones y Doctrinas que tuviesen mas de 10 a\u00f1os de antiguedad, provey\u00e9ndose en eclesi\u00e1sticos seculares, conforme a las Leyes del Patronato.

This mean that 60 villages were without a parish and almost all the missions were abandoned. Sanchez Rangel had written in 1813: \"''Desde que salieron los jesuitas de estas tierras no ha habido quien se contraiga a su fomento espiritual ni temporal; todos se han buscado a s\u00ed mismos.

On August 23, the Viceroy acknowledges the Royal Order of 1816, returning the province of Maynas to Quito.\n\n==Independence from Spain==\nThe [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] was founded in 1819, with [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] as President. On August 7 of that year, the independence of what is now [[Colombia]] was won in the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]. The independence of [[Venezuela]] was won on June 24, 1821 in the [[Battle of Carabobo]]. One of Bolivar's generals, Venezuelan-born General [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] won the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822 and freed the territory that was then Ecuador.\n\nGran Colombia comprised what is now [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and\n[[Panama]]. It was Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's dream to unite all of South America, a project which he would never achieve.\n\nEven before the battles for the freedom of the South American colonies were over, Bolivar established the ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' principle as the basis for the territorial demarcation of the new nation-states that were to be born out of the ancient colonial jurisdictions. In essence, the principle stated that the borders of the new countries should correspond to the Spanish administrative borders, as they were in 1809. By this principle, the territory of the ''Viceroyalty of Peru'' would become the Republic of Peru (modern Peru), and the territory of the ''Viceroyalty of New Granada'' would become the Republic of Colombia (Greater Colombia, which included modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama). Border disputes arose when Peru began basing its borders on the Cedula Real of 1802 which gave them rights to claim territory in the Amazon region and the C\u00e9dula of 1803 which gave Peru the right to claim Guayaquil and the coast of Ecuador. Colombia claims that both Cedulas are do not change political borders because the Cedula of 1802 refers only to Ecclesiastical borders and the 1803 cedula deals with mercantile and military jurisdictions.  Gran Colombia basis its borders on the unmodified C\u00e9dula of 1740 to define its borders with Peru.\n\n* '''July 6, 1822: Monteagudo-Mosquera Treaty'''\n\n:Mosquera's mission to Lima had two objectives: (1) To come up with a treaty of alliance between Gran Colombia and Peru against Spain, and (2) To have Peru recognize that [[Guayaquil]] was to be part of Gran Colombia. Monteagudo initially refused to give up [[Guayaquil]] without first having the people of that city express their will voluntarily. The treaty was signed, nonetheless, but precise territorial demarcation was left for a later treaty .

Peruvian President [[Jos\u00e9 de la Mar]], who had been a member of Bolivar's troops during the wars of independence and born in Cuenca, Ecuador, had his own political ambition. De La Mar wanted to establish himself as the formal ruler of Peru which in precolonial times was called Inca Empire which included Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. Because of De La Mars ambition of restoring the glory of the Inca Empire by annexing Ecuador and Bolivia to Peru, relations between Bolivar and De la Mar quickly boiled over and the two soon became rivals.\n\nDeciding to free Peru (what is now Peru and Bolivia) from what he considered to be an authoritarian project, De la Mar promoted an anti-Bolivarian campaign which gained popular support and led to insurrections, both in Peru and in Bolivia (Alto Per\u00fa), where the Colombian Army was expelled. Finally, he decided to confront Bolivar more directly by launching an attack. On June 3, 1828, de la Mar invaded the southern region of Gran Colombia; he occupied [[Loja Province|Loja]] and tried to capture [[Guayas Province|Guayas]], and intended to annex those territories to Peru.\n\nFurious upon hearing the news, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar resolved to declare war against Peru. Sucre was appointed Commander of the Colombian Army. In 1829, De la Mar and General [[Agustin Gamarra]] occupied Cuenca, but were defeated in what is known as the Battle of Portete de Tarqui (also known as the [[Battle of Tarqui]]) by Sucre on February 27, 1829. A coup supported by General Gamarra in the Peruvian Army against President De la Mar paved the way for a peace treaty. Subsequently, the ''Convenio de Gir\u00f3n'' between Peru and Gran Colombia recognizes as borders the \"same ones of the corresponding Viceroyalties before independence.\" On July 10, the ''Piura Armistice'' recognised the annexation of [[Guayaquil]] to Gran Colombia, and on September 22, the war between Peru and Gran Colombia formally ended.

The ''uti possidetis'' principle was ratified, allowing for small concessions with the end of coming up with a more natural and precise border so as to avoid further conflict. The parties agreed to form a binational commission to establish a permanent border. [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/exteriores/Libroweb/cap2.htm]\n\nThe Gran Colombia federation dissolved during 1830 because of political struggles between regions which strengthened after Bolivar's resignation. Ecuador was born as a country on May 13, 1830 and began its separate existence with the adoption of a Constitution on September 23, 1830. According to this constitution, the [[Republic of Ecuador]] was composed of the provinces of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] and [[Quito]]. These provinces later divided into the many provinces that exist today in Ecuador.\n\n===Confusion about Gran Colombia===\nThe term Gran Colombia is used today to refer to the federation that was formed between the Republics of Ecuador, Colombia (with Panama) and Venezuela before 1830. However, ''Gran Colombia'' is an anachronistic term, as the country was simply referred to as ''Colombia'', which is clear, for example, by looking at original documentation of the many treaties signed between ''Colombia'' and Peru before 1830.\n\nIn Peru, the dissolution of Gran Colombia is seen as a country ceasing to exist, giving way to the formation of new nation states that had nothing to do with the original federation. The significant implication of this view is that the treaties Peru had signed with Gran Colombia were voided, as the country in question no longer existed, and was replaced with three new states, the [[Republic of New Granada]] (which subsequently changed its name to Republic of Colombia), the Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Ecuador.\n\nAn alternative view is that Ecuador and Venezuela separated from the Gran Colombia Federation (from Colombia in actuality) and inherited any treaties that Gran Colombia had signed with Peru as they applied to their corresponding territories. There are indications that Colombia itself maintained this position. On the surface, it seems far-fetched that the Republic of Colombia after 1830 is a different country from the Republic of Colombia before 1830, even though they shared a capital city, a subset of territory and much of their citizenry. Additionally, the argument that border treaties are voided when federations are dissolved does not appear to have substantial merit and is clearly conflict-prone.{{Original research inline|date=October 2007}}\n\n===The Piedemonte-Mosquera Protocol===\nEcuador and Colombia maintain that the Piedemonte-Mosquera Protocol was signed in [[Lima]] on August 11, 1830 by Peru and Gran Colombia as a result of the Battle of Portete de Tarqui. The protocol settled the eastern section of the disputed border from the Andes Mountains to Brazil by making the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]] and [[Amazon River]] the new border between the two republics. The protocol settled the western section of the border from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean by making the Macar\u00e1 river and the [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] river the new boundary. However, it left the status of a small area in the Andes Mountains named Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros in dispute. It was decided by Pedemonte and Mosquera that on a later date, either the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River would be chosen as the new boundary.\n\nEcuador has used this protocol as primary legal support of its core claims throughout the history of the conflict. Peru has disputed the credibility and the existence of the Piedemonte-Mosquera protocol on several points:\n\n* The original document has not been produced either by Colombia or Ecuador.\n* Piedemonte and Mosquera were believed to be at different locations on the day in question.\n* The protocol was never ratified by either country's congress.\n* Even if the protocol took place, Ecuador had separated from the Gran Colombia Federation a month before the signing of the protocol&nbsp;\u2013 August 11, 1830.\n* The copy produced by Colombia is not sufficient evidence for Peru.\n\nEven though it seems unlikely that Ecuador would have concocted a historical treaty of this nature, the fact that the existence of the original document cannot be demonstrated conclusively is significant.\n\nEcuador has managed to produce a copy made in 1870 that the Colombian embassy in Lima sent to [[Bogot\u00e1]]. The copy in question was obtained from someone's personal collection. However, it was not certified by Peru and remains disputed.\n\nThe Piedemonte-Mosquera protocol is mentioned in a Colombian document titled Legislative Act No. 3 published October 31, 1910.

The disputed territories (triangular in shape) at that time was disputed between Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and covered everything east of the Andes mountains and everything in between the Caquet\u00e1-Japur\u00e1 river and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n-Amazon river.\n\n* '''March 10, 1853: Creation of the Peruvian Government of Loreto'''\n:To justify its claims to the disputed amazonian territory Peru decides to create a separate amazonian political military government naming it the Government of Loreto, after Peru successfully takes over a small amazonian port called Nauta. The policy of the Loreto Government is to concentrate on exploring, taking over, and settling these vacant areas with Peruvian citizens before Ecuador and Colombia, thus having a good de facto position if the dispute goes to arbitration. Before 1890, the fluvial armada concentrated in taking over the small river ports along the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river like Nauta, Omaguas, Iquitos, Regis, Parinari, Antonio, Santander, Barrabca, Borja, Mazan, and Destacamento. Most of the exploration of the tributary rivers north of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river was conducted by a Peruvian military commander named Coronel Pedro Portillo in the early 20th century. The Peruvian fluvial armada at that time consisted of lightly armed rafts and boats with its main base in Iquitos, the capital of Loreto. In this way most of the northern tributary rivers which drained into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n&nbsp;\u2013 Amazon river and its adjacent disputed territories were occupied by Peruvians.\n\n==The Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u20131860==\n\n{{main|Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857\u20131860}}\n\nThis was an expensive war fought over disputed territory bordering the Amazon. On September 21, 1857 Ecuador decided to adjudicate to Britain territories in the ''Canelos'' region as payment for international debt it had incurred during the war of independence. Peru immediately protested the Ecuadorian action citing the ''uti possidetis juris'' principle by which the ''Canelos'' region would belong to Peru, based on the territorial concession of 1802 to the ''Viceroyalty of Peru''. Despite Peruvian complaints, Ecuador proceeded in its negotiations with the British. This led to an 1859 occupation and blockade of [[Guayaquil]] by President Castilla. (Ecuador at the time was undergoing a civil struggle.) On February 25, 1860, Peruvian minister Manuel Morales and his Ecuadorian counterpart, Nicol\u00e1s Estrada, signed the ''Treaty of Mapasingue'' in order to end the dispute. (Mapasingue is a location near Guayaquil where Peruvian troops had been stationed.) Ecuador voided the concession of territories claimed by Peru to the British, and Peru withdrew its forces. However, the territorial situation remained unclear and was left to be resolved at a later time.\n\n==1860\u20131941==\n\n* '''1864: Peruvian Navy establishes presence in Iquitos'''\n:Steamships of the Peruvian Navy arrived at Iquitos, first the ''Morona'' and ''Pastaza'' of 500 and 300 tons, and then two smaller steamboats of 50 tons, the ''Napo'' and the ''Putumayo''. Shortly afterwards a dockyard and a navy factory arrive from England and are installed, thus establishing the ''Factoria Naval de Iquitos''.\n\n* '''August 1, 1887: Espinoza-Bonifaz Convention'''\n:In the Espinoza-Bonifaz convention Ecuador and Peru submitted their dispute to arbitration by the King of Spain. Ecuador announced its withdrawal from the process months before a decision was issued, which was expected to be in 1910. Ecuador alleged that the King was not impartial because the officially undisclosed decision was not favorable. Additionally, there were popular protests in Ecuador against Peru. The King subsequently abstained from issuing a decision. Arbitration documents confirmed Peru's right to Maynas and other lands in dispute. [http://abyayala.nativeweb.org/ecuador/border/border1.html] Ecuador's position was that arbitration did not arrive at a satisfactory conclusion because even Peru's representative had expressed that the King did not have the capacity to consolidate peace, as both countries were parting from absolutely opposing principles.

This was in part accepted by Peru due to the recent Peru-Chile (1879\u20131883) war, which resulted in its defeat and loss of territory to Chile. The treaty signed by Pablo Herrera and Arturo Garc\u00eda gave, dominion and access to the Amazon river, the [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]] rivers, and control over parts of the provinces of [[Tumbes Province|Tumbes]] and [[Maynas Province, Peru|Maynas]], and the ''Canelos'' [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/exteriores/Libroweb/cap5.htm]. This treaty was quickly ratified by Ecuador's congress. Since the Peruvian Congress thought the treaty unfavourable, they ratified it in October 1891, provided they were allowed to introduce modifications, which reduced Ecuadorian sovereignty over the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n&nbsp;\u2013 Amazon rivers. Ecuador's congress subsequently disapproved the Herrera-Garc\u00eda treaty due to the modifications introduced by Peru. Ecuador also requested meetings to further discuss its validity thesis on the Guayaquil (Gual-Larrea) Treaty of 1829.

The first one is known as the ''Angostero Combat'' and the second one occurred at a location known as ''Torres Causana''. Less numerous but better equipped Peruvian forces were able to cause the retreat of Ecuadorian troops to locations around the [[Tena, Ecuador|Tena]] and [[Archidona]] rivers.

With this treaty Ecuador relinquishes its ancient Spanish colonial rights to present-day Brazilian territory that exactly covers an area between the Caqueta and Amazon rivers.\n* '''July 15, 1916: Mu\u00f1oz-Suarez Treaty between Colombia and Ecuador'''\n:This treaty put an end to a long border dispute, that arose after Ecuador's separation from the Gran Colombia on May 13, 1830. Under the terms of the treaty, the new boundary was a somewhat straight imaginary line that started in the Pacific Ocean and ended in the Amazon River. In the Andes region the boundary followed the present borders between Ecuador and Colombia. Then starting around 75\u00b0W Longitude the border followed a somewhat straight line midway between the Putumayo and Napo rivers until it reaches the Ampiyacu River, which was picked as a natural border in jungle region between Ecuador and Colombia. The border then followed the Ambiyacu River and ended when it reached 72\u00b0W Longitude on the Amazon River. With this treaty Ecuador gave up a portion of its ancient colonial claims to a territory that reached north to the Caqueta River and east to the Brazilian border.\n* '''June 21, 1924: Ponce-Castro Oyangurin Protocol'''\n:This is a protocol signed between Ecuador and Peru, wherein both parties agreed to send their representatives to Washington so that they could try to resolve their border disputes in an amicable manner through a direct negotiation compromise method followed by a partial arbitration by the President of the United States. The meetings commenced September 30, 1935, and lasted two years. From the start the President of the United States was asked not to interfere with the direct negotiations by the Peruvian delegation, since his duty would be to arbitrate a final solution based on these direct negotiations if said negotiations failed. During that time period neither party seemed to agree on defining the boundaries of the disputed area to arbitrate by the President of the United States. In essence, Ecuador considered all of Tumbez, Ja\u00e9n, and Maynas to be Ecuadorian because of its numerous de jure colonial titles, but was willing to divide them up through a compromise negotiation method for the sake of peace. In contrast, Peru considered Tumbez, Ja\u00e9n, and Maynas to be all Peruvian because of their de facto occupation and the real cedula of 1802 title, and showed up in Washington to only negotiate what the borders of these provinces were in relation to Ecuador. Because of the failure to agree on what lands were disputed, the conference in Washington was doomed to failure. Finally, on February 6, 1937 Ecuador proposed a transactional line similar to the Herrera-Garcia Treaty for arbitration and asked for complete arbitration by the President of the United States if this is rejected. Peru promptly rejected this the next day and later the Peruvian Delegation passed a note to the Ecuadorian Delegation, which informed them that they had just received instructions from their government in Peru to abandon the negotiations. Because of this the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was not able to put a final solution to the border dispute through a peaceful arbitration.\n* '''July 6, 1936: Ulloa-Viteri Accord'''\n:This agreement established a [[status quo]] border line based on the effective possession of territory that each country had in the Amazon region at the time. This border was very similar to that established by the Rio de Janeiro Protocol 5 years later. To Ecuador, the status quo line simply demonstrated how much territory Peru had taken from Ecuador in the preceding century. Ecuador never considered this agreement a final treaty of borders, and continued its aspirations which were based on Gual-Larrea and Pedemonte-Mosquera.\n\n==The Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War==\n{{main|Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War}}\n\nIn 1941, the two countries went to war. As with all other such incidents, there are conflicting accounts to this day as to which side fired the first shot. Peru's version of events (notably well documented in Peruvian sources [http://www.alasdegloria.com/Sec5p1.htm][http://www.geocities.com/peruvictorsofcenepa/fap-1941.html]{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}) is that Ecuador had been making incursions into its territory since 1937 and occupied several border locations by 1940.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the President of Peru, [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]], ordered the formation of the ''North Grouping'', a military unit in charge of the ''Northern Operational Theater'', on January 11, 1941, consisting of two light divisions with three battalions each, plus four other independent battalions and three artillery batteries (one with six 105&nbsp;mm guns) (''Delgado'').\n\nIn front of these forces, the Ecuadorian Border Security command had under its orders two Army battalions, the \"Montecristi\" and the \"Cayambe\", each one consisting of around 250 troops, armed with [[Karabiner 98k|7.92&nbsp;mm Mauser]] rifles and a couple of [[ZB vz. 26|Czech 7,92&nbsp;mm ZB-26]] light machine-guns, plus two [[Vickers-Maxim]] machine-guns. There was also a \"C\u00f3rdova\" battalion, made up of around 100 troops, and a so-called \"Mariscal Sucre\" artillery battery, with 71 troops and no artillery pieces. In fact, the only artillery in the whole province of El Oro consisted of six [[Cannone da 65/17 modello 13|Italian 65&nbsp;mm]] mountain guns, sold to Ecuador as leftovers from the Great War, and almost without shells. These guns were never put into action. (''Rodr\u00edguez, 1943'').\n\nAs for anti-aircraft defenses, the Ecuadorians had only a pair of [[Breda Model 35|20&nbsp;mm Breda]] guns deployed on Puerto Bolivar, which was the only port of entry for supplies, reinforcements, and weapons to arrive to the province, by sea, from the port-city of Guayaquil. The Ecuadorian Army of 1941 had not a single warplane. (''Rodr\u00edguez, 1943'').\n\nIt is claimed that on Saturday, July 5, 1941 the [[Huaquillas]] unit of the Ecuadorian army invaded Peruvian territory, an action which originated a combat that extended across the entire [[Zarumilla]] front, up to a region known as ''Quebrada Seca''.\n\nEcuador's version of events is that Peru's invasion was an unprovoked act of aggression carried out with the explicit purpose of forcing Ecuador to sign an unfavorable treaty that would impose the status quo border line.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 by Ecuador's Foreign Ministry indicated that Peruvian forces had been seen advancing north towards the border; all of the Peruvian troops stationed in [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]] had left [[Zarumilla]] and those in [[Piura]] and other nearby sites were in turn advancing towards [[Zarumilla]].\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the actions of the Ecuadorian army were limited to repelling the invasion which was occurring across much of the border. [http://www.alasdegloria.com/elcomercio/elc4.htm] As support for its arguments Ecuador has repeatedly cited the obvious difference in military might between the two countries, and the lack of preparedness of its forces. It has been speculated that Peru prepared to carry out an all-out invasion and could have been simply waiting for the slightest provocation.\n\nEcuador has also cited Peru's history of conflict with its other neighbors as evidence of its belligerence. It has been pointed out, however, that these circumstances did not preclude Ecuador from attempting to lay claim to territories it still considered its own. Also, during the [[War of the Pacific]], Ecuador military occupied a portion of the disputed territories.\n\nThe much larger and better equipped Peruvian force of 13,000 men quickly overwhelmed the 1,800 Ecuadorian troops guarding the province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]]. The Peruvian army had at its disposal a battalion of armor made up of [[Panzer 38(t)|Czech tanks LTP]], with artillery and air support. (Beginning with the second third of the 20th century, Peru allegedly has one of the strongest military forces in South America, even as recently as 2005 ranked second after Brazil and stronger than Argentina [https://web.archive.org/web/20050725012911/http://americas.irc-online.org/am/165]).\n\nThe Ecuadorian president, [[Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo]], kept Ecuador's best forces in [[Quito]], for fear of his political opponents (Arroyo would later resign on May 31, 1944 after much unrest in the country). Peru carried out the first use of [[paratroops]] in combat in the [[Western Hemisphere]], dropping three paratroopers over the port-city of Puerto Bol\u00edvar (''Delgado''), one of them having been rescued by Ecuadorian fishermen when he landed on the waters of the Jambel\u00ed channel.\n\nThis attempt was largely successful in allowing a relatively easy takeover of El Oro towns, devoid by then of any Ecuadorian military presence after the short-lived ceasefire of July 26, brokered by the mediator countries (USA, Brazil and Argentina). After the ceasefire, most of the Ecuadorian troops, by now exhausted and without ammunition, left the field of battle and made their way out of El Oro, towards the city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]].\n\nThus, when Peru reopened the advance on July 29, which began with simultaneous bombings on the Ecuadorian towns of Machala, Puerto Bol\u00edvar, Pasaje, Santa Rosa, and Arenillas, plus a mission to the city of Guayaquil to drop leaflets, the Peruvian forces easily occupied the deserted towns of the province. A new ceasefire having been decreed to enter in effect on July 31 at 18h00 forced the Peruvian command to step up its efforts to occupy Machala and Puerto Bol\u00edvar, which they did with troops disembarked directly on Puerto Bol\u00edvar from the sea in the afternoon of July 31. (''Delgado'')\n\nEven then, hostilities didn't cease, as Peruvian forces began operations against the Ecuadorian posts on the Amazonian jungle, most of which were easily overrun.\n\nWith Peru occupying [[El Oro Province|El Oro]] and menacing [[Guayaquil]], plus pressure from the United States and Latin America to stop the hostilities as a sign of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis powers]] (in World War II), Peru and Ecuador signed the [[Rio de Janeiro]] Protocol.\n\n==Rio de Janeiro Protocol==\n[[Image:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the dispute {{in lang|es}}]]\n{{details|Rio Protocol}}\n\nIn May 1941, as tensions at the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border mounted and war was imminent, the governments of the United States of America, Brazil, and [[Argentina]] offered their services in aiding in the mediation of the dispute. Their efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities on July 23, 1941, but the diplomatic intervention led to a definitive cease-fire being put into place on July 31. Despite this, limited [[skirmish]]es continued to occur through the months of August and September in the Ecuadorian provinces of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]] and [[Loja Province|Loja]], as well as in the Amazonian lands. Ecuador accused Peru of continuing its advances into the highland province of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]].\n\nOn October 2, with military observers from the three mediating countries serving as witnesses, Ecuador and Peru signed the '''Talara Accord''', which created a demilitarized zone inside the provinces of El Oro and Loja, pending the signing of a definitive peace treaty. Diplomatic efforts continued, with the mediating countries being joined by [[Chile]].\n\nOn January 29, 1942, on the final day of the third Pan-American Summit, held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru, [[Julio Tobar Donoso]] and [[Alfredo Solf y Muro]], signed a \"Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries\", known as the '''Rio de Janeiro Protocol'''. The observers from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile co-signed the document, becoming \"Guarantors of the Protocol\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122235546/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |archivedate=2005-11-22 }}</ref> The Rio Protocol was subsequently ratified by each country's congress on February 26, 1942.\n\nBy the terms of the Protocol, Ecuador agreed to withdraw its long-standing claim for rights to direct land access to the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] rivers; Peru agreed to withdraw Peruvian military forces from Ecuadorian territory. An area of {{convert|200,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of hitherto disputed territory in the Maynas region of the Amazonian basin was awarded to Peru, which had been established to be the [[de facto]] possessor of the land since the end of the 19th century. The \"status quo\" line defined in the 1936 Lima Accord was used as the basis for the definitive border line; the previous border recognized current possessions, but not [[sovereignty]]. Relative to the 1936 line, Ecuador ceded 18,552&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of previously possessed territory to Peru, while Peru ceded 5,072&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of previously possessed territory to Ecuador.<ref>Julio Tobar Donoso, ''La Invasi\u00f3n Peruana y el Protocolo de Rio.

P. 462.</ref>\n\n===Ecuador's objections to the Protocol and thesis of Nullity===\n\nSix times during the demarcation technical problems were found and referred to the Guarantors, with Brazil acting as lead. One of them, which involved the then contested ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'', was submitted to arbitration by Captain Braz Dias de Aguiar. Both countries initially accepted the arbiter's award, issued July 1945, and demarcation began in the area according to that ruling.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1946 the [[United States Air Force]] performed several aerial reconnaissance missions over the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region (losing 2 aircraft and 14 men in accidents.) to help in the demarcation efforts. They found that the ''Cenepa river'' was much longer than previously thought and that it runs between the [[Zamora River|Zamora]] and the [[Santiago River (Ecuador)|Santiago]]. This finding conflicted with article VIII, point B-1 of the Rio Protocol, which laid out delineation of the border for that area as follows:\n\n:''From the Quebrada de San Francisco, the watershed between the Zamora and Santiago Rivers, to the confluence of the Santiago River with the Yaupi;''\n\nThe difficulty was that there is not one watershed between the Zamora and the Santiago, but two, as interpreted by Ecuador. This resulted in Ecuadorian president [[Galo Plaza]] halting demarcation in 1949. About 78 kilometers of border were left unmarked. In 1953 Ecuador withdrew from the Demarcation Commissions, claiming the Protocol \"impossible to implement\" in that area.\n\nOn September 29, 1960 Ecuadorian president [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] declared the Rio Protocol null and void. (Peruvian analysts have speculated that this was a politically motivated move by Velasco Ibarra, who was considered a populist, but evidence to support this assertion is totally circumstantial).\n\nWith the sole exception of [[Cuba]], the American community did not approve of Ecuador's diplomatic move, with the United States sending a letter of protest to Ecuador.\n\nThe arguments for what is called Ecuador's ''thesis of nullity'' varied, but they were generally the following:\n\n* It was imposed by military force.\n* It was signed while Ecuadorian towns were under occupation; invasion and occupation of nation states are prohibited by international law.\n* International law does not accept the conquest of territory by force or violence. Even considering de facto possession (1936 status quo border line) Peru took about 14,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory.\n* There was lack of compliance by Peru in denying Ecuador free navigation in Amazonian rivers as stipulated.\n* It was a blow to the economic development of a South American country, which is contrary to existing pacts of cooperation.\n\nPeru's counter-arguments included the following:\n\n* Ecuador cannot unilaterally invalidate a protocol\n* The core argument on implementability is a demarcation issue, not a justification to invalidate the entire protocol\n* Peru disputes the notion that the protocol was imposed by ''premeditated'' military force\n* Even though the protocol was signed while Peruvian troops were still occupying El Oro for tactical reasons, the Ecuadorian congress ratified it long after Peruvian troops had left\n* Several Peruvian governments restricted the navigation clause in response to Ecuador's position on the treaty\n* On the issue of conquest of territory by force, Peru has pointed out that the disputed territories (Tumbes, Ja\u00e9n and Maynas) were not under ''de jure'' Ecuadorian administration, and that the province of El Oro was not annexed to Peru\n\nEcuador argued its thesis extensively for 30 years, but did not find support in the international community. Peru's position, on the other hand, was that a dispute did not exist at all after 1941, a position which lasted until 1995, when it was recognized as a problematic diplomatic issue.\n\nMaps published in Ecuador since the 1960s up to the end of the 20th century officially had to exclude the unmarked 78 kilometers of border, that is, the Rio Protocol line was drawn as unresolved, and to include what Ecuador considered as its own by right, according to the Pedemonte-Mosquera protocol (1830) line, which puts the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] ([[Amazon River|Amazon]]) river as the border between Peru and Ecuador.\n\nSuch controversial maps of Ecuador, known in Ecuador as \"Tufi\u00f1o's map\", were referred in Peru as ''\"mapa recortado del Peru\"'' (''cut-off map of Peru'').\n\n==The Paquisha Incident (1981)==\n{{Main|Paquisha Incident}}\nThe Paquisha War was a brief military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] over the control of three watchposts. While Peru felt that the matter had already been decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\n==The Cenepa War (1995)==\n{{Main|Cenepa War}}\nThe Cenepa War was a brief (January 26 \u2013 February 28, 1995) and localized military conflict between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], fought over control of a disputed area on the border between the two countries.  The two nations had signed a border treaty following the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]] of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1996 Ecuador declared the treaty null and void.\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the Cenepa War \u2014 both sides claimed victory \u2014 along with the mediation efforts of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and the [[United States]], paved the way for the opening of diplomatic negotiations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]) on 26 October 1998.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict, viwed on 2013-07-15, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas |date=2013-09-27 }}</ref> The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to the longest territorial dispute in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/>\n\n==1995\u20131998: Arbitration and final resolution==\n\nA cease fire was brokered by the four guarantor countries, and subsequently the ''[[Itamaraty]] Peace Declaration'' was signed on February 17, 1995. One of the declaration's clauses included the creation of the '''Military Observer Mission Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP)''' in order to verify ceasefire agreements, as well as observe and report infractions through diplomatic channels.\n\nThe MOMEP contingent was made up of observers, logistics, and aviation support from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile as part of ''Operation Safe Border''. The mission, unique in its scope, was fully funded by Peru and Ecuador. MOMEP was largely successful despite several tragic accidents due to land mines left in the area.\n\nAt a critical moment during late July and early August 1998 it appeared that Peruvian forces were preparing a preemptive assault on Ecuadorian forces (this is partially believed due to the Peruvian Air Force buying 19 Soviet-built [[MiG-29]] fighter planes and 18 [[Su-25]] attack aircraft from Belarus to counter the abysmal state the airforce was in at the beginning of the conflict, with 80% of the fleet grounded due to lack of spare parts), but the presence of the MOMEP contingent was instrumental in defusing the\nsituation.

Both countries agreed to a guarantor-sponsored technical commission composed of boundary experts in order to resolve the matter.\n\nBefore a critical meeting planned in Brazil for early 1997, both countries entered a period of unforeseen political events. In Peru, there was a hostage [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|crisis in its Japanese embassy]] involving guerrillas of the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]]. Ecuador was going through a period of political instability as\nPresident [[Abdala Bucaram]], a strong supporter of an agreement on the border issue, was removed by congress due to alleged mental incapacity. (President Bucaram, who is known for his unusual antics, had visited Peru and was seen on TV eating [[ceviche]] and wearing alpaca hoods\u2014a traditional indigenous outfit\u2014along with President [[Alberto Fujimori]].)\n\nThese delays nevertheless gave the guarantors more time to come up with a solution to the dispute. Eventually they concluded that a resolution would not be possible without granting something to each party.\n\nThe commission recognized Ecuador's position on one small already demarcated section of the border, and Peru's position on the larger issue of the single watershed between the Zamora and Santiago rivers. The latter was a blow to Ecuador's historic position, and left [[Tiwintza Canton|Tiwintza]] in Peruvian territory.\n\nThe solution that the commission reached was that an area of one square kilometer in the place of the fiercest struggle, Tiwinza, on the Peruvian side of the border, would be granted to Ecuador as a non-sovereign private property. The site could be used by Ecuador for commemorative and non-military events. Everyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian. Although none of the countries was completely satisfied with the solution, both accepted it, which was a significant diplomatic success.\n\nThe resolution also called for the creation of two national parks contiguous to one another (also referred to as a ''binational park'') in the ''Cordillera del Condor'' region.\n\nAmbassador Luigi Einaudi, the US guarantor representative, is credited with coming up with the idea of a private property concession in Tiwintza, working almost full-time on the problem, and coming up with ways to express issues in a manner not offensive to either party.

Formal demarcation of border regions started on May 13, 1999. The agreement was ratified without opposition by both nations' congress. U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] said: \"This signing marks the end of the last and longest running source of armed international conflict in the Western hemisphere\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/201442.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peru and Ecuador sign border treaty | date=October 27, 1998 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Political, social and economic impact==\nThis dispute is unique and significant in the study of causes and resolution of international conflict. Ecuador and Peru are populated by people who share a language, a culture, a religious preference, have basically the same social and ethnic diversity, and comparable economic difficulties. They are also both democracies (for the most part in modern times) which puts in doubt the common contention that [[Democratic peace theory|democracies never go to war with each other]].\n\n===Education and public perception===\n\nA 2000 study carried out as part of the educational ''ASA Program'' found teaching curriculum relating to the dispute to be extremely one-sided in both countries:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8ung.at/griesse/spanisch/themen/peru-ec/informe.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901055338/http://www.8ung.at/griesse/spanisch/themen/peru-ec/informe.pdf |archivedate=2005-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n* Notably, in Ecuador the dispute is a central issue in the study of Ecuador's borders. (Traditionally there has been a course named \"''History of Borders''.\")\n* In Peru, the educational system does not give as much importance to the dispute with Ecuador, and is part of the course ''\"Peruvian History\"''. In contrast, the only topic related to the territorial dispute that is normally taught is the '''Rio Protocol''', and its importance in the settlement of this dispute.\n\nMany examples of bias are cited, which can typically be characterized as removal of critical information about the other side's position. Emotional and nationalistic coloring of the material also appears to be routine. Although expected under the circumstances, this has likely fed the cycle of conflict in the past.\n\nCitizens of Ecuador and Peru feel both their countries have lost territory over time. The issue is one of overlapping maximalist territorial claims and aspirations.\n\nHigh Peruvian military spending is seen by Ecuador as evidence of belligerence and expansionism. Peru also considers Ecuador belligerent and expansionist.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century things appear to have improved considerably. The '''[[Cenepa War]]''' of 1995 allowed an honorable resolution of the conflict without a clear winner. To many Ecuadorians this was viewed as restoring the honor of the country, which was at least as important as their claims to the disputed territory. Unfortunately, not everyone is completely satisfied.\n\nToday, the entire Ecuadorian-Peruvian border is clearly delimited and demarcated, and the maps of both countries agree on the location of the common frontier. Bilateral work is being done by both countries Foreign Affairs officers to consolidate the economic and social integration. We can see part of this done by the Peruvian government with their Consulate in Machala, El Oro, where Minister [[Efrain Saavedra]] is the Consul General.\n\n===Economic impact===\nOne of the concerns both countries have had is the impact of the dispute on foreign investment. Thomas McLarty, US envoy at the resolution talks and former aid to President [[Bill Clinton]], has said peace is essential to South America's economic recovery. He added: \"You clearly cannot have long-term growth and prosperity involving foreign investment without stability\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/201442.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peru and Ecuador sign border treaty | date=October 27, 1998}}</ref> While there are still political instability issues in the region, resolution of the territorial conflict is helpful.\n\nTrade between both countries has benefited considerably. Before signing the peace treaty, annual trade between Peru and Ecuador was about 100 million dollars. But as early as 1998, it had increased 5-fold.<ref>http://www.fujimorialberto.com/index.php?selection=artAll&articleId=1038</ref>\n\nThere was also a broad agreement of integration between both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/Seminar-Lima/cabezas_lima_e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427063628/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/Seminar-Lima/cabezas_lima_e.htm |archivedate=2005-04-27 }}</ref><ref>http://planbinacional.rree.gob.pe/domino/nsf/planbinacional.nsf/0/B773348FF71A8F9C05256F5D007779A0?OpenDocument{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It included a binational fund for peace and development, national plans for productive, social and environmental development, and so on.\n\n===Political implications===\nAccording to Gabriel Marcella ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|US Department of National Security and Strategy]]), as a result of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute \"a number of emerging views about international affairs, U.S. foreign policy, and modern inter-American affairs were either shattered or seriously challenged\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/research_pubs/amazon.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219214209/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/research_pubs/amazon.pdf |archive-date=2006-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of the global and regional political implications of the dispute which have been noted are the following:\n\n* It was a blow to the idea that democracies do not go to war with one another. An armed conflict between these two nations has existed well before then, nevertheless, on and off with major confrontations occurring in 1941, 1981 and 1995. Ecuador and Peru have both been full-fledged democracies for the most part in modern times, although of course not perfect or politically stable.\n* It was a blow to the idea that Latin America is a model for peaceful international relations. It is a reminder that there are other territorial disputes and conflicting claims among other Latin American countries which could potentially threaten peace in the region.\n* Civil-military relations in both countries have been impacted and need to be reexamined. If in fact the conflict was allowed to escalate after accidental encounters between patrols, it has been suggested that the civilian authority should perhaps assume more solid leadership and control.\n* The principle that territorial treaties in Latin America are not the result of force or violence needs to be reexamined as a result.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dispute resolution]]\n* [[Territorial dispute]]\n* [[Paquisha Incident]]\n* General [[Richelieu Levoyer]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references group=\"Notes\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9YA-AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s\n|title=A study of the question of boundaries between the republics of Peru and Ecuador\n|last1=Santamar\u00eda de Paredes\n|first1=Vicente\n|last2=Weston Van Dyke\n|first2=Harry\n|publisher= Press of B.S.

Savory played for Ponsonby United from 1911 to 1914 and scored 16 tries and kicked 13 goals. For Auckland he played 4 times, scoring 3 tries and kicking 11 goals all in the 1914 season. He had made a quick impression after switching codes and was selected to play for the touring New Zealand side on their visit to Australia. He was then selected for the 1911\u201312 tour of the United Kingdom for the Australasian side. In 1912 he was sent off in a club match versus Newton which meant he was unable to tour with the New Zealand team to Australia. In 1913 he was accused of injuring a player from Manukau and was banned for life however on appeal the New Zealand Council refused to confirm the ban and ultimately sacked the entire Auckland Rugby League board and selected a new one.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football Incident\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=153\n| date = 28 June 1913\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130628.2.77\n| accessdate = 12 August 2019}}</ref> Savory was also an outstanding boxer and in 1914 he became the National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing champion.

The first representative match of the season was played on 28 August when [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] defeated Thames by 27 points to 16 at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] with over 4,000 in attendance.

Savory played for Ponsonby United from 1911 to 1914 and scored 16 tries and kicked 13 goals. For Auckland he played 4 times, scoring 3 tries and kicking 11 goals all in the 1914 season. He had made a quick impression after switching codes and was selected to play for the touring New Zealand side on their visit to Australia. He was then selected for the 1911\u201312 tour of the United Kingdom for the Australasian side. In 1912 he was sent off in a club match versus Newton which meant he was unable to tour with the New Zealand team to Australia. In 1913 he was accused of injuring a player from Manukau and was banned for life however on appeal the New Zealand Council refused to confirm the ban and ultimately sacked the entire Auckland Rugby League board and selected a new one.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football Incident\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=153\n| date = 28 June 1913\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130628.2.77\n| accessdate = 12 August 2019}}</ref> Savory was also an outstanding boxer and in 1914 he became the National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing champion.

The first representative match of the season was played on 28 August when [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] defeated Thames by 27 points to 16 at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] with over 4,000 in attendance.

The strongest tornado occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and causing eight deaths. With a total of 32 tornado-related fatalities, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak since [[tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014|April 27\u201330, 2014]].

It then moved northeast along the entire length of the Harbin Creek and strengthened as it moved directly into the rural community of [[Retreat, South Carolina|Retreat]]. Trees and homes in this area suffered EF0 to EF1 damage as the tornado crossed over [[South Carolina Highway 11|SC 11]] and [[South Carolina Highway 24|24]]. EF1 damage continued as the tornado approached the Coneross Creek. Damage rapidly became more severe and widespread as the tornado crossed the creek and moved into more populated areas in the southwestern part of [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]]. Reaching EF3 strength, the tornado first struck a [[BorgWarner]] plant at the end of Evalona Drive, inflicting major structural damage to the facility and scattering large amounts of debris throughout the area. A security guard on the property was killed when a concrete-block guard shack was completely destroyed. A block-foundation house in this area was swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and a vehicle parked at this residence was blown into the basement. The large tornado then crossed the Wells Highway and moved through residential areas of Seneca. Many homes in this area sustained EF2 to EF3 damage, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls collapsed. Detached garages were destroyed, a gas station awning was shredded, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the path. The tornado had grown to a half\u2013mile wide at this point, and less severe damage was inflicted to numerous other homes in Seneca. Damage severity began to lessen as the tornado passed north of [[Utica, South Carolina|Utica]] and directly through the [[Jordania, South Carolina|Jordania]] community. Mainly EF1 damage was noted as dozens of homes were damaged along this segment of the path, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. The tornado maintained EF1 strength as it as it crossed [[US 123]] and continued to the northeast, where EF1 damage was inflicted to numerous trees. The tornado than crossed [[Hartwell Lake]] northwest of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] and produced some EF0 tree damage before lifting due-west of [[Central, South Carolina|Central]].\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 14 minutes, traveled 16.66 miles, was 900 yards wide. Its final rating was high\u2013end EF3. There was one fatality, and numerous injuries ocurred.

It then moved northeast along the entire length of the Harbin Creek and strengthened as it moved directly into the rural community of [[Retreat, South Carolina|Retreat]]. Trees and homes in this area suffered EF0 to EF1 damage as the tornado crossed over [[South Carolina Highway 11|SC 11]] and [[South Carolina Highway 24|24]]. EF1 damage continued as the tornado approached the Coneross Creek. Damage rapidly became more severe and widespread as the tornado crossed the creek and moved into more populated areas in the southwestern part of [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]]. Reaching EF3 strength, the tornado first struck a [[BorgWarner]] plant at the end of Evalona Drive, inflicting major structural damage to the facility and scattering large amounts of debris throughout the area. A security guard on the property was killed when a concrete-block guard shack was completely destroyed. A block-foundation house in this area was swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and a vehicle parked at this residence was blown into the basement. The large tornado then crossed the Wells Highway and moved through residential areas of Seneca. Many homes in this area sustained EF2 to EF3 damage, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls collapsed. Detached garages were destroyed, a gas station awning was shredded, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the path. The tornado had grown to a half\u2013mile wide at this point, and less severe damage was inflicted to numerous other homes in Seneca. Damage severity began to lessen as the tornado passed north of [[Utica, South Carolina|Utica]] and directly through the [[Jordania, South Carolina|Jordania]] community. Mainly EF1 damage was noted as dozens of homes were damaged along this segment of the path, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. The tornado maintained EF1 strength as it as it crossed [[US 123]] and continued to the northeast, where EF1 damage was inflicted to numerous trees. The tornado than crossed [[Hartwell Lake]] northwest of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] and produced some EF0 tree damage before lifting due-west of [[Central, South Carolina|Central]].\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 14 minutes, traveled 16.66 miles, was 900 yards wide. Its final rating was high\u2013end EF3. There was one fatality, and numerous injuries ocurred.
