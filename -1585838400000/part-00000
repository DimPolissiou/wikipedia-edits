Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths.

Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths.

The committee's objective is to prepare the public health system to deal with possible cases in Brazil. So far, there is no detection of any suspected cases in the country. The portfolio has been carrying out daily monitoring of the situation with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which has been monitoring the issue since the first reports of cases in [[Wuhan]], [[China]], on December 31, 2019. The [[Ministry of Health]] conducted this Thursday (23), in [[Bras\u00edlia]], a technical press conference to clarify doubts about the virus and inform the actions that the portfolio has taken, with the state and municipal health departments, in addition to other bodies, for a possible treatment of a suspected case in the country. During the press conference, the acting Health Minister, [[Jo\u00e3o Gabbardo]], highlighted that the portfolio will continue to inform Brazilian society as the situation updates by the WHO. \u201cThe Ministry of Health has an obligation to clarify and not generate unnecessary panic in the population and we are working together with the state departments for this purpose. Our laboratory network is prepared to carry out the tests and make the diagnostics \", highlighted Jo\u00e3o Gabbardo.\n\nThe COE is composed of technicians specialized in responding to public health emergencies. In addition to the [[Ministry of Health]], the group includes the Pan American Health Organization ([[PAHO]] / [[WHO]]), the National Health Surveillance Agency ([[Anvisa]]), the Evandro Chagas Institute ([[IEC]]), and other bodies. In this way, the country will be able to respond in a unified and immediate way to the entry of the virus in [[Brazilian]] territory. The [[Ministry of Health]] provides basic care to reduce the overall risk of acute [[respiratory]] [[infections]]. Among the guidelines are: avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; perform frequent hand washing, especially after direct contact with sick people or the environment; avoid close contact with wild [[animals]] and [[sick]] animals on [[farms]] or farms.\n\nSince learning about the cases of severe [[pneumonia]] in [[China]], the [[Brazilian Federal Government]] has adopted several actions to monitor and improve the country's capacity to act.

A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and [[English overseas possessions|Kingdom of Britain]] . France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The north american holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394&nbsp;km\u00b2 (46,098 sq. miles),  with 2.7 million people in 2013.

A few years later, in 1608, [[Samuel De Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]], which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of [[New France]] (also called Canada).<ref>Marcel Trudel, ''The Beginnings of New France, 1524\u20131663'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1973).</ref>\n\nNew France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]].

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

These were restored at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France's repurchase of Louisiana in 1800 came to nothing, as the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]] convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to [[Louisiana Purchase|its sale]] to the United States in 1803. The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798\u20131801 was not successful.

The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen P\u014dmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]] or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen P\u014dmare's allies in Leeward Islands.

He joined Britain in sending an army to China during [[Second Opium War]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1860), but French ventures to establish influence in [[Japan]] (1867) and [[Korea]] (1866) were less successful. His attempt to impose a European monarch, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure in 1867. To restore the Mexican Republic, 31,962 Mexicans died violently, including over 11,000 executed by firing squads, 8,304 were seriously wounded and 33,281 endured captivity in prisoner of war camps. Those Mexicans who fought for the monarchy sacrificed 5,671 of their number killed in combat, 2,159 badly wounded, and 4,379 taken prisoner.

A key part of the enterprise was the modernization of the French Navy; he began the construction of fifteen powerful new battle cruisers powered by steam and driven by propellers; and a fleet of steam powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain's. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, [[Zouaves]], the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.<ref>G.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered. There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M. Abun-Nasr|title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=264|isbn=9780521337670}}</ref>\n\nHis attempted reforms were interrupted in 1864 by an Arab insurrection, which required more than a year and an army of 85,000 soldiers to suppress. Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population.

A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and later [[English overseas possessions|Kingdom of Britain]] . France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The north american holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394&nbsp;km\u00b2 (46,098 sq. miles),  with 2.7 million people in 2013.

A few years later, in 1608, [[Samuel De Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]], which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of [[New France]] (also called Canada).<ref>Marcel Trudel, ''The Beginnings of New France, 1524\u20131663'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1973).</ref>\n\nNew France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]]. The extensive trading network throughout the region connected to Canada through the [[Great Lakes]], was maintained through a vast system of fortifications, many of them centred in the [[Illinois Country]] and in present-day Arkansas.<ref>Carl J.

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

These were restored at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France's repurchase of Louisiana in 1800 came to nothing, as the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]] convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to [[Louisiana Purchase|its sale]] to the United States in 1803. The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798\u20131801 was not successful.

The [[Franco-Tahitian War]] broke out between the [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] people and the French from 1844 to 1847 as France attempted to consolidate their rule and extend their rule into the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]] where Queen P\u014dmare sought refuge with her relatives. The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen P\u014dmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]] or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen P\u014dmare's allies in Leeward Islands. The French continued the guise of protection until the 1880s when they formally annexed Tahiti with the abdication of King [[P\u014dmare V]] on 29 June 1880.

He joined Britain in sending an army to China during [[Second Opium War]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1860), but French ventures to establish influence in [[Japan]] (1867) and [[Korea]] (1866) were less successful. His attempt to impose a European monarch, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure in 1867. To restore the Mexican Republic, 31,962 Mexicans died violently, including over 11,000 executed by firing squads, 8,304 were seriously wounded and 33,281 endured captivity in prisoner of war camps. Those Mexicans who fought for the monarchy sacrificed 5,671 of their number killed in combat, 2,159 badly wounded, and 4,379 taken prisoner.

A key part of the enterprise was the modernization of the French Navy; he began the construction of fifteen powerful new battle cruisers powered by steam and driven by propellers; and a fleet of steam powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain's. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, [[Zouaves]], the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico. By the end of Napoleon III's reign the French overseas territories had tripled in area; in 1870 they covered a million square kilometers, with more than five million inhabitants.<ref>Pierre Milza, ''Napol\u00e9on III'' (in French, Paris:  2006), pp. 626\u2013636</ref>\n\n===New Caledonia becomes a French possession (1853\u201354)===\nOn 24 September 1853, Admiral [[Auguste Febvrier Despointes|Febvrier Despointes]] took formal possession of [[New Caledonia]] and [[Port-de-France]] (Noum\u00e9a) was founded 25 June 1854.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.<ref>G.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M.

Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population.

The museum is located on a {{convert|100|acre|hectare|order=flip}} property in [[Kleinburg]], an unincorporated village in Vaughan. The property includes the museum's {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} main building, a sculpture garden, walking trails, and the cemetery for six members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]].\n\nThe collection dates back to 1955, when Robert and Signe McMichael began to collect works from artists associated to the Group of Seven, exhibiting their works at their home in Kleinburg. In 1965, the McMichaels formally reached an agreement to donate their collection collection and their Kleinburg property to the [[Government of Ontario]] in order to establish an art museum. The institution was opened to the public as the '''McMichael Conservation Collection of Art''' in 1966. The museum was formally incorporated into the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in 1972. Although the museum was originally established with an institutional focus on the Group of Seven, the museum's mandate was later expanded to include contemporary Canadian art,  and art from [[indigenous Canadians]].\n\nThe museum's permanent collection includes over 6,500 works from Canadian artists. In addition to its permanent collections, the institution also serves as the custodians for the archives of works on paper by [[Inuit]] artists based in [[[[Kinngait]]]]. The museum organizes and hosts a number of [[travelling exhibition|travelling art exhibitions]], typically focused on [[Canadian art]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1951 Robert and Signe McMichael purchased a {{convert|10|acre|hectare}} plot of land in [[Kleinburg]], [[Ontario]].{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=183}} A home was subsequently built in 1954, with the McMichaels moving into the property.<ref name=canen>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mcmichael-canadian-art-collection|title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|date=4 March 2015|accessdate=29 November 2019|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada}}</ref> The McMichaels began acquiring works by artists of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] for their personal collection, with the first being a painting by [[Tom Thomson]], acquired for [[Canadian dollar|C$]]250 in 1955.<ref name=g&m3>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/the-fraught-and-fierce-legacy-of-the-mcmichaels-cultural-vision/article27398658/|title=The fraught and fierce legacy of the McMichaels' cultural vision|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=7 December 2019|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Woodbridge Company|last=Adams|first=James}}</ref> In 1962, the McMichaels acquired Tom Thomson's studio situated outside the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in [[Toronto]], and relocated it to their property to begin restorations on it.{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=183}} By 1965, the McMichaels' personal collection contained 194 paintings either purchased or donated to them.<ref name=histoff>{{cite web|url=http://mcmichael.com/about/history/|title=Our History|publisher=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|year=2018|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Tom Thomson's studio at the McMichael Art Gallery (7376231718).jpg|thumb|The [[Tom Thomson]] Studio was relocated onto the property in 1962]]\nThe McMichaels began exhibiting their works on their Kleinburg property during the weekends, although growing number of visitors led the McMichaels to consider establishing a public a \"shrine\" dedicated to the Group of Seven.<ref name=canen/>{{sfn|Larsen|2009|p=210}} On 18 November 1965, the McMichaels and the [[Government of Ontario]] reached an agreement, where the McMichaels would donate the collection, and the property to the government, who would maintain the grounds, and maintain the \"spirit of the collection\".<ref name=canen/>{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=186}} As a part of the agreement, the McMichaels would maintain a degree of curatorial control, occupy two of the five seats in the museum's Board of Trustees, and permission to continue inhabiting the property, and be buried there.<ref name=g&m3/> The McMichaels continued to reside on the property until museum operations made it no longer possible; with the Government of Ontario providing them a home in [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]].<ref name=g&m3/>\n\nIn the months after the agreement was made, work was undertaken to re-purpose the property into an art museum, and prepare the exhibits for its collection.<ref name=g&m>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/mcmichael-canadian-art-collection-bets-big-on-past-for-50th-anniversary/article31387515/|title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection bets big on past for 50th anniversary|last=Adams|first=James|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Woodbridge Company|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> The property was formally opened to the public on 8 July 1966 as the McMichael Conservation Collection of Art.<ref name=histoff/> Robert McMichael served as the museum's first director, holding the position until resigning in 1981.{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=159}}\n\nIn 1968, Group of Seven member [[A.

The museum is located on a {{convert|100|acre|hectare|order=flip}} property in [[Kleinburg]], an unincorporated village in Vaughan. The property includes the museum's {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} main building, a sculpture garden, walking trails, and the cemetery for six members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]].\n\nThe collection dates back to 1955, when Robert and Signe McMichael began to collect works from artists associated to the Group of Seven, exhibiting their works at their home in Kleinburg. In 1965, the McMichaels formally reached an agreement to donate their collection collection and their Kleinburg property to the [[Government of Ontario]] in order to establish an art museum. The institution was opened to the public as the '''McMichael Conservation Collection of Art''' in 1966. The museum was formally incorporated into the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in 1972. Although the museum was originally established with an institutional focus on the Group of Seven, the museum's mandate was later expanded to include contemporary Canadian art,  and art from [[indigenous Canadians]].\n\nThe museum's permanent collection includes over 6,500 works from Canadian artists. In addition to its permanent collections, the institution also serves as the custodians for the archives of works on paper by [[Inuit]] artists based in [[[[Kinngait]]]]. The museum organizes and hosts a number of [[travelling exhibition|travelling art exhibitions]], typically focused on [[Canadian art]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1951 Robert and Signe McMichael purchased a {{convert|10|acre|hectare}} plot of land in [[Kleinburg]], [[Ontario]].{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=183}} A home was subsequently built in 1954, with the McMichaels moving into the property.<ref name=canen>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mcmichael-canadian-art-collection|title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|date=4 March 2015|accessdate=29 November 2019|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada}}</ref> The McMichaels began acquiring works by artists of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] for their personal collection, with the first being a painting by [[Tom Thomson]], acquired for [[Canadian dollar|C$]]250 in 1955.<ref name=g&m3>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/the-fraught-and-fierce-legacy-of-the-mcmichaels-cultural-vision/article27398658/|title=The fraught and fierce legacy of the McMichaels' cultural vision|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=7 December 2019|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Woodbridge Company|last=Adams|first=James}}</ref> In 1962, the McMichaels acquired Tom Thomson's studio situated outside the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in [[Toronto]], and relocated it to their property to begin restorations on it.{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=183}} By 1965, the McMichaels' personal collection contained 194 paintings either purchased or donated to them.<ref name=histoff>{{cite web|url=http://mcmichael.com/about/history/|title=Our History|publisher=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|year=2018|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Tom Thomson's studio at the McMichael Art Gallery (7376231718).jpg|thumb|The [[Tom Thomson]] Studio was relocated onto the property in 1962]]\nThe McMichaels began exhibiting their works on their Kleinburg property during the weekends, although growing number of visitors led the McMichaels to consider establishing a public a \"shrine\" dedicated to the Group of Seven.<ref name=canen/>{{sfn|Larsen|2009|p=210}} On 18 November 1965, the McMichaels and the [[Government of Ontario]] reached an agreement, where the McMichaels would donate the collection, and the property to the government, who would maintain the grounds, and maintain the \"spirit of the collection\".<ref name=canen/>{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=186}} As a part of the agreement, the McMichaels would maintain a degree of curatorial control, occupy two of the five seats in the museum's Board of Trustees, and permission to continue inhabiting the property, and be buried there.<ref name=g&m3/> The McMichaels continued to reside on the property until museum operations made it no longer possible; with the Government of Ontario providing them a home [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]].<ref name=g&m3/>\n\nIn the months after the agreement was made, work was undertaken to re-purpose the property into an art museum, and prepare the exhibits for its collection.<ref name=g&m>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/mcmichael-canadian-art-collection-bets-big-on-past-for-50th-anniversary/article31387515/|title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection bets big on past for 50th anniversary|last=Adams|first=James|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Woodbridge Company|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> The property was formally opened to the public on 8 July 1966 as the McMichael Conservation Collection of Art.<ref name=histoff/> Robert McMichael served as the museum's first director, holding the position until resigning in 1981.{{sfn|Knopf|2008|p=159}}\n\nIn 1968, Group of Seven member [[A.

It was released on November 12, 1996, by [[Death Row Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. After the success of his debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993), Snoop was charged with murder and in 1995, spent time preparing for the case that went to trial. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album without [[Dr. Dre]] providing work as a [[record producer]]. This was Snoop's final album on Death Row Records under his name of ''Snoop Doggy Dogg''. Recording sessions took place from February 1996 to October 1996, with [[Suge Knight]] filling in as the [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] on the album, alongside the additional production from several [[record producer]]s such as [[DJ Pooh]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Soopafly]] and [[L.T. Hutton]]; as well as [[guest appearance]]s from [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]], [[Tray Dee]] and [[Warren G]], among others.\n\nThe album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996, selling over 420,000 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of ''Doggystyle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&dq=snoop+dogg+bubbling+under&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilscbQ97XNAhXFh5AKHQIPAaIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20bubbling%20under&f=false |title=Billboard magazine - August 22, 1998 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> [[Dr. Dre]] had left Death Row to his partner [[Suge Knight]], who was indicted for racketeering by the end of 1996. ''Tha Doggfather'' was also released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', which debuted at number one. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, Snoop Dogg featured on the album ''[[The Chronic]]'' by close friend Dr. Dre, which was a great success.\n\nIn 1993, Snoop and Dr. Dre began work on ''Doggystyle'' which was also very popular and acclaimed. During the recording of ''Doggystyle'' Snoop became a defendant in a murder case which saw his acquittal shortly before this album was released, which led him to no longer live the \"gangsta\" lifestyle he portrayed in his records.\n\nDr. Dre, who was Death Row Records' in-house producer, had left earlier in 1996 to start [[Aftermath Entertainment|his own label]], which led Snoop's first cousin Daz Dillinger to become Death Row's head producer; he worked on this record. The [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murder of Snoop's close friend and fellow rapper, label-mate Tupac Shakur]] in September 1996 also weighed on him heavily; Shakur appears on the closing track \"Outro\", under the name \"Makaveli\", which he began using a short while before his death. \n\n==Release==\n''Tha Doggfather'' charted at number one on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. To date, the album sold two million copies in the United States and sold better internationally than its predecessor, \"Doggystyle\" (1993).\n\n==Music==\n\n===Production===\nDuring the departure of Dr. Dre from Death Row Records, the majority of this album was produced and mixed by [[DJ Pooh]]. In addition to DJ Pooh, Daz Dillinger and several other producers contributed to this album. In 1996, in an interview with [[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]], Snoop Dogg revealed that he had been working with Dr. Dre for this album; however, he had been prevented from doing so by Suge Knight. The album samples songs such as \"It's Like That\" performed by [[Run-D.M.C.]], \"[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]\" performed by [[Biz Markie]], \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" performed by [[Zapp & Roger]], and \"[[Oops Upside Your Head]]\" performed by [[The Gap Band]]. The Doggfather also marked the debut of Snoop Dogg as a [[record producer]] on the track \"(O.J.) Wake Up\". Snoop Dogg also was beginning to be acknowledged on how to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] by a high-profile producer named [[L.T. Hutton]], who led a hand providing some production on that track as well.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSDVUq8HaY |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 2) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe illustration on the back cover of the CD was done by Joe Cool, the same artist who did the front cover of Snoop's previous album ''Doggystyle''.\n\n===Lyrics===\nCompared to Doggystyle, the lyrics are much less violent and controversial. On ''Tha Doggfather'', Snoop Dogg wanted to present a more positive image in his lyrics, a reflection of his maturation as an artist and as a new father.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-CVjntHlA |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 1) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> On December 3, 2006, in an interview with [[Vh1]], Snoop Dogg revealed the differences between ''Doggystyle'' and ''Tha Doggfather'', stating, \"I think ''Tha Doggfather'' was a rebirth of me, as far as me being more positive on what I was tryin' to say and, you know, tryin' to live the life through my music, instead of me just livin' my life, tryin' to show people that my life... wasn't like my music...I'm not gonna glorify none of this negativity that Death Row wanted me to do. I'm gonna bring a positive side of music.\" Although his new lyrical direction was met with mixed feelings from fans and critics alike, Snoop Dogg still thinks of the album as a success: \"I enjoyed it and everywhere I go around the world people, you know, I sign more Doggfather records than any other record I put out. That's the one I sign the most and I'm proud at the thang I did and the thang is... sometimes you can outgrow your fans\".<ref>{{cite video |url=http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/122939/on-the-doggfather.jhtml#artist=1133 |title=On \"Tha Doggfather\" by Snoop Dogg |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]] \n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r244077|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''Tha Doggfather'' |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev2Score = B+<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295271,00.html |title=Music Review: 'Tha Doggfather' (1996) |first=J.D. |last=Considine |authorlink=J.D.

In a February issue of [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine, Dr. Dre stated his feelings on the album and said \"But to be perfectly honest, I don't like Snoop's new album. And it has nothing to do with me not working him, because I'm just like everybody else: I like it, or I don't. The first time I heard the single, I was grooving to it, but then I really started to get into the production and how it was sounding, you know?

[[Melody Maker]] ranked it #49 on Melody Maker's list of 1996's 'Albums Of The Year'. The [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that \"Snoop still is one of rap's most electrifying performers. But unlike \"[[Doggystyle]]\" and the \"[[Murder Was the Case]]\" soundtrack, few of the beats on this album rival his rapping prowess.\" They complimented some of the tracks, calling 'Doggfather' \"... the epitome of cool smoothness. Over a slow-rolling Daz and DJ Pooh track\" 'Freestyle Conversation' \"...an Outkast-style exercise in which Snoop speaks a mile a minute, but still manages to maintain a funky rhythm\", 'Gold Rush' a \"funky pistolero track\" and the [[Biz Markie]] remake '[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]' \"the album's real gem\". The review went on to conclude that \"Tha Doggfather may not be Doggystyle, but Snoop shows that he has the prowess and the talent to survive.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/entertainment/ca-63105_1_tha-doggfather& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Snoop Still Has Some Bite | date=November 10, 1996}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted that the album would chart in the top ten due to his presence in the music industry. They also stated that \"The album has a few obligatory mentions of sexual exploits and gun-toting, usually delegated to guest rappers. But most of the raps are about his position as a hit-maker. He still has one of the most distinctive deliveries in rap: a casual, nasal, conversational tone that sounds leisurely even when he's barreling forward. His producers are a little less slick than Dr. Dre was, but they have supplied swampy bass riffs and catchy backup choruses, drawing heavily (like Dr. Dre) on George Clinton's P-Funk. Snoop Doggy Dogg insists, and ''Tha Doggfather'' does that, maintaining a party atmosphere.

But also praised the album by stating \"Though the music isn't original, and the lyrics break no new territory, the execution is strong -- Snoop's rapping and rhyming continue to improve, while the bass-heavy funk is often intoxicating.\" He ended the review stating \"...the album is a fine follow-up to one of the most successful hip-hop albums in history.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nBefore the release of the album many were questioning if the album would become lost in the turmoil and tragedy of the label, or even to be bypassed in the rush of Tupac's [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory|posthumous album]].

It was released on November 12, 1996, by [[Death Row Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. After the success of his debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993), Snoop was charged with murder and in 1995, spent time preparing for the case that went to trial. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album without [[Dr. Dre]] providing work as a [[record producer]]. This was Snoop's final album on Death Row Records under his name of ''Snoop Doggy Dogg''. Recording sessions took place from February 1996 to October 1996, with [[Suge Knight]] filling in as the [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] on the album, alongside the additional production from several [[record producer]]s such as [[DJ Pooh]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Soopafly]] and [[L.T. Hutton]]; as well as [[guest appearance]]s from [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]], [[Tray Dee]] and [[Warren G]], among others.\n\nThe album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996, selling over 420,000 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of ''Doggystyle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&dq=snoop+dogg+bubbling+under&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilscbQ97XNAhXFh5AKHQIPAaIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20bubbling%20under&f=false |title=Billboard magazine - August 22, 1998 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> [[Dr. Dre]] had left Death Row to his partner [[Suge Knight]], who was indicted for racketeering by the end of 1996. ''Tha Doggfather'' was also released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', which debuted at number one. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, Snoop Dogg featured on the album ''[[The Chronic]]'' by close friend Dr. Dre, which was a great success.\n\nIn 1993, Snoop and Dr. Dre began work on ''Doggystyle'' which was also very popular and acclaimed. During the recording of ''Doggystyle'' Snoop became a defendant in a murder case which saw his acquittal shortly before this album was released, which led him to no longer live the \"gangsta\" lifestyle he portrayed in his records.\n\nDr. Dre, who was Death Row Records' in-house producer, had left earlier in 1996 to start [[Aftermath Entertainment|his own label]], which led Snoop's first cousin Daz Dillinger to become Death Row's head producer; he worked on this record. The [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murder of Snoop's close friend and fellow rapper, label-mate Tupac Shakur]] in September 1996 also weighed on him heavily; Shakur appears on the closing track \"Outro\", under the name \"Makaveli\", which he began using a short while before his death. \n\n==Release==\n''Tha Doggfather'' charted at number one on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. To date, the album sold two million copies in the United States and sold better internationally than its predecessor, \"Doggystyle\" (1993).\n\n==Music==\n\n===Production===\nDuring the departure of Dr. Dre from Death Row Records, the majority of this album was produced and mixed by [[DJ Pooh]]. In addition to DJ Pooh, Daz Dillinger and several other producers contributed to this album. In 1996, in an interview with [[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]], Snoop Dogg revealed that he had been working with Dr. Dre for this album; however, he had been prevented from doing so by Suge Knight. The album samples songs such as \"It's Like That\" performed by [[Run-D.M.C.]], \"[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]\" performed by [[Biz Markie]], \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" performed by [[Zapp & Roger]], and \"[[Oops Upside Your Head]]\" performed by [[The Gap Band]]. The Doggfather also marked the debut of Snoop Dogg as a [[record producer]] on the track \"(O.J.) Wake Up\". Snoop Dogg also was beginning to be acknowledged on how to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] by a high-profile producer named [[L.T. Hutton]], who led a hand providing some production on that track as well.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSDVUq8HaY |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 2) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe illustration on the back cover of the CD was done by Joe Cool, the same artist who did the front cover of Snoop's previous album ''Doggystyle''.\n\n===Lyrics===\nCompared to Doggystyle, the lyrics are much less violent and controversial. On ''Tha Doggfather'', Snoop Dogg wanted to present a more positive image in his lyrics, a reflection of his maturation as an artist and as a new father.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-CVjntHlA |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 1) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> On December 3, 2006, in an interview with [[Vh1]], Snoop Dogg revealed the differences between ''Doggystyle'' and ''Tha Doggfather'', stating, \"I think ''Tha Doggfather'' was a rebirth of me, as far as me being more positive on what I was tryin' to say and, you know, tryin' to live the life through my music, instead of me just livin' my life, tryin' to show people that my life... wasn't like my music...I'm not gonna glorify none of this negativity that Death Row wanted me to do. I'm gonna bring a positive side of music.\" Although his new lyrical direction was met with mixed feelings from fans and critics alike, Snoop Dogg still thinks of the album as a success: \"I enjoyed it and everywhere I go around the world people, you know, I sign more Doggfather records than any other record I put out. That's the one I sign the most and I'm proud at the thang I did and the thang is... sometimes you can outgrow your fans\".<ref>{{cite video |url=http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/122939/on-the-doggfather.jhtml#artist=1133 |title=On \"Tha Doggfather\" by Snoop Dogg |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]] \n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r244077|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''Tha Doggfather'' |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev2Score = B+<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295271,00.html |title=Music Review: 'Tha Doggfather' (1996) |first=J.D. |last=Considine |authorlink=J.D.

In a February issue of [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine, Dr. Dre stated his feelings on the album and said \"But to be perfectly honest, I don't like Snoop's new album. And it has nothing to do with me not working him, because I'm just like everybody else: I like it, or I don't. The first time I heard the single, I was grooving to it, but then I really started to get into the production and how it was sounding, you know?

[[Melody Maker]] ranked it #49 on Melody Maker's list of 1996's 'Albums Of The Year'. The [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that \"Snoop still is one of rap's most electrifying performers. But unlike \"[[Doggystyle]]\" and the \"[[Murder Was the Case]]\" soundtrack, few of the beats on this album rival his rapping prowess.\" They complimented some of the tracks, calling 'Doggfather' \"... the epitome of cool smoothness. Over a slow-rolling Daz and DJ Pooh track\" 'Freestyle Conversation' \"...an Outkast-style exercise in which Snoop speaks a mile a minute, but still manages to maintain a funky rhythm\", 'Gold Rush' a \"funky pistolero track\" and the [[Biz Markie]] remake '[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]' \"the album's real gem\". The review went on to conclude that \"Tha Doggfather may not be Doggystyle, but Snoop shows that he has the prowess and the talent to survive.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/entertainment/ca-63105_1_tha-doggfather& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Snoop Still Has Some Bite | date=November 10, 1996}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted that the album would chart in the top ten due to his presence in the music industry. They also stated that \"The album has a few obligatory mentions of sexual exploits and gun-toting, usually delegated to guest rappers. But most of the raps are about his position as a hit-maker. He still has one of the most distinctive deliveries in rap: a casual, nasal, conversational tone that sounds leisurely even when he's barreling forward. His producers are a little less slick than Dr. Dre was, but they have supplied swampy bass riffs and catchy backup choruses, drawing heavily (like Dr. Dre) on George Clinton's P-Funk. Snoop Doggy Dogg insists, and ''Tha Doggfather'' does that, maintaining a party atmosphere. Yet while it insists that gangsta rap isn't dead, it plays down tough-guy tales in favor of a star's pronouncements.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/arts/machismo-in-rap-atop-the-charts.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Machismo In Rap Atop The Charts | date=November 26, 1996}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the album runs on too long at over 70 minutes and \"Though it works the same G-funk territory, the bass is less elastic and there is considerably less sonic detail\". But also praised the album by stating \"Though the music isn't original, and the lyrics break no new territory, the execution is strong -- Snoop's rapping and rhyming continue to improve, while the bass-heavy funk is often intoxicating.\" He ended the review stating \"...the album is a fine follow-up to one of the most successful hip-hop albums in history.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nBefore the release of the album many were questioning if the album would become lost in the turmoil and tragedy of the label, or even to be bypassed in the rush of Tupac's [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory|posthumous album]]. However retailers thought differently such as Violet Brown, urban music buyer for the Wherehouse music chain. \"Customer anticipation has been huge. As soon as record executives found out they were opening against Snoop [this week], they shifted the release dates of some rival rap albums to avoid the Snoop sales rush.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-11/entertainment/ca-63540_1_executive-vice-president& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Ready, Set . . .

While falling short of Doggystyle's 803,000 in the first week sold (the record at the time for a rap album), the album still was the third-highest rap debut of that year behind Shakur's \"[[All Eyez on Me]]\" (566,000 first-week copies) and \"Killuminati\" (664,000 copies), and it ranks fourth overall on the year's list of top debuts, which is headed by [[Metallica]]'s \"Load\" (680,000 copies).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-21/entertainment/ca-1151_1_tupac-shakur& | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Shauna | last=Snow | title=Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and international news services and the nation's press | date=November 21, 1996}}</ref> The album has sold over two million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA104&dq=death+row+soundscan&hl=en&ei=VZ9NTqu8KefkiAKP1pVw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=death%20row%20soundscan&f=false& |title=Knight Moves |date=October 2001 |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |page=104 |location=New York |publisher=InterMedia Partners |issn=1070-4701 |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n| total_length = \n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title1  = Intro\n| note1 = \n| writer1 = \n| extra1 = \n| length1 = 0:46\n\n| title2  = [[Doggfather]]\n| note2 = featuring [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]]\n| writer2 = [[Snoop Dogg|Calvin Broadus, Jr.]], [[Daz Dillinger|Delmar Arnaud]]\n| extra2 = [[Daz Dillinger|Dat Nigga Daz]]\n| length2 = 3:57\n\n| title3 = Ride 4 Me\n| note3 = \n| writer3 = Broadus, Jr., Ralph Aiken, Tyrone Crum, Keith Harrison, Robert Neal, Jr., Roger Parker, Clarence Satchell\n| extra3 = \n| length3 = 1:01\n\n| title4 = Up Jump tha Boogie\n| note4 = featuring [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]] \n| writer4 = Broadus, Jr., [[Kurupt|Ricardo Brown]], [[DJ Pooh|Mark Jordan]]\n| extra4 = [[DJ Pooh]]\n| length4 = 4:43\n\n| title5  = Freestyle Conversation\n| note5 = \n| writer5 = Broadus, Jr., [[Soopafly|Priest Brooks]]\n| extra5 = [[Soopafly]]\n| length5 = 4:17\n\n| title6  = When I Grow Up\n| note6 = \n| writer6 = Broadus, Jr.\n| extra6 = \n| length6 = 0:37\n\n| title7  = Snoop Bounce\n| note7 = featuring Charlie Wilson\n| writer7 = Broadus, Jr., Jordan, [[Roger Troutman]]\n| extra7 = DJ Pooh\n| length7  = 4:03\n\n| title8 = Gold Rush\n| note8 = featuring Kurupt tha Kingpin and [[LBC Crew]]\n| writer8 = Broadus, Jr., Brown, [[Bad Azz (rapper)|Jamarr Stamps]], David Williams, Reggie Vanterpool, Ralph Wheeler\n| extra8 = Arkim & Flair\n| length8 = 4:52\n\n| title9 = (Tear 'Em Off) Me and My Doggz\n| note9 = \n| writer9 = Broadus, Jr., D.
