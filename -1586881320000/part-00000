{"title_page": "Gastric acid", "text_new": "'''Gastric acid''', '''gastric juice''', or '''stomach acid''', is a digestive fluid formed within the [[gastric mucosa|stomach lining]]. Composed of [[hydrochloric acid]], [[potassium chloride]], and [[sodium chloride]], gastric acid plays a key role in digestion of [[protein]]s by activating [[digestive enzyme]]s, which together break down the [[Amino_acid#General_structure|long chains of amino acids of proteins]]. Gastric acid is regulated in feedback systems to increase production when needed, such as after a meal. Other cells in the stomach produce [[bicarbonate]], a base, to [[Buffering agent|buffer]] the fluid, ensuring a regulated [[pH]]. These cells also produce [[mucus]] &ndash; a [[viscosity|viscous]] barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The [[pancreas]] further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the [[pancreatic duct]] to the [[duodenum]] to neutralize gastric acid passing into the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]].\n\nThe main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid produced by parietal cells in the [[gastric glands]] in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called [[Canaliculus (parietal cell)|canaliculi]]) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen, a level maintained by the [[proton pump]] [[hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]].<ref>{{cite book |authors=Elaine N.

The [[parasympathetic nervous system]], via the [[vagus nerve]], and the hormone [[gastrin]] stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone [[histamine]] from [[enterochromaffine-like cell]]s (ECL). [[Vasoactive intestinal peptide]], [[cholecystokinin]], and [[secretin]] all inhibit production.\n\nThe production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and [[negative feedback]] mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, [[G cell]]s, [[D cell (biology)|D cell]]s and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.\n\nNerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory [[neurotransmitter]]s: [[acetylcholine]] and [[gastrin-releasing peptide]]. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.\n\nThe release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by [[somatostatin]].\n\n==Neutralization==\nIn the [[duodenum]], gastric acid is [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] by [[sodium bicarbonate]]. This also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of [[pH]]. The secretion of sodium bicarbonate from the [[pancreas]] is stimulated by [[secretin]]. This [[polypeptide]] hormone gets activated and secreted from so-called [[S cell]]s in the mucosa of the duodenum and [[jejunum]] when the pH in the duodenum falls below 4.5 to 5.0.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
