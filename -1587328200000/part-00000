Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her youngest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a [[Recess (break)|recess]] to listen to both mother and son in private.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\nLyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany,<ref name=\"Houdini\"/> but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including [[Dan Kerrigan]]'s infamous [[6th Street (Manhattan)|Sixth Street]] saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]]. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\n===Last days in New York===\nLyons spent much of the 1890s in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry.

Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by [[store detective]] Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a [[streetcar]], where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached [[18th Street (Manhattan)|Eighteenth Street]], Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest.\n\nLyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in [[New Jersey]], which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be [[Remand (detention)|remanded]]. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E6D71338E233A25751C2A9609C94679ED7CF \"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 1896</ref>\n\n===Retirement and later years===\nFollowing her \"retirement\" from crime in 1913, Lyons eventually settled in Detroit, where she wrote her memoir, ''Why Crime Does Not Pay'', and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000<ref>\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 13, 1913</ref> (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents.\n\nThe Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \"character building\" facility at [[Lafayette Boulevard]] on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F6355C13738DDDAA0894DA405B868DF1D3 \"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\"]. ''[[The New York Times]], February 3, 1916</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, the 73-year-old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,000{{ndash}}7,000 in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to [[Put-in-Bay]] to find her house \"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in [[Seattle]].

Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her youngest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a [[Recess (break)|recess]] to listen to both mother and son in private.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\nLyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany,<ref name=\"Houdini\"/> but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including [[Dan Kerrigan]]'s infamous [[6th Street (Manhattan)|Sixth Street]] saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]]. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\n===Last days in New York===\nLyons spent much of the 1890s in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry. She returned to New York in 1895 and, after her arrest by police detective Stephen O'Brien,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46603156/detectives-in-new-jobs/ |title=Detectives In New Jobs; Important Changes Made in the Bureau at Headquarters.

Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by [[store detective]] Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a [[streetcar]], where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached [[18th Street (Manhattan)|Eighteenth Street]], Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest.\n\nLyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in [[New Jersey]], which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be [[Remand (detention)|remanded]]. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E6D71338E233A25751C2A9609C94679ED7CF \"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 1896</ref>\n\n===Retirement and later years===\nFollowing her \"retirement\" from crime in 1913, Lyons eventually settled in Detroit, where she wrote her memoir, ''Why Crime Does Not Pay'', and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000<ref>\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 13, 1913</ref> (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents.\n\nThe Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \"character building\" facility at [[Lafayette Boulevard]] on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F6355C13738DDDAA0894DA405B868DF1D3 \"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\"]. ''[[The New York Times]], February 3, 1916</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, the 73-year-old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,000{{ndash}}7,000 in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to [[Put-in-Bay]] to find her house \"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in [[Seattle]]. She commented to reporters, \"I have no idea who did the 'job,' and I am unhappy to think that men would do such a thing to an old woman who devotes a large income to prison relief work.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17448997/sophie-lyons-detroit-home-robbed/ |title=Rob Ex-Confidence Woman; Burglars Sack Sophie L.

They presented their plan (in competition with two other proposals) in 1961; it was approved 24 May 1963. The statue of the Virgin was moved to Almonte 16 June 1963 in preparation for the demolition of the second hermitage, where demolition began in July. The cornerstone of the new building was laid 26 January 1964; a provisional chapel was constructed and in service 33 days later. Major construction continued until 10 January 1969, and after torrential rains prevented a planned [[benediction]] on 15 March, the benediction of the new hermitage took place 12 April 1969.<ref name=herm2/>\n\nHowever, even in 1969 the building was not complete in all respects, and some further construction, including the upper portion of the fa\u00e7ade, continued until 1980, when the cross was placed atop the building.

There are over 100 variants of the MP5,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/military/products/submachine-guns/mp5/mp5/overview.html |title=H&K Web site, MP5 overview |publisher=Heckler-koch.com |accessdate=2012-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119043103/http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/military/products/submachine-guns/mp5/mp5/overview.html |archive-date=2013-01-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> including some semi-automatic versions.\n\nThe MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world,<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''. Jane's Information Group. {{ISBN|0-00-712760-X}}.</ref> having been adopted by 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, intelligence, and security organizations.{{sfn|Tilstra|2012|p=42}} It was widely used by [[SWAT]] teams in North America, but has largely been supplanted by M16 variants in the 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Heckler & Koch developed the [[Heckler & Koch UMP]], the MP5's successor;{{sfn|Dockery|2007|p=220}} both are available {{As of|2019|lc=on}}. However,  it was not met with the same level of success.\n\n==History==\nHeckler & Koch, encouraged by the success of the [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] [[automatic rifle]], developed a family of small arms consisting of four types of [[firearm]]s all based on a common G3 design layout and operating principle.  The first type was chambered for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], the second for the [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43]] round, the third for the intermediate [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] caliber, and the fourth type for the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] [[pistol]] cartridge. The MP5 was created within the fourth group of firearms and was initially known as the '''HK54'''.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}}\n\nWork on the MP5 began in 1964 and two years later it was adopted by the [[German Federal Police]], border guard and army special forces, referring to as the \"MP64\" or later \"MP5\".{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}} The MP5A1 was introduced in the late '60s, which the first model to have the iconic ring front sight and the slimline handguard. In 1970, the MP5A2 and MP5A3 was introduced. It also had its first film \"The Millions Games\" released on October 18, 1970. In 1974, the MP5SD was introduced, which is a suppressed variant of the MP5. It was used in the Vietnam War in 1975 by the Green Berets. In 1976, the MP5K was introduced as a request for a variant for South America. In 1977, the Standard Curved was introduced for the MP5A2 and MP5A3 design. In 1978, the Tropical forearm was introduced to be produced with the MP5.\n\nIn 1980, the MP5 achieved iconic status as a result of its use on live television by SAS commandos in [[Operation Nimrod]], where they stormed the Iranian Embassy in London, rescuing hostages and killing five terrorists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mcaleese-leader-of-the-sas-team-that-ended-the-1980-siege-of-the-iranian-embassy-in-london-2345827.html |title=John McAleese: Leader of the SAS team that ended the 1980 siege of the |date=2011-08-30 |access-date=2019-07-27 |language=en}}</ref> The MP5 has become a mainstay of [[SWAT]] units of law enforcement agencies in the United States since then. However, in the late 1990s, as a result of the [[North Hollywood shootout]], police special response teams have supplanted most MP5s with [[AR-15]]-based rifles.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/november/swat111708 |title=Tools of the Trade - SWAT |access-date=2019-07-27 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe MP5 is manufactured under license in several nations including Greece (formerly at EBO \u2013 [[Hellenic Arms Industry]], currently at [[\u0395\u0391\u03a3 (weapons)|\u0395\u0391\u03a3 \u2013 Hellenic Defense Systems]]), [[Iran]] ([[Defense Industries Organization]]), Mexico ([[SEDENA]]), [[Pakistan]] ([[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]]), [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]] ([[Military Industry Corporation]]), [[Turkey]] ([[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKEK]]), and the United Kingdom (initially at [[Royal Ordnance]], later diverted to Heckler & Koch Great Britain).<ref name=\"worldpolicy2000\">{{cite web |url=https://worldpolicy.org/2009/11/13/report-profiling-the-small-arms-industry-world-policy-institute-research-project/ |title=Report: Profiling the Small Arms Industry |date=November 2000 |publisher=World Policy Institute |access-date=2010-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105944/https://worldpolicy.org/2009/11/13/report-profiling-the-small-arms-industry-world-policy-institute-research-project/ |archive-date=2018-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Design details ==\nThe primary version of the MP5 family is the '''MP5A2''', which is a lightweight, air-cooled, [[selective fire]] [[Roller-delayed blowback|delayed blowback]] operated [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] weapon with a roller-delayed bolt. It fires from a [[closed bolt]] (bolt forward) position.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=12}}\n\nThe fixed, [[Free-floating barrel|free floating]], cold hammer-forged barrel has 6 right-hand grooves with a 1 in 250&nbsp;mm (1:10 in) [[rifling]] twist rate and is pressed and pinned into the receiver.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Visierlinie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A view through the weapon's aperture sight]]\nThe first MP5 models used a double-column straight [[box magazine]], but since 1977, slightly curved, [[steel]] magazines are used with a 15-round capacity (weighing 0.12&nbsp;kg) or a 30-round capacity (0.17&nbsp;kg empty).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe adjustable [[iron sight]]s (closed type) consist of a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the use of a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at {{convert|25|m|yd|0}} with standard {{convert|8|g|gr|0}} FMJ 9\u00d719mm NATO ammunition. The rear sight drum provides four apertures of varying diameters used to adjust the diopter system, according to the user's preference and tactical situation.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}} Changing between apertures does not change the point of impact down range. For accurate shooting the user should select the smallest aperture that still allows an equal circle of light between the rear sight aperture and the outside of the front sight hood ring.\n[[File:HK MP5 Zeichen.JPG|left|thumb|upright|MP5 insignia]]\nThe MP5 has a hammer firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an interchangeable [[polymer]] trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and equipped with a three-position fire mode selector that serves as the manual safety toggle. The \"S\" or ''Sicher'' position in white denotes weapon safe, \"E\" or ''Einzelfeuer'' in red represents single fire, and \"F\" or ''Feuersto\u00df'' (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear on both sides of the plastic trigger group. The selector lever is actuated with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The \"safe\" setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe non-reciprocating [[cocking handle]] is located above the handguard and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle. This rigid control is attached to a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a [[forward assist]] to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front end of the cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Operating mechanism ===\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|left|The roller-delayed blowback mechanism originated from the aborted [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototypes developed in [[Nazi Germany]] at the end of [[World War II]].]]\nThe bolt rigidly engages the barrel extension\u2014a cylindrical component welded to the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] into which the barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the [[G3 rifle]]. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nWhen fired, expanding propellant gases produced from the burning powder in the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through the base of the cartridge case as it is propelled out of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the locking piece. The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the locking piece produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nThe delay results from the amount of time it takes for enough recoil energy to be transferred through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber for a short period of time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4&nbsp;mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nSince the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge is relatively low powered, the bolt does not have an anti-bounce device like the G3, but instead the bolt carrier contains {{convert|32.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} of [[tungsten]] granules that prevent the bolt group from bouncing back after impacting the barrel extension. The weapon has a fluted chamber that enhances extraction reliability by bleeding gases backwards into the shallow flutes running along the length of the chamber to prevent the cartridge case from expanding and sticking to the chamber walls (since the bolt is opened under relatively high barrel pressure). A spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and holds the case securely until it strikes the ejector arm and is thrown out of the ejection port to the right of the receiver. The lever-type ejector is located inside the trigger housing (activated by the movement of the recoiling bolt).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\n=== Accessories ===\nIn the early 1970s, [[Heckler & Koch|HK]] introduced a conversion kit for the MP5 that enables it to use rimfire ammunition ([[.22 LR]]). This unit consists of a barrel insert, a bolt group and two 20-round magazines. This modification reduces the cyclic rate to 650 rounds/min. It was sold mostly to law enforcement agencies as a way to train recruits on handling the MP5. It used ammunition that was cheaper and had a lower recoil than 9\u00d719mm Parabellum. This reduced training costs and built up skill and confidence in the operators before transitioning them to the full-bore model.\n\n====Barrel accessories====\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|left|Cross section diagram of an MP5SD early model suppressor, from 1971 patent. Vented barrel surrounded by metal mesh packing in the expansion chambers, followed by conical baffles in the forward chambers.]]\nThreading is provided at the muzzle to work with certain muzzle devices made by Heckler & Koch, including: a slotted [[flash suppressor]], [[blank-firing adaptor|blank firing attachment]] (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with blank ammunition only), an adapter for launching [[rifle grenade]]s (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22&nbsp;mm using a special grenade launching cartridge) and a cup-type attachment used to launch [[tear gas]] grenades. An optional three-lugged barrel is also available for mounting a quick-detachable [[suppressor]].\n\n====Receiver====\nThe receiver housing has a proprietary claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment of a standard Heckler & Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], [[Heckler & Koch HK33|HK33]] and [[G3SG/1]]). It can be used to mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4\u00d724), night sights, reflex sights and [[laser]] pointers. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached to the top of the receiver.\n\nA [[Picatinny rail]] adapter can be placed on top that locks into the claw rails. This allows the mounting of [[Standardization Agreement|STANAG]] scopes and has a lower profile than the claw-rail system.\n\n====Handguard====\nAftermarket replacement handguards with [[Picatinny rail]]s are available. Single-rail models have a Picatinny rail along the bottom and triple-rail models have rails along the bottom and sides. They allow the mounting of accessories like flashlights, laser pointers, target designators, vertical foregrips, and bipods.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=24}}\n\n== Variants ==\nThe MP5A2 has a fixed buttstock (made of a synthetic polymer), whereas the compact ''MP5A3'' has a retractable metal stock. The stockless ''MP5A1'' has a buttcap with a sling mount for concealed carry; the MP5K series was a further development of this idea.{{sfn|Cutshaw|2011|p=154}}\n\nThe ''MP5A4'' (fixed stock) and ''MP5A5'' (sliding stock) models, which were introduced in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the ''MP5A1'', ''MP5A2'', and ''MP5A3''. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present on each side of the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.\n\nA variant with the last trigger group designated the '''MP5-N''' (N\u2014Navy) was developed in 1986 for the [[United States Navy]]. This model has a collapsible stock, a [[tritium]]-illuminated front sight post and a {{convert|225|mm|abbr=on|1}} threaded barrel for use with a [[stainless steel]] [[suppressor|sound suppressor]] made by [[Knight's Armament Company]] together with quieter subsonic ammunition. It had ambidextrous controls, a straight pistol grip, pictogram markings, and originally had a four-position selector (Safe, Semi-Auto, 3-Round Burst, Full Auto). This was replaced with a similar three-position ambidextrous selector after an improperly-reassembled trigger group spontaneously fired during an exercise. The \"Navy\"-style ambidextrous trigger group later became standard, replacing the classic \"SEF\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Trigger group\n|-\n! Type !! Positions !! Settings !!

These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their cocking handles and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various buttstocks and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Semi-auto ===\n[[File:Police.gun.1.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Authorised Firearms Officers standing guard at the entrance to Downing Street, London, home of the UK Prime Minister. This officer is attached to the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and is carrying a semi-auto MP5SFA3.]]\nThe ''MP5SFA2'' (SF \u2013 single-fire) was developed in 1986 in response to the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] solicitation for a \"9&nbsp;mm Single-fire Carbine\". It is the same as the MP5A2 but is fitted with an ambidextrous semi-automatic only trigger group. The ''MP5SFA3'' is similar except it has a retractable metal stock like the MP5A3. Versions delivered after December 1991 are assembled with select-fire bolt carriers allowing fully automatic operation when used with the appropriate trigger module.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=47}}\n\nThe semi-automatic \"MP5SF\" models are widely used by British police forces including London's  [[Metropolitan Police Service]] [[Specialist Firearms Command]], [[Diplomatic Protection Group]], [[Authorised firearms officer]]s, and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] to name a few.\n\nThe two-position trigger unit was used in the single-fire ''HK94'' [[carbine]] that was produced specifically for the civilian market with a {{convert|420|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Suppressed ===\nIn 1974, H&K initiated design work on a sound-suppressed variant of the MP5, designated the '''MP5SD''' (SD\u2014''Schalld\u00e4mpfer'', German for \"sound suppressor\"), which features an integral but detachable [[aluminium]] sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. The weapon's {{convert|146|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel has 30 {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel's external surface just prior to the ported segment. The suppressor itself is divided into two stages; the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second, decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped metal [[helix]] separator with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic [[shock wave]] in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel's length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet's muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon's automation and reliability. The weapon was designed to be used with standard supersonic ammunition with the suppressor on at all times.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe MP5SD is produced exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a receiver end cap instead of a buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group\u2014a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous selector controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy\u2014designated the MP5SD-N, which is a version of the MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=5}}\n\n=== MP5K ===\nIn 1976, a shortened [[machine pistol]] version of the MP5A2 was introduced; the ''MP5K'' (K from the German word ''Kurz'' = \"short\") was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock (the receiver end was covered with a flat end cap, featuring a buffer on the inside and a sling loop on the outside), and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nThe MP5K is produced (by Heckler & Koch and under license in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]) in four different versions: the MP5K, ''MP5KA4'', ''MP5KA1'', ''MP5KA5'', where the first two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants \u2013 fixed open sights; however, the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights through the use of an adapter.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nA civilian semiautomatic derivative of the MP5K known as the '''SP89''' was produced that had a foregrip with a muzzle guard in place of the vertical grip.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n\nIn 1991, a further variant of the MP5K was developed, designated the ''MP5K-PDW'' (PDW\u2014Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a \"Navy\" trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=20}}\n\n=== Larger caliber ===\nIn 1992, Heckler & Koch introduced the ''MP5/10'' (chambered in [[10mm Auto]]) and ''MP5/40'' (chambered for the [[.40 S&W]] cartridge), which are based on the MP5A4 and MP5A5. These weapons were assembled in fixed and retractable stock configurations (without a separate designation) and are fed from translucent 30-round polymer box magazines. These weapons include a bolt hold-open device, which captures the bolt group in its rear position after expending the last cartridge from the magazine. The bolt is then released by pressing a lever positioned on the left side of the receiver. Both weapons use a barrel with 6 right-hand grooves and a 380&nbsp;mm (1:15 in) twist rate, and like the MP5-N, both have a 3-lugged muzzle device and a tritium-illuminated front sight aiming dot.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\nProblems with the MP5/10 and MP5/40 led to their discontinuation in 2000, although Heckler & Koch continues to provide support and spare parts.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\n=== List ===\n[[File:Hkmp5k.jpg|thumb|upright|MP5K]]\n[[File:MP5A3.jpg|thumb|upright|MP5A3]]\n[[File:MP5K Submachine Gun (7414624602).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MP5K-PDW (early prototype, lacking 'Navy' trigger group and lugged barrel).]]\n[[File:Heckler Koch MP5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MP5SD3.]]\n\n* '''HK54''': The original model that was produced in 1964. The ''54'' designation is from the Heckler & Koch company's old system that indicates that it is a submachine gun/assault carbine (5-) chambered for the 9\u00d719mm cartridge (-4). It had a charcoal-gray phosphated finish rather than the matte-black lacquered finish used on later models and had narrow slotted metal handguards. Its major differences were that it had a longer and heavier bolt carrier than the MP5 and a flip up \"ladder\"-style rear sight (like the early G3 rifle) rather than the MP5's aperture sight. Its original 15- or 30-round steel magazines were straight rather than curved, had a plastic follower, and were reinforced with ribs (thus their nickname of \"waffle\"-type magazines).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n* '''MP5''': A slightly modified version of the HK54 first created in 1966. A matte-black lacquered finish instead of the grayish phosphated finish was introduced for export models in 1977. It originally had the narrow checkered metal \"Slimline\" handguards in the place of the HK54's narrow slotted metal ones. These were later replaced by the thicker \"Tropical\" handguards in 1978. The proprietary Heckler & Koch \"claw mount\" rails for mounting optical and electronic scopes were added around 1973. The improved 15- and 30-round magazines were adopted in 1977; they were curved, had unribbed sides, and had chromed-steel followers.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n**'''MP5A1''': No buttstock (endplate/receiver cap in place of buttstock), \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A2''': Fixed buttstock, \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA2''': Fixed buttstock, single-fire (SE) trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A3''': Retractable buttstock,\"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA3''': Semi-automatic carbine version of MP5A3.

[2.92&nbsp;kg.]. In 1991, the state of [[California]] imported 420 HK-94A2s, mostly for their state [[California Department of Corrections|Department of Corrections]]; it was the last batch of HK-94s imported into the United States.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n**The '''HK94A3''' had a retractable stock, an overall length of 27.58 inches [700&nbsp;mm] collapsed and 34.05 inches [865&nbsp;mm] extended and weighed 7.18&nbsp;lbs. [3.26&nbsp;kg].{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n**The '''HK94/SG-1''' (''Scharfsch\u00fctzengewehr'', \"sharp-shooting rifle\") was designed for short-range sniping in built-up areas like cities or prisons. It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 \u00d7 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope. It had an overall length of 40.39 inches [1026mm] and a weight of 9.25&nbsp;lbs. [4.2&nbsp;kg]. Its mean standard retail price (MSRP) in 1986 was US$1,525; this was more than twice what a stock HK94A2 (US$650) or HK94A3 (US$720) cost. Only 50 were imported into the United States; authentic models have serial numbers running in the 43XX range.<br>As an aftermarket modification, a PSG-1 trigger pack with target pistol grip and match trigger could be added by a gunsmith by changing the ejector and hammer spring. The 6\u00d7 Leupold scope was calibrated for .223 Remington rounds, so other scopes were often substituted.\n* '''SP89''': ''Sportpistole M1989''.

There are over 100 variants of the MP5,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/military/products/submachine-guns/mp5/mp5/overview.html |title=H&K Web site, MP5 overview |publisher=Heckler-koch.com |accessdate=2012-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119043103/http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/military/products/submachine-guns/mp5/mp5/overview.html |archive-date=2013-01-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> including some semi-automatic versions.\n\nThe MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world,<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''. Jane's Information Group. {{ISBN|0-00-712760-X}}.</ref> having been adopted by 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, intelligence, and security organizations.{{sfn|Tilstra|2012|p=42}} It was widely used by [[SWAT]] teams in North America, but has largely been supplanted by M16 variants in the 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Heckler & Koch developed the [[Heckler & Koch UMP]], the MP5's successor;{{sfn|Dockery|2007|p=220}} both are available {{As of|2019|lc=on}}. However,  it was not met with the same level of success.\n\n==History==\nHeckler & Koch, encouraged by the success of the [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] [[automatic rifle]], developed a family of small arms consisting of four types of [[firearm]]s all based on a common G3 design layout and operating principle.  The first type was chambered for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], the second for the [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43]] round, the third for the intermediate [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] caliber, and the fourth type for the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] [[pistol]] cartridge. The MP5 was created within the fourth group of firearms and was initially known as the '''HK54'''.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}}\n\nWork on the MP5 began in 1964 and two years later it was adopted by the [[German Federal Police]], border guard and army special forces, referring to as the \"MP64\" or later \"MP5\".{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}} The MP5A1 was introduced in the late '60s, which the first model to have the iconic ring front sight and the slimline handguard. In 1970, the MP5A2 and MP5A3 was introduced. It also had its first film \"The Millions Games\" released on October 18, 1970. In 1974, the MP5SD was introduced, which is a suppressed variant of the MP5. It was used in the Vietnam War in 1975 by the Green Berets. In 1976, the MP5K was introduced as a request for a variant for South America. In 1977, the Standard Curved was introduced for the MP5A2 and MP5A3 design. In 1978, the Tropical forearm was introduced to be produced with the MP5.\n\nIn 1980, the MP5 achieved iconic status as a result of its use on live television by SAS commandos in [[Operation Nimrod]], where they stormed the Iranian Embassy in London, rescuing hostages and killing five terrorists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mcaleese-leader-of-the-sas-team-that-ended-the-1980-siege-of-the-iranian-embassy-in-london-2345827.html |title=John McAleese: Leader of the SAS team that ended the 1980 siege of the |date=2011-08-30 |access-date=2019-07-27 |language=en}}</ref> The MP5 has become a mainstay of [[SWAT]] units of law enforcement agencies in the United States since then. However, in the late 1990s, as a result of the [[North Hollywood shootout]], police special response teams have supplanted most MP5s with [[AR-15]]-based rifles.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/november/swat111708 |title=Tools of the Trade - SWAT |access-date=2019-07-27 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe MP5 is manufactured under license in several nations including Greece (formerly at EBO \u2013 [[Hellenic Arms Industry]], currently at [[\u0395\u0391\u03a3 (weapons)|\u0395\u0391\u03a3 \u2013 Hellenic Defense Systems]]), [[Iran]] ([[Defense Industries Organization]]), Mexico ([[SEDENA]]), [[Pakistan]] ([[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]]), [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]] ([[Military Industry Corporation]]), [[Turkey]] ([[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKEK]]), and the United Kingdom (initially at [[Royal Ordnance]], later diverted to Heckler & Koch Great Britain).<ref name=\"worldpolicy2000\">{{cite web |url=https://worldpolicy.org/2009/11/13/report-profiling-the-small-arms-industry-world-policy-institute-research-project/ |title=Report: Profiling the Small Arms Industry |date=November 2000 |publisher=World Policy Institute |access-date=2010-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105944/https://worldpolicy.org/2009/11/13/report-profiling-the-small-arms-industry-world-policy-institute-research-project/ |archive-date=2018-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Design details ==\nThe primary version of the MP5 family is the '''MP5A2''', which is a lightweight, air-cooled, [[selective fire]] [[Roller-delayed blowback|delayed blowback]] operated [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] weapon with a roller-delayed bolt. It fires from a [[closed bolt]] (bolt forward) position.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=12}}\n\nThe fixed, [[Free-floating barrel|free floating]], cold hammer-forged barrel has 6 right-hand grooves with a 1 in 250&nbsp;mm (1:10 in) [[rifling]] twist rate and is pressed and pinned into the receiver.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Visierlinie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A view through the weapon's aperture sight]]\nThe first MP5 models used a double-column straight [[box magazine]], but since 1977, slightly curved, [[steel]] magazines are used with a 15-round capacity (weighing 0.12&nbsp;kg) or a 30-round capacity (0.17&nbsp;kg empty).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe adjustable [[iron sight]]s (closed type) consist of a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the use of a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at {{convert|25|m|yd|0}} with standard {{convert|8|g|gr|0}} FMJ 9\u00d719mm NATO ammunition. The rear sight drum provides four apertures of varying diameters used to adjust the diopter system, according to the user's preference and tactical situation.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}} Changing between apertures does not change the point of impact down range. For accurate shooting the user should select the smallest aperture that still allows an equal circle of light between the rear sight aperture and the outside of the front sight hood ring.\n[[File:HK MP5 Zeichen.JPG|left|thumb|upright|MP5 insignia]]\nThe MP5 has a hammer firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an interchangeable [[polymer]] trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and equipped with a three-position fire mode selector that serves as the manual safety toggle. The \"S\" or ''Sicher'' position in white denotes weapon safe, \"E\" or ''Einzelfeuer'' in red represents single fire, and \"F\" or ''Feuersto\u00df'' (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear on both sides of the plastic trigger group. The selector lever is actuated with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The \"safe\" setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe non-reciprocating [[cocking handle]] is located above the handguard and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle. This rigid control is attached to a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a [[forward assist]] to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front end of the cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Operating mechanism ===\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|left|The roller-delayed blowback mechanism originated from the aborted [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototypes developed in [[Nazi Germany]] at the end of [[World War II]].]]\nThe bolt rigidly engages the barrel extension\u2014a cylindrical component welded to the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] into which the barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the [[G3 rifle]]. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nWhen fired, expanding propellant gases produced from the burning powder in the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through the base of the cartridge case as it is propelled out of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the locking piece. The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the locking piece produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nThe delay results from the amount of time it takes for enough recoil energy to be transferred through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber for a short period of time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4&nbsp;mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nSince the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge is relatively low powered, the bolt does not have an anti-bounce device like the G3, but instead the bolt carrier contains {{convert|32.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} of [[tungsten]] granules that prevent the bolt group from bouncing back after impacting the barrel extension. The weapon has a fluted chamber that enhances extraction reliability by bleeding gases backwards into the shallow flutes running along the length of the chamber to prevent the cartridge case from expanding and sticking to the chamber walls (since the bolt is opened under relatively high barrel pressure). A spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and holds the case securely until it strikes the ejector arm and is thrown out of the ejection port to the right of the receiver. The lever-type ejector is located inside the trigger housing (activated by the movement of the recoiling bolt).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\n=== Accessories ===\nIn the early 1970s, [[Heckler & Koch|HK]] introduced a conversion kit for the MP5 that enables it to use rimfire ammunition ([[.22 LR]]). This unit consists of a barrel insert, a bolt group and two 20-round magazines. This modification reduces the cyclic rate to 650 rounds/min. It was sold mostly to law enforcement agencies as a way to train recruits on handling the MP5. It used ammunition that was cheaper and had a lower recoil than 9\u00d719mm Parabellum. This reduced training costs and built up skill and confidence in the operators before transitioning them to the full-bore model.\n\n====Barrel accessories====\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|left|Cross section diagram of an MP5SD early model suppressor, from 1971 patent. Vented barrel surrounded by metal mesh packing in the expansion chambers, followed by conical baffles in the forward chambers.]]\nThreading is provided at the muzzle to work with certain muzzle devices made by Heckler & Koch, including: a slotted [[flash suppressor]], [[blank-firing adaptor|blank firing attachment]] (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with blank ammunition only), an adapter for launching [[rifle grenade]]s (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22&nbsp;mm using a special grenade launching cartridge) and a cup-type attachment used to launch [[tear gas]] grenades. An optional three-lugged barrel is also available for mounting a quick-detachable [[suppressor]].\n\n====Receiver====\nThe receiver housing has a proprietary claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment of a standard Heckler & Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], [[Heckler & Koch HK33|HK33]] and [[G3SG/1]]). It can be used to mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4\u00d724), night sights, reflex sights and [[laser]] pointers. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached to the top of the receiver.\n\nA [[Picatinny rail]] adapter can be placed on top that locks into the claw rails. This allows the mounting of [[Standardization Agreement|STANAG]] scopes and has a lower profile than the claw-rail system.\n\n====Handguard====\nAftermarket replacement handguards with [[Picatinny rail]]s are available. Single-rail models have a Picatinny rail along the bottom and triple-rail models have rails along the bottom and sides. They allow the mounting of accessories like flashlights, laser pointers, target designators, vertical foregrips, and bipods.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=24}}\n\n== Variants ==\nThe MP5A2 has a fixed buttstock (made of a synthetic polymer), whereas the compact ''MP5A3'' has a retractable metal stock. The stockless ''MP5A1'' has a buttcap with a sling mount for concealed carry; the MP5K series was a further development of this idea.{{sfn|Cutshaw|2011|p=154}}\n\nThe ''MP5A4'' (fixed stock) and ''MP5A5'' (sliding stock) models, which were introduced in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the ''MP5A1'', ''MP5A2'', and ''MP5A3''. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present on each side of the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.\n\nA variant with the last trigger group designated the '''MP5-N''' (N\u2014Navy) was developed in 1986 for the [[United States Navy]]. This model has a collapsible stock, a [[tritium]]-illuminated front sight post and a {{convert|225|mm|abbr=on|1}} threaded barrel for use with a [[stainless steel]] [[suppressor|sound suppressor]] made by [[Knight's Armament Company]] together with quieter subsonic ammunition. It had ambidextrous controls, a straight pistol grip, pictogram markings, and originally had a four-position selector (Safe, Semi-Auto, 3-Round Burst, Full Auto).

These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their cocking handles and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various buttstocks and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Semi-auto ===\n[[File:Police.gun.1.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Authorised Firearms Officers standing guard at the entrance to Downing Street, London, home of the UK Prime Minister. This officer is attached to the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and is carrying a semi-auto MP5SFA3.]]\nThe ''MP5SFA2'' (SF \u2013 single-fire) was developed in 1986 in response to the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] solicitation for a \"9&nbsp;mm Single-fire Carbine\". It is the same as the MP5A2 but is fitted with an ambidextrous semi-automatic only trigger group. The ''MP5SFA3'' is similar except it has a retractable metal stock like the MP5A3. Versions delivered after December 1991 are assembled with select-fire bolt carriers allowing fully automatic operation when used with the appropriate trigger module.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=47}}\n\nThe semi-automatic \"MP5SF\" models are widely used by British police forces including London's  [[Metropolitan Police Service]] [[Specialist Firearms Command]], [[Diplomatic Protection Group]], [[Authorised firearms officer]]s, and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] to name a few.\n\nThe two-position trigger unit was used in the single-fire ''HK94'' [[carbine]] that was produced specifically for the civilian market with a {{convert|420|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Suppressed ===\nIn 1974, H&K initiated design work on a sound-suppressed variant of the MP5, designated the '''MP5SD''' (SD\u2014''Schalld\u00e4mpfer'', German for \"sound suppressor\"), which features an integral but detachable [[aluminium]] sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. The weapon's {{convert|146|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel has 30 {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel's external surface just prior to the ported segment. The suppressor itself is divided into two stages; the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second, decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped metal [[helix]] separator with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic [[shock wave]] in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel's length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet's muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon's automation and reliability. The weapon was designed to be used with standard supersonic ammunition with the suppressor on at all times.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe MP5SD is produced exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a receiver end cap instead of a buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group\u2014a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous selector controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy\u2014designated the MP5SD-N, which is a version of the MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=5}}\n\n=== MP5K ===\nIn 1976, a shortened [[machine pistol]] version of the MP5A2 was introduced; the ''MP5K'' (K from the German word ''Kurz'' = \"short\") was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock (the receiver end was covered with a flat end cap, featuring a buffer on the inside and a sling loop on the outside), and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nThe MP5K is produced (by Heckler & Koch and under license in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]) in four different versions: the MP5K, ''MP5KA4'', ''MP5KA1'', ''MP5KA5'', where the first two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants \u2013 fixed open sights; however, the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights through the use of an adapter.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nA civilian semiautomatic derivative of the MP5K known as the '''SP89''' was produced that had a foregrip with a muzzle guard in place of the vertical grip.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n\nIn 1991, a further variant of the MP5K was developed, designated the ''MP5K-PDW'' (PDW\u2014Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a \"Navy\" trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=20}}\n\n=== Larger caliber ===\nIn 1992, Heckler & Koch introduced the ''MP5/10'' (chambered in [[10mm Auto]]) and ''MP5/40'' (chambered for the [[.40 S&W]] cartridge), which are based on the MP5A4 and MP5A5. These weapons were assembled in fixed and retractable stock configurations (without a separate designation) and are fed from translucent 30-round polymer box magazines. These weapons include a bolt hold-open device, which captures the bolt group in its rear position after expending the last cartridge from the magazine. The bolt is then released by pressing a lever positioned on the left side of the receiver. Both weapons use a barrel with 6 right-hand grooves and a 380&nbsp;mm (1:15 in) twist rate, and like the MP5-N, both have a 3-lugged muzzle device and a tritium-illuminated front sight aiming dot.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\nProblems with the MP5/10 and MP5/40 led to their discontinuation in 2000, although Heckler & Koch continues to provide support and spare parts.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\n=== List ===\n[[File:Hkmp5k.jpg|thumb|upright|MP5K]]\n[[File:MP5A3.jpg|thumb|upright|MP5A3]]\n[[File:MP5K Submachine Gun (7414624602).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MP5K-PDW (early prototype, lacking 'Navy' trigger group and lugged barrel).]]\n[[File:Heckler Koch MP5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MP5SD3.]]\n\n* '''HK54''': The original model that was produced in 1964.

It had a charcoal-gray phosphated finish rather than the matte-black lacquered finish used on later models and had narrow slotted metal handguards. Its major differences were that it had a longer and heavier bolt carrier than the MP5 and a flip up \"ladder\"-style rear sight (like the early G3 rifle) rather than the MP5's aperture sight. Its original 15- or 30-round steel magazines were straight rather than curved, had a plastic follower, and were reinforced with ribs (thus their nickname of \"waffle\"-type magazines).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n* '''MP5''': A slightly modified version of the HK54 first created in 1966. A matte-black lacquered finish instead of the grayish phosphated finish was introduced for export models in 1977. It originally had the narrow checkered metal \"Slimline\" handguards in the place of the HK54's narrow slotted metal ones. These were later replaced by the thicker \"Tropical\" handguards in 1978. The proprietary Heckler & Koch \"claw mount\" rails for mounting optical and electronic scopes were added around 1973. The improved 15- and 30-round magazines were adopted in 1977; they were curved, had unribbed sides, and had chromed-steel followers.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n**'''MP5A1''': No buttstock (endplate/receiver cap in place of buttstock), \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A2''': Fixed buttstock, \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA2''': Fixed buttstock, single-fire (SE) trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A3''': Retractable buttstock,\"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA3''': Semi-automatic carbine version of MP5A3.
