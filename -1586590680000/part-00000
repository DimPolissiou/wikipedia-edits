Originally associated with the Jurkin branch of the Borjigin, Muqali's father and uncles pledged allegiance to [[Temujin]] when he defeated the [[Jurchens]] of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1197. G\u00fc'\u00fcn U'a offered his son Muqali to [[Temujin]] as a personal slave (''em\u010d\u00fc bo'ol'').<ref>de Rachewiltz, I. (ed.) (1993) ''In the Service of the Khan'', Harrassowitz Verlag, Weisbaden</ref>  [[Genghis]] rewarded the defiant Muqali for his integrity and wisdom, and afterwards was a loyal companion.\n\nDuring the coronation of Genghis Khan, which seems to have been a royalist invention Muqali was given the command of the third [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] and control over the eastern [[mingghan]]s. In 1211, he played a primary role in the [[Battle of Yehuling]], the decisive battle in the first stage of the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest]] of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in northern China.\n\nAfter Genghis Khan decided to go to war with the [[Khwarazmian Empire]], he gave control of all Mongol forces to Muqali and gave him the title of King, a largely ceremonial title. Despite Genghis Khan having most of the main Mongol forces taken away and sent to the West, Muqali was able to subdue most of northern China with his small force of around 20,000 Mongols, although some historians give figures of between 40,000 and 70,000 men to account for his foreign auxilaries.\n\nIn 1217, Muqali attacked modern-day [[Hebei|Hebei Province]],northern [[Shandong|Shandong Province]], and northern [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi Province]], controlled by the [[Jin dynasty]]. This was an important agricultural area, which Muqali had largely subdued by 1219. In 1220, Muqali turned his attention to the rest of Shandong Province; four towns were captured, but the hard-pressed Jin forces managed to hold on elsewhere in the province. After suffering a number of devastating defeats by Muqali in the field, the Jin learned that they could only hope to resist him by holding their cities and outlasting Muqali's staying power.\n\nMuqali's last campaign began in 1222. He crossed the [[Wei River]] and attacked south, capturing towns that had already been plundered by a previous Mongol general, Samuqa. Meanwhile, the Jin forces launched a counter-attack in [[Shanxi|Shanxi Province]]. Muqali swiftly raced to the area; the Jin forces fled without giving battle. Besieging another town, Muqali became seriously ill and died shortly thereafter in 1223. On his deathbed, Muqali declared with pride that he had never been defeated.\n\nAfter his death, Genghis Khan gave command to Muqali's son, Bol. In seven years of campaigning in northern China, he had reduced the Jin dynasty's territories to only [[Henan|Henan Province]]. He had proven himself to be an excellent general who was indefatigable in his efforts to serve Genghis Khan. His extraordinary tenure was demonstrated by the inefficacy of other Mongol generals who failed to make any headway in China after his death. By the time of Ogedei's ascension in 1229, the Mongol detachments in China had suffered numerous setbacks, which led to a mini-revival of Jin fortunes until [[Subutai]] and [[Tolui]] were dispatched with the main Mongol army in 1232.\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, descendants of Mukhali served the [[Great Khan]] of the Mongols, especially those of the [[Tolui]]d lineage. A few of his descendants, such as [[Antong]] and Baiju, later became prominent officials in the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] fashion of the [[Yuan dynasty]] founded by Genghis Khan's grandson, [[Kublai Khan]].\n\nRetainers of the Toluid [[Hulagu]] participated in the conquest of [[Persia]], then called [[Mollai]], and later founded the [[Jalayirid]] Dynasty which ruled from [[Baghdad]] after the collapse of the Hulaguid [[Ilkhanate]].\n\nA statue of Muqali, together with [[Bo'orchu]], flanks the statue of Genghis Khan in [[Chinggis Square]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]].\n\n{{Generals and ministers of Genghis Khan}}\n\n== Descendant ==\n*[[Dorjeban]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1170 births]]\n[[Category:1223 deaths]]\n[[Category:13th-century monarchs in Asia]]\n[[Category:Generals of the Mongol Empire]]\n[[Category:Military strategists]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2015}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| name = Muqali\n| image = Statue of Mukhulai.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| alt = \n| caption = Statue of Muqali in [[S\u00fckhbaatar Square]], [[Ulaanbaatar]]\n| native_name = \u041c\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0439\n| native_name_lang = Mongolian\n| other_name = Mukhali<br>Mukhulai\n| birth_date = 1170\n| birth_place = \n| death_date = {{death year and age|1223|1170}}\n| death_place = \n| allegiance = [[Mongol Empire]]\n| serviceyears = Pre-1206 \u2013 1223\n| battles = [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty]]\n| spouse = \n| relations =\n}}\n{{Chinese|t=\u6728\u83ef\u9ece|s=\u6728\u534e\u9ece|p=M\u00f9hu\u00e1l\u00ed}}\n'''Muqali''' ({{lang-mn|\u041c\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0439}}; 1170\u20131223), also spelt '''Mukhali''' and '''Mukhulai''', was a Mongol slave (\"bo'ol\", \"one who is bound\" in service) who became a trusted and esteemed commander under [[Genghis Khan]].

(1993) ''In the Service of the Khan'', Harrassowitz Verlag, Weisbaden</ref>  [[Genghis]] rewarded the defiant Muqali for his integrity and wisdom, and afterwards was a loyal companion.\n\nDuring the coronation of Genghis Khan, which seems to have been a royalist invention Muqali was given the command of the third [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] and control over the eastern [[mingghan]]s. In 1211, he played a primary role in the [[Battle of Yehuling]], the decisive battle in the first stage of the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest]] of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in northern China.\n\nAfter Genghis Khan decided to go to war with the [[Khwarazmian Empire]], he gave control of all Mongol forces to Muqali and gave him the title of King, a largely ceremonial title. Despite Genghis Khan having most of the main Mongol forces taken away and sent to the West, Muqali was able to subdue most of northern China with his small force of around 20,000 Mongols, although some historians give figures of between 40,000 and 70,000 men to account for his foreign auxilaries.\n\nIn 1217, Muqali attacked modern-day [[Hebei|Hebei Province]],northern [[Shandong|Shandong Province]], and northern [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi Province]], controlled by the [[Jin dynasty]]. This was an important agricultural area, which Muqali had largely subdued by 1219. In 1220, Muqali turned his attention to the rest of Shandong Province; four towns were captured, but the hard-pressed Jin forces managed to hold on elsewhere in the province. After suffering a number of devastating defeats by Muqali in the field, the Jin learned that they could only hope to resist him by holding their cities and outlasting Muqali's staying power.\n\nMuqali's last campaign began in 1222. He crossed the [[Wei River]] and attacked south, capturing towns that had already been plundered by a previous Mongol general, Samuqa. Meanwhile, the Jin forces launched a counter-attack in [[Shanxi|Shanxi Province]]. Muqali swiftly raced to the area; the Jin forces fled without giving battle. Besieging another town, Muqali became seriously ill and died shortly thereafter in 1223. On his deathbed, Muqali declared with pride that he had never been defeated.\n\nAfter his death, Genghis Khan gave command to Muqali's son, Bol. In seven years of campaigning in northern China, he had reduced the Jin dynasty's territories to only [[Henan|Henan Province]]. He had proven himself to be an excellent general who was indefatigable in his efforts to serve Genghis Khan. His extraordinary tenure was demonstrated by the inefficacy of other Mongol generals who failed to make any headway in China after his death. By the time of Ogedei's ascension in 1229, the Mongol detachments in China had suffered numerous setbacks, which led to a mini-revival of Jin fortunes until [[Subutai]] and [[Tolui]] were dispatched with the main Mongol army in 1232.\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, descendants of Mukhali served the [[Great Khan]] of the Mongols, especially those of the [[Tolui]]d lineage. A few of his descendants, such as [[Antong]] and Baiju, later became prominent officials in the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] fashion of the [[Yuan dynasty]] founded by Genghis Khan's grandson, [[Kublai Khan]].\n\nRetainers of the Toluid [[Hulagu]] participated in the conquest of [[Persia]], then called [[Mollai]], and later founded the [[Jalayirid]] Dynasty which ruled from [[Baghdad]] after the collapse of the Hulaguid [[Ilkhanate]].\n\nA statue of Muqali, together with [[Bo'orchu]], flanks the statue of Genghis Khan in [[Chinggis Square]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]].\n\n{{Generals and ministers of Genghis Khan}}\n\n== Descendant ==\n*[[Dorjeban]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1170 births]]\n[[Category:1223 deaths]]\n[[Category:13th-century monarchs in Asia]]\n[[Category:Generals of the Mongol Empire]]\n[[Category:Military strategists]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Jin dynasty\u2192Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqali"}

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.<ref name=Science>{{cite journal|title=The Aye-Ayes or Cheiromys of Madagascar|journal=Science|date=3 November 1881|volume=2|issue=75|pages=574\u2013576|doi=10.1126/science.os-2.76.574 |pmid=17791380}}</ref>\n\nThe aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain.  It has been considered a highly derived member of the family [[Indridae]], a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] branch of the [[strepsirrhine]] suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|Vilgalys|Ruvolo|1996|pp=??}}  In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder '''Chiromyiformes''', a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [[Colin Groves]] upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a [[clade]] with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs.{{Sfn|Groves|2005|p=121}}\n\nHowever, molecular results have consistently placed ''Daubentonia'' as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of [[Lemuroidea|lemurs]].<ref name=\"Del Pero1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Del Pero|first1= M.|last2= Crovella|first2= S.|last3= Cervella|first3= P.|last4= Ardito|first4= G.|last5= Rumpler|first5= Y.|title= Phylogenetic relationships among Malagasy lemurs as revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|year= 1995|pages= 431\u2013440|doi= 10.1007/BF02382865}}</ref><ref name=\"Porter1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Porter|first1= C.A.|last2= Sampaio|first2= I.|last3= Schneider|first3= H.|last4= Schneider|first4= M.P.C.|last5= Czelusniak|first5= J.|last6= Goodman|first6= M.|title= Evidence on primate phylogeny from \u03b5-globin gene sequences and flanking regions|journal= Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume= 40|issue= 1|year= 1995|pages= 30\u201355|doi= 10.1007/BF00166594}}</ref><ref name=\"Yoder1996\">{{cite journal|last1= Yoder|first1= A.D.|last2= Vilgalys|first2= R.|last3= Ruvolo|first3= M.|title= Molecular evolutionary dynamics of cytochrome b in strepsirrhine primates: the phylogenetic significance of third-position transversions |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 13|issue= 10|year= 1996|pages= 1339\u20131350|doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025580}}</ref><ref name=\"Roos2004\">{{cite journal|last1= Roos|first1= C.|last2= Schmitz|first2= J.|last3= Zischler|first3= H.|title= Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 101|issue= 29|year= 2004|pages= 10650\u201310654|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0403852101|pmid= 15249661|pmc= 489989|bibcode= 2004PNAS..10110650R}}</ref><ref name=\"Horvath2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Horvath |first1= J.E. |last2= Weisrock |first2= D.W. |last3= Embry |first3= S.L. |last4= Fiorentino |first4= I. |last5= Balhoff |first5= J.P. |last6= Kappeler |first6= P. |last7= Wray |first7= G.A. |last8= Willard |first8= H.F. |last9= Yoder |first9= A.D. |doi= 10.1101/gr.7265208 |title= Development and application of a phylogenomic toolkit: Resolving the evolutionary history of Madagascar's lemurs |journal= Genome Research |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 489\u2013499 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18245770|pmc= 2259113}}</ref><ref name=\"Orlando2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Orlando |first1= L. |last2= Calvignac |first2= S. |last3= Schnebelen |first3= C. |last4= Douady |first4= C.J. |last5= Godfrey |first5= L.R. |last6= H\u00e4nni |first6= C. |doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-8-121 |title= DNA from extinct giant lemurs links archaeolemurids to extant indriids |journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume= 8 |issue= 121 |pages= 121 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18442367|pmc= 2386821}}</ref><ref name=\"Brosius2011\">{{cite journal|last1= Brosius|first1= J.|last2= Perelman|first2= P.|last3= Johnson|first3= W.E.|last4= Roos|first4= C.|last5= Seu\u00e1nez|first5= H.N.|last6= Horvath|first6= J.E.|last7=Moreira|first7= M.A.M.|last8= Kessing|first8= B.|last9= Pontius|first9= J.|last10= Roelke|first10= M.|last11= Rumpler|first11= Y.|last12= Schneider|first12= M.P.C.|last13= Silva|first13= A.|last14= O'Brien|first14= S.J.|last15= Pecon-Slattery|first15= J.|title=A Molecular Phylogeny of Living Primates |journal= PLoS Genetics|volume= 7|issue= 3|year= 2011|pages= e1001342|doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001342}}</ref><ref name=\"Perry2012\">{{cite journal|last1= Perry|first1= G.H.|last2= Reeves|first2= D.|last3= Melsted|first3= P.|last4= Ratan|first4= A.|last5= Miller|first5= W.|last6= Michelini|first6= K.|last7= Louis|first7= E.E.|last8= Pritchard|first8= J.K.|last9= Mason|first9= C.E.|last10= Gilad|first10= Y.|title=A Genome Sequence Resource for the Aye-Aye (''Daubentonia madagascariensis''), a Nocturnal Lemur from Madagascar |journal= Genome Biology and Evolution |volume= 4|issue= 2|year= 2012|pages= 126\u2013135|doi= 10.1093/gbe/evr132}}</ref>  The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that [[Oceanic dispersal|rafted]] from Africa to Madagascar during the [[Paleogene]].<ref name=\"Roos2004\" /><ref name=Sellers>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225011846/http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13\u201317}}</ref><ref name = \"Ali&Huber\">{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = J.

Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range.

They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation.

Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it.

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.<ref name=Science>{{cite journal|title=The Aye-Ayes or Cheiromys of Madagascar|journal=Science|date=3 November 1881|volume=2|issue=75|pages=574\u2013576|doi=10.1126/science.os-2.76.574 |pmid=17791380}}</ref>\n\nThe aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain.

However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\n\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.<ref name=\"Perry2012\" /> The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees, using the hooked nail.<ref name=Science/> The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Anatomy of the hand and arm in Daubentonia madagascariensis: a functional and phylogenetic outlook|last = Soligo|first = C.|date = 2005|journal = Folia Primatol|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 262\u2013300|doi = 10.1159/000088034|pmid = 16230860|access-date = |url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88034}}</ref> The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [[pseudothumb]], to aid in gripping.<ref name= \"Hartstone\u2010Rose2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Hartstone\u2010Rose|first1= A.|last2= Dickinson|first2= E.|last3= Boettcher|first3=M.

These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [[Fresnel lens]], and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [[lesser galago]], [[bat-eared fox]], [[mouse lemur]], and others.\n\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin.\n\n== Behaviour and lifestyle ==\n[[File:Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis, Joseph Wolf.jpg|thumb|220px|An aye-aye foraging, c.1863, [[Joseph Wolf]].]]\n[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Copenhagen (Left Hand).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Closeup of the hand showing the elongated digits and the thinner third digit.]]\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers.<ref name=Haring>{{cite journal|last=Haring|first=David|title=Eep! It's an Aye-Aye.|journal=Wildlife Conservation|date=March 1996|pages=28\u201335}}</ref> The aye-aye begins [[foraging]] between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} a night.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dodo: Journal of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Volume 30|last=|first=|publisher=Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust|year=1994|isbn=0-9515581-7-X|location=Jersey, Channel Islands|pages=43}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gnawed limb, Daubentonia madagascariensis.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Gnawed limb by an Aye-Aye to prey on larvae]]\nThough foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Patterns of Range Use and Social Organization in Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) on Nosy Mangabe|last = Sterling|first = Eleanor|date = 1993|journal = Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis|pages = 1\u201310|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4899-2412-4_1|pmid = |editor-last = Kappeler|location = Plenum Press, New York|isbn = 978-1-4899-2414-8}}</ref> Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.{{r|Durrell}}\n\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine individuals were transported to [[Nosy Mangabe]], an island near [[Maroantsetra]] off eastern Madagascar, in 1966.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=605\u2013606}} Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] in 2014.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=CITES>{{cite web | url = http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Daubentonia | title = Checklist of CITES Species | website = CITES | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | accessdate = 18 March 2015}}</ref> This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops and for poaching.

Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [[Sakalava]] people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's [[aorta]].{{r|2007Piper}}\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n[[File:Aye Aye.JPG|270px|thumb|upright|At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in Durham, North Carolina]]\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy.

In the 1990s, [[Steinway Street]] between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard saw the establishment of many Arabic shops, restaurants, and cafes, which is unofficially called \"Little Egypt\", due to the number of Arabs residing there and the mostly Egyptian shops and lounges there.\n\n[[Croatians]] from [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] have been numerous since the 1960s and their numbers continue to grow.

The neighborhood was part of [[Long Island City]] prior to the latter's incorporation into the [[City of Greater New York]] in 1898.\n\nThe area south of Astoria was called Ravenswood, and traditionally, [[Broadway (Queens)|Broadway]] was considered the border between the two. Today, however, many residents and businesses south of Broadway identify themselves as Astorians for convenience or status, since Long Island City has historically been considered an [[Industrial district|industrial area]], and Ravenswood is now mostly a low-income neighborhood. Some of the thoroughfares have lent their names to unofficial terms for the areas they serve. For instance, the eastern end of Astoria, with Steinway Street as its main thoroughfare, is sometimes referred to simply as \"Steinway\", and the northern end around Ditmars Boulevard is sometimes referred to as \"Ditmars\", with their convergence point bearing the neighborhood name \"Ditmars-Steinway\".<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Jones |first=Delmos J. |authorlink= |author2=Joan Turner |author3=Joan Montbach |date=December 1992 |title=Declining Social Services and the Threat to Social Reproduction: An Urban Dilemma |journal=City & Society |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=99\u2013114 |doi=10.1525/city.1992.6.2.99 |id= |url= |format= |accessdate=}}</ref> Banners displayed on lamp posts along 30th Avenue refer to it as \"the Heart of Astoria\".<ref>O'Donnell, Michelle.

In 1879, the Long Island Terra Cotta Company was established in Ravenswood, by Rudolph Franke. By 1900, Ravenswood was heavily commercial, and remains so to this day. However, the name has retained its residential character through the [[New York City Housing Authority]] project that was built in 1949 to 1951 with this name between 34th and 36th Avenues, and 12th and 24th Streets.\n\nThe name also identifies the large electric power station established along the shore of the East River, just south of the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]]. The [[Ravenswood Generating Station]] which includes Ravenswood No.&nbsp;3 or \"[[Big Allis]]\", was built by [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]] in 1963-65 but, due to deregulation, has subsequently been owned by [[KeySpan]], National Grid, and [[TransCanada Corp.|TransCanada]].
