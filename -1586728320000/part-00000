The Americans won their first gold medals in the sport since 1904, winning championships in three of the five diving events in 1920. The team swept both the men's and women's springboard events (though only Americans competed in the women's springboard), and added a gold and a bronze in the men's platform.

The Americans took eight of the ten gold medals, along with five silvers and three bronzes. This gave the team more than half of the available medals\u201416 out of 30; more than three times the next-best country. Eleven different Americans finished with at least one medal. The United States set five new world records and tied another.\n\nKahanamoku set a new Olympic record in the quarterfinals of the 100 free, then tied the world record twice in the semis and the final as the Americans swept the medals in that event. Ross took a pair of gold medals in the other two freestyle events. Kegeris briefly took the Olympic record in the 100 metre backstroke semifinals before Warren Kealoha broke the world record in the second semifinal; Kealoha took gold and Kegeris silver in the final. The relay team also set a world record in winning the gold medal.\n\nSchroth, like Kegeris, briefly held an Olympic record in the 100 free before Bleibtrey broke the world record in a later semifinal. Bleibtrey bettered her own new record, leading the American women to a sweep of the medals in that event. Bleibtrey took her second world record and second gold medal in the 300 free, as the Americans swept that event as well. Her third gold medal and third world record came as part of the 4x100 free relay team along with Schroth, Guest, and Woodbridge.\n\n<small>''Ranks given are within the heat.''</small>\n\n;

In the bronze medal match, however, the team was shut out by Sweden.\n\n; Quarterfinals\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|USA|1912}}\n| score1= 7\n| team2= {{wp|GRE|old}}\n| score2= 0\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Semifinals\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|GBR}}\n| score1= 7\n| team2= {{wp|USA|1912}}\n| score2= 2\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Silver medal semifinals\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|USA|1912}}\n| score1= 5\n| team2= {{wp|ESP|1785}}\n| score2= 0\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Silver medal match\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|USA|1912}}\n| score1= 2\n| team2= {{wp|BEL}}\n| score2= 7\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Bronze medal semifinals\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|USA|1912}}\n| score1= &nbsp;\n| team2= {{wp|GRE|old}}\n| score2= &nbsp;\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Bronze medal match\n{{waterpolobox\n| date= \n| team1= {{wp-rt|SWE}}\n| score1= 5\n| team2= {{wp|USA|1912}}\n| score2= 0\n| location= [[Antwerp]]\n| goals1= \n| goals2= \n}}\n\n; Final rank: 4th\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|Athletics at the 1920 Summer Olympics}}\n\n90 athletes represented the United States in 1920. It was the sixth appearance of the nation in athletics, a sport in which the United States had competed at every Games. The American team, used to dominance of the sport, was seriously challenged for the first time. The nine gold medals won by the team tied the mark for fewest the nation had ever won, matching the 1896 total (when only 12 events, rather than 29, were contested). Finland matched the United States gold medal for gold medal, the first time any other nation had done so and the last time until the 1972 Games. The depth of the American team allowed the team to collect twelve silver and eight bronze medals as well (the United States's 29 total medals nearly doubled the 16 of Finland), allowing the team to remain on top of the athletics medals leader board yet again.\n\n<small>''Ranks given are within the heat.''</small>\n\n{|class=wikitable

It was the nation's fourth appearance in the sport; the United States was the only nation to have competed at each Olympic diving contest to that point. The Americans won their first gold medals in the sport since 1904, winning championships in three of the five diving events in 1920. The team swept both the men's and women's springboard events (though only Americans competed in the women's springboard), and added a gold and a bronze in the men's platform. Pinkston was the only diver from any nation in 1920 to win multiple medals.\n\n; Men\n\n<small>''Ranks given are within the semifinal group.''</small>\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Diver\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=3|Semifinals\n!colspan=3|Final\n|-\n!Points\n!Score\n!Rank\n!Points\n!Score\n!Rank\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Louis Balbach]]'''\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3 metre springboard|3 m springboard]]\n|align=center| 8\n|align=center| 630.80\n|align=center| 2 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 15\n|align=center| 649.50\n|align=center| {{bronze3}}\n|-\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 10 metre platform|10 m platform]]\n|align=center| 17\n|align=center| 409.15\n|align=center| 3 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 28\n|align=center| 424.00\n|align=center| 6\n|-\n| [[Richard Beauchamp (diver)|Richard Beauchamp]]\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's plain high diving|Plain high dive]]\n|align=center| 23\n|align=center| 135.0\n|align=center| 6\n|align=center colspan=3| Did not advance\n|-\n| '''[[Louis Kuehn]]'''\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3 metre springboard|3 m springboard]]\n|align=center| 7\n|align=center| 628.15\n|align=center| 1 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 10\n|align=center| 675.40\n|align=center| {{gold1}}\n|-\n| [[Frank Mullen (diver)|Frank Mullen]]\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's plain high diving|Plain high dive]]\n|align=center| 27\n|align=center| 144.0\n|align=center| 6\n|align=center colspan=3| Did not advance\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Clarence Pinkston]]'''\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3 metre springboard|3 m springboard]]\n|align=center| 8\n|align=center| 622.70\n|align=center| 2 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 11\n|align=center| 655.30\n|align=center| {{silver2}}\n|-\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 10 metre platform|10 m platform]]\n|align=center| 10\n|align=center| 443.00\n|align=center| 2 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 7\n|align=center| 503.30\n|align=center| {{gold1}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Harry Prieste]]'''\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 10 metre platform|10 m platform]]\n|align=center| 17\n|align=center| 441.80\n|align=center| 3 '''Q'''\n|align=center| 16\n|align=center| 468.65\n|align=center| {{bronze3}}\n|-\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's plain high diving|Plain high dive]]\n|align=center| 18\n|align=center| 149.5\n|align=center| 4\n|align=center colspan=3| Did not advance\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[Clyde Swendsen]]\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 10 metre platform|10 m platform]]\n|align=center| 26\n|align=center| 414.80\n|align=center| 6\n|align=center colspan=3| Did not advance\n|-\n| [[Diving at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's plain high diving|Plain high dive]]\n|align=center| 25\n|align=center| 148.0\n|align=center| 5\n|align=center colspan=3| Did not advance\n|}\n\n;

It was the nation's sixth appearance in the sport; the United States was the only nation to have competed in every Olympic swimming edition to that point. The Americans took eight of the ten gold medals, along with five silvers and three bronzes. This gave the team more than half of the available medals\u201416 out of 30; more than three times the next-best country. Eleven different Americans finished with at least one medal. The United States set five new world records and tied another.\n\nKahanamoku set a new Olympic record in the quarterfinals of the 100 free, then tied the world record twice in the semis and the final as the Americans swept the medals in that event. Ross took a pair of gold medals in the other two freestyle events. Kegeris briefly took the Olympic record in the 100 metre backstroke semifinals before Warren Kealoha broke the world record in the second semifinal; Kealoha took gold and Kegeris silver in the final. The relay team also set a world record in winning the gold medal.\n\nSchroth, like Kegeris, briefly held an Olympic record in the 100 free before Bleibtrey broke the world record in a later semifinal. Bleibtrey bettered her own new record, leading the American women to a sweep of the medals in that event. Bleibtrey took her second world record and second gold medal in the 300 free, as the Americans swept that event as well. Her third gold medal and third world record came as part of the 4x100 free relay team along with Schroth, Guest, and Woodbridge.\n\n<small>''Ranks given are within the heat.''</small>\n\n;

The American team, used to dominance of the sport, was seriously challenged for the first time. The nine gold medals won by the team tied the mark for fewest the nation had ever won, matching the 1896 total (when only 12 events, rather than 29, were contested). Finland matched the United States gold medal for gold medal, the first time any other nation had done so and the last time until the 1972 Games. The depth of the American team allowed the team to collect twelve silver and eight bronze medals as well (the United States's 29 total medals nearly doubled the 16 of Finland), allowing the team to

In a somewhat unusual result, all three of the American dressage competitors earned exactly the same score.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Equestrian\n!rowspan=2|Horse\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-\n!

They repeated this performance in the trap and team clay pigeons events.\n\nThe American shooters won both the individual and team golds in the free rifle.\n\nThe team took both team pistol golds, as well as one of two individual pistol golds.\n\nThe military rifle events gave the United States more trouble; the team won no medal in the individual 300 metre prone event, and took only silver in the team 300 metre standing competition.\n\nThe running deer was by far the worst category for the Americans; of the four events, the United States took only a single bronze medal in the team single shots event.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Shooter\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-\n| [[Harry Adams (sport shooter)|Harry Adams]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre military rifle, prone|300 m military rifle, prone]]\n|align=center| 57\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| '''[[Mark Arie]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's trap|Trap]]\n|align=center| 95\n|align=center| {{gold1}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[Howard Bayles]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre military pistol|30 m military pistol]]\n|align=center| 244\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre free pistol|50 m free pistol]]\n|align=center| 430\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Horace Bonser]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's trap|Trap]]\n|align=center| 87\n|align=center| 5\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Raymond Bracken]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre military pistol|30 m military pistol]]\n|align=center| 272\n|align=center| {{silver2}}\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre free pistol|50 m free pistol]]\n|align=center| 456\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[Thomas Brown (sport shooter)|Thomas Brown]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre running deer, single shots|100 m deer, single shots]]\n|align=center| 33\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre running deer, double shots|100 m deer, double shots]]\n|align=center| 63\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Dennis Fenton]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre small-bore rifle|50 m small-bore rifle]]\n|align=center| 385\n|align=center| {{bronze3}}\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre free rifle, three positions|300 m free rifle, 3 pos.]]\n|align=center| 960\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| '''[[Morris Fisher]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre free rifle, three positions|300 m free rifle, 3 pos.]]\n|align=center| 996\n|align=center| {{gold1}}\n|-\n| [[George Fiske (sport shooter)|George Fiske]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre free pistol|50 m free pistol]]\n|align=center| 458\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Karl Frederick]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre military pistol|30 m military pistol]]\n|align=center| 262\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre free pistol|50 m free pistol]]\n|align=center| 496\n|align=center| {{gold1}}\n|-\n| [[Louis Harant]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre military pistol|30 m military pistol]]\n|align=center| 264\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Frederick Hird]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre military rifle, prone|300 m military rifle, prone]]\n|align=center| 55\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=4| [[Joseph Jackson (sport shooter)|Joseph Jackson]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre military rifle, prone|300 m military rifle, prone]]\n|align=center| 54\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 600 metre military rifle, prone|600 m military rifle, prone]]\n|align=center| 58\n|align=center| 5\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre running deer, single shots|100 m deer, single shots]]\n|align=center| 30\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre running deer, double shots|100 m deer, double shots]]\n|align=center| 61\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=2| '''[[Alfred Lane]]'''\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre military pistol|30 m military pistol]]\n|align=center| 258\n|align=center| Unknown\n|-\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre free pistol|50 m free pistol]]\n|align=center| 481\n|align=center| {{bronze3}}\n|-\n| [[Joseph Lawless (sport shooter)|Joseph Lawless]]\n| [[Shooting at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 600 metre military rifle, prone|600 m military rifle, prone]]\n|align=center| 57\n|align=center| 8\n|-\n|rowspan=7| [[Willis A.

On the spot [[Sariputta]] (Skt: \u015a\u0101riputra) attained [[Sot\u0101panna|the first Path]] (Sot\u0101patti) and later told them to his friend [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]] (Skt: Maudgalyayana) who also attained.

It has been used at [[Sarnath]], Tirhut, Kanari Copperplate, Tagoung, Sherghatti, near Gaya, Allahabad column, [[Sanchi]] etc.\n\n==On Buddha images==\nThe mantra was often also carved below the images of the Buddha.

Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as [[Wildcat cartridge|wildcats]]. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game or change external or terminal ballistic behavior.

There are five free tetrominoes:\n{{multiple image \n| align=left\n| image_style = border:none;\n| image_gap = 25\n| image1 = Tetromino I.svg\n| width1=71\n| caption1 = I <br>\"straight polyomino\"\n| image2=Tetromino O.svg\n| width2=39\n| caption2=O <br>\"square polyomino\"\n| image3=Tetromino T.svg\n| width3=54\n| caption3=T <br>\"T-polyomino\"\n| image4=Tetromino L.svg\n| width4=56\n| caption4=L <br>\"L-polyomino\"\n| image5=Tetromino S.svg\n| width5=56\n| caption5=S <br>\"skew polyomino\"\n}}\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n=== One-sided tetrominoes ===\nOne-sided tetrominoes are tetrominoes that may be translated and rotated but not reflected. They are used by, and are overwhelmingly associated with, the game ''Tetris''. There are seven distinct one-sided tetrominoes. These tetrominoes are names by the letter of the alphabet they most closely resemble. The \"I\", \"O\", and \"T\" tetrominoes have reflectional symmetry, so it does not matter whether they are considered as free tetrominoes or one-sided tetrominoes. The remaining four tetrominoes, \"J\", \"L\", \"S\", and \"Z\", exhibit a phenomenon called [[chirality (mathematics)|chirality]]. J and L are reflections of each other, and S and Z are reflections of each other.\n\nAs free tetrominoes, J is equivalent to L, and S is equivalent to Z. But in two dimensions and without reflections, it is not possible to transform J into L or S into Z.\n\n{{multiple image \n| align=left\n| image_style = border:none;\n| image_gap = 25\n| image1 = Tetromino I.svg\n| width1=71\n| caption1 = I <br>\"straight polyomino\"\n| image2=Tetromino O.svg\n| width2=39\n| caption2=O <br>\"square polyomino\"\n| image3=Tetromino T.svg\n| width3=54\n| caption3=T <br>\"T-polyomino\"\n| image4=Tetromino J.svg\n| width4=54\n| caption4=J <br>\"L-polyomino\"\n| image5=Tetromino L.svg\n| width5=56\n| caption5=L <br>\"L-polyomino\"\n| image6=Tetromino S.svg\n| width6=56\n| caption6=S <br>\"skew polyomino\"\n| image7=Tetromino Z.svg\n| width7=53\n| caption7=Z <br>\"skew polyomino\"\n}}\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n===Fixed tetrominoes===\nThe fixed tetrominoes allow only translation, not rotation or reflection.

A member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries, the character was created by writer [[Edmond Hamilton]] and artist [[John Forte]], and first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #317.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Dream Girl | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 111  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Original version===\nNura's home planet is [[Naltor]], where virtually all the inhabitants possess [[precognition|precognitive]] abilities. After foreseeing the deaths of several Legionnaires, she crafted an elaborate plan to save their lives. As part of that plan, she used Naltorian science \u2014 of which she was an expert \u2014 to change the powers of [[Ayla Ranzz]] from lightning casting to the ability to make objects super lightweight. For many years thereafter, Ayla \u2014 who had been known as Lightning Lass \u2014 became Light Lass.\n\nThe Legionnaires she foresaw dying were actually robot doubles. Having joined the team under false pretenses, she left the Legion temporarily and became a member of the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]]. There she was reunited with [[Thom Kallor|Star Boy]], with whom she had become romantically involved. Star Boy had previously been expelled from the Legion for the self-defense killing of Nura's former love, Naltorian Kenz Nahor, who had tried to kill Star Boy over jealousy of his relationship with Nura.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nYears later, Dream Girl served as Legion leader (only the second female Legionnaire to do so), with her first mission being perhaps the Legion's greatest challenge: defending the [[United Planets]] from an assault by the ancient villain [[Darkseid]]. Her sister Mysa, the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]], also served as a Legionnaire. Her mother Kiwa Nal was the High Seer of Naltor (Naltor's leader); the identity of her father was unrevealed.\n\nDream Girl's mastery of Naltorian science placed her in an elite group. Among the Legionnaires, her scientific prowess was surpassed only by [[Brainiac 5]] and the original [[Invisible Kid]], and perhaps equaled only by [[Mon-El]]. Additionally, she compensated for the non-physical nature of her powers by engaging in numerous training sessions with [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]. Eventually, no Legionnaire was more skilled in nonpowered hand-to-hand combat except Karate Kid himself and Timber Wolf.\n\n===Reboot version===\nAfter the events of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' mini-series, the Legion's continuity was completely rebooted. The second version of Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first [[precognition|precognitive]] to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-''Zero Hour'' Legion stories.\n\nFor most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still [[Thom Kallor|Star Boy]]'s girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from [[narcolepsy]], falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of Mysa, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename '''Dreamer''', shortly before the Legion's continuity was rebooted again in 2005.\n\n===2005 reboot===\nIn the 2005 reboot, her codename returned to Dream Girl. In this continuity, she sometimes loses track of events in the present when tracking a future event (she once failed to get involved in a fight because she thought it had already happened).\n\nBrainiac 5 was initially shown as resenting her ability to simply \"know\" things that he had to deduce, and he once questions her abilities. Her response is a prediction that they would be married.{{Issue|date=March 2009}}\n\nShe later appears to have been killed in battle; however, Brainiac 5 places her body in stasis and works to revive her. Although he fails to fully resurrect her, she becomes a spirit with the ability to appear to anyone in their dreams or daydreams.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAt first dismissed as a delusion in the mind of the grieving Brainiac 5 (he even claims that her \"Nura\" may be a facet of his intuitive subconscious, appearing to him while daydreaming in a form suited to appease his tastes<ref name=\"issue47\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]|penciller=[[Rick Leonardi|Leonardi, Rick]]|inker=[[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]|story=Dream Wedding, Blind Love|title=Legion of Super-Heroes|volume=5|issue=47|date=December 2008|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>), Nura's presence in Brainiac 5 mind becomes a well-known fact, worrying [[Princess Projectra]], who, in a bid to destroy the Legion for their inability to save [[Orando]], fears Nura's precognitive sight. When Brainiac 5 has a female spirit medium [[Mediumship#Channeling|channel]] Nura's mind enough to share some physical intimacy, Projectra uses her powers on the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] to have the inhibitions and urges in Brainiac 5's mind viciously attack Nura when she returns to his body. Despite Querl's valiant effort to control them, the urges gouge out Nura's eyes, blinding her at a spiritual level, stripping the girl of both her physical and precognitive sight, a fate to which she is quietly resigned, as long as she can still be with her lover.<ref name=\"issue47\"/> Nura is later revived by Brainiac 5 by transferring her consciousness back in a renewed, cloned version of her original body, restoring her powers and sight.

[[Dream Boy (comics)|Dream Boy]].\n\n===Post-Infinite Crisis===\nThe events of the  2005\u20132006 \"[[Infinite Crisis]]\" storyline apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion continuity, as seen in \"[[The Lightning Saga]]\" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the \"[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]\" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''. Dream Girl is included in their number. In this incarnation, her powers are implied to be linked to the realm of [[Dreaming (comics)|the Dreaming]], ruled by [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of [[Endless (comics)|the Endless]]. It is later revealed that Dream Girl somehow passed on her prophetic knowledge to Thom Kallor.{{Issue|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn \"The Lightning Saga\" storyline, Dream Girl was one of the Legionnaires sent to the 21st Century to capture the essence of [[Bart Allen]] in a lightning rod before his death. She was found within [[Arkham Asylum]] as a prisoner of [[Dr. Destiny]], who used her powers as his new \"dreamstone\".\n\nDream Girl is among the missing Legion members as of the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" storyline. In that story and in the subsequent ''[[Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' miniseries, it is revealed that Dream Girl had prophetic visions of [[Superboy-Prime]] as the harbinger of a \"Crisis of the 31st Century\", which prompted Brainiac 5 to concoct the contingency plan to defeat Prime, including the resurrection of Bart Allen.\n\nDream Girl last appeared in a preview in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (vol. 2) #1, seemingly back in the 21st Century and imprisoned in a device.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all natives of Naltor, Nura has the power to see the future and experience visions in dreams; she is rated one of the most powerful precognitives on the planet. Her hand-to-hand fighting skills\u2014having trained with [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]\u2014combined with her ability to glimpse seconds into the future, made her a formidable short-term opponent in battle, capable of taking on [[Persuader (comics)|The Persuader]], but the sheer number of expanding possible futures in each second of a battle made it difficult for her to keep the advantage. Her precognitive abilities also give her an edge in strategic planning.\n\nNura is a skilled scientist, specializing in biology; when Brainiac 5 quits the Legion after being acquitted of murdering the [[Infinite Man]], team leader [[Polar Boy]] asks her to consider becoming the Legion's chief scientist. She is highly charismatic, capable of convincing men and women to do what she wants, and guided the Legion as leader through Darkseid's awakening in the Legion's time.\n\n===Equipment===\nAs a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] she is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. On at least one occasion, she was able to exert her extraordinary willpower to extend the Legion flight ring's anti-grav power to other objects, as if using telekinesis.\n==Other versions==\nNura Nal is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n==In other media==\n* In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Dream Girl made a cameo appearance in the episode \"New Kids in Town.\"\n* Dream Girl is featured in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Tara Platt]].
