'\"Enga Mama'' was a Tamil remake of the Hindi film ''Brahmachari'' produced by [[G. P. Sippy]] and performed moderately at the box-office.\n\n==Films in Hindi==\nFrom the initial phase of his career, AVM was associated with a number of producers and directors from North India. His 1938 film ''Nandakumar'' was the Tamil remake of a Marathi film. His 1940 film ''[[Bhookailas (1940 film)|Bhookailas]]'' was directed by Sundar Rao Nadkarni who had received his training in Bombay.\n\nIn 1951, AVM made his entry into the Hindi film industry with ''[[Bahar (film)|Bahar]]''.

Apart from being AVM's first film in Hindi, it also marked the launch of [[Vyjayanthimala]] in the Hindi film industry. In 1954, he made ''[[Ladki]]'', his second film in Hindi, with [[Vyjayanthimala]] again in the lead. Both these films were directed by M. V. Raman.\n\nAfter enjoying moderate successes in his first two films in Hindi which went unnoticed, AVM ascended the heights of Bollywood with the third one ''Hum Panchi Ek Daal Ke''(1957). It was a children's film based on the theme of national integration and won him the prime minister's gold medal.<ref name=\"centenary_bio\" />\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of ''Hum Panchi Ek Dal Ke'', AVM produced some good films like ''Bhai Bhai''(1956), which was popular for the song ''Mera Naam Abdul Rehman'' sung by [[Kishore Kumar]]<ref name=\"music_india\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicindiaonline.com/music/hindi_bollywood/s/producer.167/ |title=AVM |accessdate=10 May 2008 |publisher=musicindiaonline.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521213315/http://www.musicindiaonline.com/music/hindi_bollywood/s/producer.167/ |archivedate=21 May 2008  }}</ref> and ''Miss Mary''(1957), the dubbed version of the Tamil film ''Missiamma''.<ref name=\"Deccan_Herald\">{{cite news|title=No more Tamil films, says AVM Studios |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/july292004/n2.asp |work=Deccan Herald |accessdate=10 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520215100/http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/july292004/n2.asp |archivedate=20 May 2011  }}</ref> ''[[Bhabhi (1957 film)|Bhabhi]]'' (1957) featured [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Pandari Bai]] and [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]], apart from comedian [[Jagdeep]] in his first romantic role.<ref name=\"rediff\">{{cite news | last=Srinivasan | first= V.S. | title= Meet Soorma Bhopali | date= 14 July 1998| url =http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1998/jul/14jag.htm | work =rediff.com | accessdate = 10 May 2008}}</ref> Jagdeep also acted in other films produced by AVM as ''Hum Panchi Ek Dal Ke'' and ''Barkha''.<ref name=\"rediff\" />\n\nThe Hindi films ''Miss Mary'', ''Bhakti Mahima'' and ''Bhakt Prahlad'' were dubbed versions of AVM's Tamil or Telugu hits.\n\nThe 1961 film ''Chhaya'' won [[Nirupa Roy]] the Filmfare Award for the Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<ref name=\"chaya_filmfare\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodsoundtracks.com/html/filmfareawardbestsupportingactress.htm |title=Filmfare Award Best Supporting Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Complete Winners List |accessdate=10 May 2008 |publisher=bollywoordsoundtracks.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510085336/http://www.bollywoodsoundtracks.com/html/filmfareawardbestsupportingactress.htm |archivedate=10 May 2008  }}</ref> Other notable Hindi films made by AVM during the 1960s were ''Man Mauji'', ''Main Chup Rahungi'', ''Pooja Ke Phool'' and ''Mehrban''.\n\nAVM's last Hindi film was ''Jaise Ko Taisa'' directed by Krishnan-Panju in 1973.\n\n==Family==\nThe Family Of AV.

Moreover, the AVM family chose to focus their attention upon social activities other than filming. AVM Productions produced not more than four films during the decade: ''Bomma Borusa'', ''Dil Ka Raja'',''Akka Thamudu'' and ''Jaise Ko Taisa''. ''Bomma Borusa'' made in  Telugu by [[K.

''Akka Thamudu'' directed by the successful partnership of Krishnan-Panju was AVM's last film in Telugu. It was also AVM's only Telugu film featuring [[Jayalalithaa Jayaram|Jayalalithaa]]. In 1973, AVM produced his last film ''Jaise Ko Taisa'' starring Jitendra in the lead role.\n\nAVM did not produce any movies following ''Jaise Ko Taisa'' in 1973.

The charitable activities of the AVM group were channelled through an organisation called AVM Charities established at [[Mylapore]] in Chennai.

On 10 June 1963, AVM inaugurated Avichi High School in [[Virugambakkam]] in memory of his father Avichi Chettiar. The motive behind the founding was to provide good quality education to the poorer sections of society. Later, Avichi High School was upgraded to Avichi Higher Secondary School. A number of schools have been established since the creation of ''Avichi School''. In 1994, AVM's son Kumaran established the ''Avichi High School for girls''. This was followed by the establishment of AVM Rajeswari Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Virugambakkam in 1995. These schools which are run by the AVM Group as a part of AVM Charities are regarded as some of the best in Chennai.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===As producer===\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#cccccf; text-align:center;\"\n| '''Year''' || '''Film''' || '''Language''' || '''Cast''' || '''Director'''\n|-\n| 1935 || ''Alli arjuna'' || Tamil|| ||\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[AVM Productions]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Enatu Valkkai Anuppavangal'' (English: My Experiences in Life), Autobiography by A.

It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin.

Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany (1968)|second constitution]] in 1968.

It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles.

Instead the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]]'s role in the [[German Peasants' War]] and the role played by the heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization.\n\nEspecially after the Ninth Party Congress in 1976, East Germany upheld historical reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] as examples and role models.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Volkspolizei at the official opening of the Brandenburg Gate.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Police cadets of the East German [[Volkspolizei]] waiting for the official opening of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] on 22 December 1989]]\n\n===''Die Wende'' (German Reunification)===\n{{Main|Die Wende|German reunification}}\n\nIn May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local government elections, many citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s border with [[Austria]] on 2 May. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter the country via [[Czechoslovakia]], and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary into Austria and West Germany beyond.<ref name=\"Judt\" /> By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary,<ref>[https://archive.is/20050419213613/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_east_wall.shtml The Berlin Wall (1961\u201389)] German Notes. Retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref> most of whom did not attempt the risky crossing into Austria but remained instead in Hungary or claimed asylum in West German embassies in [[Prague]] or [[Budapest]]. The major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September, when the Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Horn]] announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria, with tens of thousands following in the coming weeks.<ref name=\"Judt\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 612 }}</ref>\n\nMany others [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|demonstrated against the ruling party]], especially in the city of [[Leipzig]]. The Leipzig demonstrations became a weekly occurrence, showing a turnout of 10,000 people at the first demonstration on 2 October and peaking at an estimated 300,000 by the end of the month.<ref name=\"Postwar 613\" /> The protests were surpassed in East Berlin, where half a million demonstrators turned out against the regime on 4 November.<ref name=\"Postwar 613\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first  = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 613 }}</ref> [[Kurt Masur]], the conductor of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall.<ref>Darnton, Robert, ''Berlin Journal'' (New York, 1992, W.W.

To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a concessionary law loosening restrictions on travel. When this was rejected in the ''Volkskammer'' on 5 November, the Cabinet and the [[Politburo]] of the GDR resigned.<ref name=\"Postwar 614\" /> It left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED, that of completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.\n\nOn 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a month later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, [[Neues Forum]], to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. This was approved in the ''Volkskammer'' on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 615 }}</ref>\n\nEast Germany held [[East German general election, 1990|its last elections in March 1990]]. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the \"Ostmark\" was abolished, and the Western German \"Deutsche Mark\" became common currency.\n\nAlthough the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P. |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\n\nThe great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the resulting [[deindustrialization]] in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient [[command economy]]. But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler{{snd}}see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich. Alternative Programme f\u00fcr das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46.

Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20</ref> These included: 1949\u201361, which saw the building of socialism; 1961\u20131970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u201385 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u201389 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Further|Constitution of East Germany}}\n\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nThe Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.\n* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Berlin, Palast der Republik -- um 1990 -- 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palast der Republik]], the seat of the [[Volkskammer]]]]\n[[File:Berlin DDR.jpg|thumb|Poster with the inscription \"Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR\", 1967]]\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|22|02|00|N|81|24|00|W|}}\n|  zoom =   10\n| width =  217\n| height = 250\n| caption = [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island]] was gifted to East Germany in 1972 by Cuba as an act of fraternity, although the resulting status of the island is now unclear.<ref>{{cite web|website=Deutsche Welle (DW)|url=http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|title=Castro's Caribbean island gift to East Germany|date=27 November 2016|author=Nik Martin|access-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320053848/http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n| minimap = file\n| mini-file = LocationCuba.svg\n| mini-width = 100\n| mini-height = 50\n| minipog-x = 56\n| minipog-y = 17\n| scalemark = 105\n| mark-coord =       {{coord|22.033333|-81.4}}\n|      label =       Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island\n| label-color=       black\n|  label-pos =       top\n| mark-title =       Ernst Th\u00e4llman Island\n}}\n\nThe member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\n\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.\n\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarit\u00e4t''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke''). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.<ref>Mary Elise Sarotte, ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe'' (Second Edition) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|right|A woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in East Germany in 1984.

Verwaltungsbezirke farbig.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Districts of the German Democratic Republic in 1952]]\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of East Germany|List of leaders of administrative divisions of East Germany}}\n\nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, [[East Berlin]] (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]], their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''L\u00e4nder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). The western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\n\nThe [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) and ''de facto'' disestablished the five ''L\u00e4nder''. The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982. Built in 1972, it was once part of the [[University of Leipzig|Karl-Marx-University]] and is Leipzig's tallest building.]]\n\n== Military ==\n[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|right|upright|East German ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' changing-of-the-guard ceremony in East Berlin]]\nThe government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:en:Construction soldier|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |page=184 |title=Moscow's Third World Strategy |isbn=0691023328 |last1=Rubinstein |first1=Alvin Z. |date=16 July 1990 |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201040239/https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |archive-date=1 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===East Germany and the Middle East conflict===\nEast Germany pursued an [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] policy; [[Jeffrey Herf]] argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Herf\">{{cite book |last=Herf |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Herf|year=2016 |title=Undeclared Wars with Israel: East Germany and the West German Far Left, 1967\u20131989 |url= |location= |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9781107089860 }}</ref> According to Herf, \"the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc\u2019s antagonism toward Israel.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herf |first1=Jeffrey |author-link1=Jeffrey Herf|year=2014 |title='At War with Israel': East Germany's Key Role in Soviet Policy in the Middle East |url= |journal=[[Journal of Cold War Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages= 129\u2013163 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00450}}</ref> While East Germany saw itself as an \"anti-fascist state\", it regarded [[Israel]] as a \"fascist state\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Laqueur |first=Walter |year= 1968 |title= The Road to Jerusalem: The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967 |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=Macmillan |page= [https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu/page/215 215] |isbn= 978-0025683600 |author-link=Walter Laqueur}}</ref> and East Germany strongly supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in its armed struggle against Israel.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made East German economy the richest in all of the [[Soviet Bloc]] until reunification in 1990.<ref name=\"Econ stats\">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109185421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 November 2007|title=Business America.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R.

In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian [[Paul Tillich]] claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the Communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them.<ref>Paul Tillich. Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 20.</ref> By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\n\n===State atheism===\n{{Further|State atheism|Irreligion in Germany}}\n\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, \"The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR\"</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n{{Main|de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|l1=Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]\n\nEast Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the [[Nazism|Nazi-oriented]] [[German Christians]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[united and uniting churches|United churches]] from most parts of Germany came together as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (''Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach'').\n\nIn 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and [[East Berlin]]{{NoteTag|The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church of Silesia|Evangelical Church of the G\u00f6rlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, G\u00f6rlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).}} broke away from the EKD and formed the ''Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic'' ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''. In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, \"Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen in der DDR am Anfang der f\u00fcnfziger Jahre,\" [\"Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s\"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift f\u00fcr Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;152\u2013165.</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\">Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]]. The [[Moravian Church]] also had its presence as the ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''.

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\"/>\n\nAfter 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bernd Schaefer|title= The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year= 2010|publisher= Berghahn Books|isbn= 9781845458522|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062014/https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|archive-date= 3 June 2016|url-status= live}} ch 1</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nWith a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.<ref>{{cite book|author= Adrian Webb|title= Routledge Companion to Central and Eastern Europe since 1919|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|year= 2008|publisher= Taylor & Francis|page= 185|isbn= 9780203928172|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427110838/https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|archive-date= 27 April 2016|url-status= live}}</ref>{{qn|date=September 2015}}\n\nList of apostolic administrators:\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Erfurt|Erfurt-Meiningen]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of G\u00f6rlitz|G\u00f6rlitz]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]\n* [[Apostolic administration of Schwerin|Schwerin]]\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of East Germany}}\n\n{{More citations needed section|date = June 2015}}\n\nEast Germany's culture was strongly influenced by communist thought and was marked by an attempt to define itself in opposition to the west, particularly West Germany and the United States.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The GDR dissolved itself, and Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]] on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state in the Federal Republic of Germany. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader [[Egon Krenz]], were prosecuted after reunification for crimes committed during the Cold War.\n\nGeographically, the German Democratic Republic bordered the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north; [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to the east; [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] to the southeast and [[West Germany]] to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany|Allied-occupied Berlin]], known as [[East Berlin]], which was also administered as the state's ''de facto'' capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nThe official name was ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated to ''DDR'' (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany (1968)|second constitution]] in 1968. West Germans, the western media and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like ''Ostzone'' (Eastern Zone),<ref name=zeit49>{{cite news |author=Berlin Korrespondent|title=Nationale Front in der Ostzone|url=http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |date = June 1949|access-date=10 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023236/http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone; often abbreviated to ''SBZ''), and ''sogenannte DDR''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |title=Vom Sogenannten |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203124606/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |archivedate=3 February 2016 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=21 October 1968 |page=65 |url-status=live }}</ref> (or \"so-called GDR\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |title=Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany, 1959 - Germany (West) |page=20 |year=1959 |access-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221170436/https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |archive-date=21 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as ''[[Pankow]]'' (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in East Germany was referred to as [[Karlshorst]]).<ref name=zeit49 /> Over time, however, the abbreviation ''DDR'' was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.{{NoteTag|The use of the abbreviation ''BRD'' (FRG) for West Germany, the ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (''Federal Republic of Germany''), on the other hand, was never accepted in West Germany since it was considered a political statement. Thus ''BRD'' (FRG) was a term used by East Germans, or by West Germans who held a pro-East-German view. Colloquially, West Germans called West Germany simply \"Germany\" (reflecting West Germany's claim to represent the whole of Germany) or, alternatively, the ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' (federal republic, or federal territory, respectively), referring to the country, and ''Bundesb\u00fcrger'' (federal citizen[s]) for its citizens, with the adjective, ''bundesdeutsch'' (federal German).}}\n\nThe term ''Westdeutschland'' ([[West Germany]]), when used by West Germans, was almost always a reference to the geographic region of [[Western Germany]] and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Ritter]] (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces{{snd}}Soviet Communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media.

But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler{{snd}}see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich. Alternative Programme f\u00fcr das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46.

Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20</ref> These included: 1949\u201361, which saw the building of socialism; 1961\u20131970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u201385 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u201389 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Further|Constitution of East Germany}}\n\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nThe Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.\n* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Berlin, Palast der Republik -- um 1990 -- 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palast der Republik]], the seat of the [[Volkskammer]]]]\n[[File:Berlin DDR.jpg|thumb|Poster with the inscription \"Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR\", 1967]]\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|22|02|00|N|81|24|00|W|}}\n|  zoom =   10\n| width =  217\n| height = 250\n| caption = [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island]] was gifted to East Germany in 1972 by Cuba as an act of fraternity, although the resulting status of the island is now unclear.<ref>{{cite web|website=Deutsche Welle (DW)|url=http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|title=Castro's Caribbean island gift to East Germany|date=27 November 2016|author=Nik Martin|access-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320053848/http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n| minimap = file\n| mini-file = LocationCuba.svg\n| mini-width = 100\n| mini-height = 50\n| minipog-x = 56\n| minipog-y = 17\n| scalemark = 105\n| mark-coord =       {{coord|22.033333|-81.4}}\n|      label =       Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island\n| label-color=       black\n|  label-pos =       top\n| mark-title =       Ernst Th\u00e4llman Island\n}}\n\nThe member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\n\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.\n\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarit\u00e4t''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke''). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.<ref>Mary Elise Sarotte, ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe'' (Second Edition) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|right|A woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in East Germany in 1984.

The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982.

Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:en:Construction soldier|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany.

Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda.

The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]].

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430.

Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983.

These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him.

His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. Minotto and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nTo the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, with Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Pegae Gate]] with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The [[Princes' Islands]] in the Sea of Marmara were taken by [[Suleiman Baltoghlu|Admiral Baltoghlu]]'s fleet.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|96\u201397}} Mehmed's massive cannon fired on the walls for weeks, but due to its imprecision and extremely slow rate of reloading the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, limiting the cannon's effect.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}}\n\n[[File:Kusatma Zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ottoman Turks transport their fleet overland into the [[Golden Horn]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under [[Suleiman Baltoghlu]] could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had previously stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city.

Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched. On the Byzantine side, a small Venetian fleet of 12 ships, after having searched the Aegean, reached the Capital on May 27 and reported to the Emperor that no large Venetian relief fleet was on its way.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|377}} On May 28, as the Ottoman army prepared for the final assault, large-scale religious processions were held in the city. In the evening a last solemn ceremony was held in the [[Hagia Sophia]], in which the Emperor and representatives of both the Latin and Greek church partook, together with nobility from both sides.<ref name=\"vasilievhistbyz2\" />{{rp|651\u2013652}}\n\nShortly after midnight on May 29 the all-out offensive began. The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the land troops,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"isbesepistle\" /><ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> [[Giovanni Giustiniani]], was grievously wounded during the attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders.{{NoteTag|Sources hostile towards the Genoese (such as the Venetian Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro), however, report that Longo was only lightly wounded or not wounded at all, but, overwhelmed by fear, simulated the wound to abandon the battlefield, determining the fall of the city.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward. According to some Ottoman sources Constantine was killed in an accidental encounter with Turkish marines a little further to the south, presumably while making his way to the Sea of Marmara in order to escape by sea.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\nAfter the initial assault, the Ottoman Army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help him better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection. After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets.\n\nOttoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be very heavy due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault.{{cn|date=February 2020}} According to the Venetian surgeon Nicolo Barbaro \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\".

Four days later on 2 June, the Sultan would find the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable and stores and shops were emptied.

Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460.

In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[capital city]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by an invading [[Ottoman army]] on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively.

The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days.

Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. They were placed under the command of [[Zagan Pasha]]. However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward.

The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn.

[[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] and [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore]].<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}} Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.

It station is built along alongside [[Bayfront Avenue]].\n\nWhen Stage 3 of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] opens in 2021, Marina Bay station will become a triple-line interchange, joining [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT station]] and [[Outram Park MRT station]].

The station requires significant diversion and land reclamation works at Marina Bay to facilitate the development of New Downtown.\n\nOn 8 January 2006, this station was one of the four stations that participated in [[Counter-terrorism in Singapore#Exercise Northstar V|Exercise Northstar V]].\n\nBefore regular southbound trains were scheduled to terminate at [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] from 13 March 2017 (Mondays - Fridays)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBe4SZDt5fA&t=163s Train services extended to Marina South Pier on weekdays]</ref>, 16 April 2017 (Sundays)<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=3e93bed1-e3c4-47aa-941c-d0f317ba03c5 Factsheet by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) & SMRT: Full-day Sunday Trial of New Signalling System for North-South Line from 16 April 2017]</ref> as well as 13 May 2017 (Saturdays), platforms at Marina Bay were used both for train turnarounds and trains heading to/from Marina South Pier.

While the exits remain the same, it also allows the walking of 500 metres to the [[Downtown MRT station]]. It was an integral part of the Marina Bay development and interchange for two major MRT lines. Marina Bay station is also located in the public park, to be similar to Central Linear Park. The design aims to integrate the station into the park through the landscaping. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light penetrating into the underground hall. To further minimise the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, the lift, escalators, lightweight canopy and the reflective pool were visible from the street level, giving users full view of the park from the station entrance, similar to [[Bras Basah MRT station|Bras Basah]]. In addition, while the platforms at basement 1 are accessible only from the ticket concourse at basement 2, it is the first underground station to do the reverse, starting from the platforms at B1 and ending at the concourse at B2.<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=1891 LTA awards civil contract for Marina Bay MRT Station]</ref>\n\nThe station was awarded the winner of the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/world-architecture-festival-winners-2012|title=World Architecture Festival Winners 2012|publisher=EMAP publishing|accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Circle Line Stage 6====\nThe station was announced on 29 October 2015 as part of the Stage 6 of the Circle line.

Knight struck a deal with him that in October, paying his bail, freed him from prison\u2014pending his conviction's appeal\u2014while signing him to Deathrow Records. In 1996, the label released 2Pac's greatest commercial success, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Yet that September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted [[Orlando Anderson]], a Southside Compton [[Crips]] gang member. Three hours later someone shot into the car that Knight was driving and fatally wounded Shakur, and Anderson has since become the prime suspect.\n\nIn the fallout from and the aftermath of Shakur's death, both Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg left Deathrow Records. Rapidly, the label declined, and it was soon eclipsed. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, had often plied intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of [[probation]] and [[parole]].

The Biggie theory formed the basis of a {{US$|500{{nbsp}}million}} lawsuit by his family, the Wallaces, against the city of Los Angeles. A key source for Poole's theory was Kevin Hackie. Hackie had implicated Suge Knight and [[David Mack (police officer)|David Mack]].

Knight struck a deal with him that in October, paying his bail, freed him from prison\u2014pending his conviction's appeal\u2014while signing him to Deathrow Records. In 1996, the label released 2Pac's greatest commercial success, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Yet that September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted [[Orlando Anderson]], a Southside Compton [[Crips]] gang member. Three hours later someone shot into the car that Knight was driving and fatally wounded Shakur, and Anderson has since become the prime suspect.\n\nIn the fallout from and the aftermath of Shakur's death, both Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg left Deathrow Records. Rapidly, the label declined, and it was soon eclipsed. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, had often plied intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of [[probation]] and [[parole]]. In September 2018, upon pleading [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to [[voluntary manslaughter]] in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run, Knight was sentenced to 28 years in prison.<ref name=\"thewrap92018\">{{cite news |last= Kenneally |first=Tim |title= Suge Knight to Serve 28 Years Over 2015 Hit-and-Run Death |url= https://www.thewrap.com/suge-knight-to-serve-28-years-2015-hit-run-death/ |accessdate = September 20, 2018|work=[[TheWrap]] |date= September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"latimesfeb2015\">{{cite news |last1=Gerber |first1=Marisa |title='Suge' Knight charged with murder; could face life in prison |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-suge-knights-bail-revoked-20150202-story.html |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> He is scheduled to become eligible for parole in October 2037.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=BH6458|title=Inmate Information|last=|first=|date=|website=CDCR Inmate Locator|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMarion Hugh Knight Jr. was born in [[Compton, California]], the son of Maxine (n\u00e9e Dikemen) and Marion Knight Sr.<ref name=\"Chosen by Fate\">{{cite book |last=Lee |first1=McKinley |last2=Williams |first2=Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gp-fAAAAMAAJ&q=Maxine+Chatman&dq=Maxine+Chatman |title=Chosen by Fate: My Life Inside Death Row Records |location=West Hollywood, CA |publisher=Dove Books |year=1997 |isbn=9780787114329 |accessdate=January 31, 2015 }}</ref> His name Suge (pronounced ''Shoog'') derives from \"Sugar Bear\", a childhood nickname.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D91039F937A25752C0A960958260 |title=Does a Sugar Bear Bite? |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |work=The New York Times |date=February 2, 1997 |accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> He attended [[Lynwood High School]] in nearby [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], where he was a [[American football|football]] and [[Track and field|track]] star.

His first big profit in the business came when [[Vanilla Ice]] (Robert Van Winkle) agreed to sign over royalties from his smash hit \"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\", because the song included material allegedly written by Knight's client Mario Johnson. Knight and his bodyguards confronted Van Winkle several times. On one occasion, Knight entered Van Winkle's hotel room and allegedly dangled him by his ankles off the balcony. Van Winkle said only that Knight threatened to throw him off the balcony; the claim was resolved in court.<ref name=\"SKbio\" />\n\nKnight next formed an artist management company and signed prominent [[West Coast hip hop]] artists [[DJ Quik]] and [[The D.O.C.]] Through the latter, he met several members of the seminal [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]].\n\n==Death Row Records==\nDr. Dre and The D.O.C. wanted to leave both N.W.A and their label, [[Ruthless Records]], run by [[Eazy-E]], another member of N.W.A.

Tupac Shakur was shot four times in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13. When Shakur's [[Gangsta rap#East Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast-West Coast feud|East Coast rival]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] ([[Pseudonym|AKA]] Biggie Smalls), was murdered in a similar drive-by shooting in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on March 9, 1997, speculation arose that Knight was involved and that Biggie's death was a revenge killing.<ref name=\"Kading1\">[http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/10/tupac_biggie_murder_video.php VIDEO: Greg Kading's Book Says Sean Combs, Suge Knight Ordered Tupac and Biggie Killings] By LA Weekly Mon., October 3, 2011</ref> Former Death Row artists, including Snoop Dogg, also later accused Knight of being involved in Tupac's murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/snoopBeefs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329040342/http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/snoopBeefs.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 29, 2007|title=RapCentral.co.uk - SNOOP DOGG BEEF INFO FOR ALL HIS BEEFS WITH SUGE KNIGHT, THE EASTSIDAZ AND MORE|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA theory accusing Suge Knight in the deaths of both Biggie and Tupac was that of ex-detective [[Russell Poole]], who conjectured that Knight had Tupac killed before he could part ways with Knight's label and then conspired to kill Biggie to divert attention from himself in the Tupac case.<ref name=\"Broomfield's Biggie and Tupac reviewed by the Courant\">{{cite news|last=Danton|first=Eric|title=Biggie (rip) Vs.

Hackie had implicated Suge Knight and [[David Mack (police officer)|David Mack]]. Hackie, a former Death Row associate, said that he had knowledge of involvement between Suge Knight and David Mack and other LAPD officers.

And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day.

The Garhajis were described as being nomads who had a reputation of being fine warriors and who were very skilled [[equestrians]], and were noted to be among the best horsemen and in possession of the best breed of Horses among the Somali.\n\nDescription of the Garhajis by C.J Cruttenden in the 1840s:\n\n<blockquote>The Haber Gerhajis, the eldest branch of the three tribes of Ishaak, reside chiefly in the mountains to the south of berbera, whence they extend to the country of Ogahden.

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

Like all of the natives of Somaliland they are nomads, wandering from place to place in search of water and pasture for their flocks and herds...The Habr Yunis warriors commenced to give an exhibition of their horsemanship, riding away singly or in pairs advancing to the attack, thrusting with the spear and guarding with the shield on which the point of the spear was received. They had fine horses, much superior to our own, and in the best condition.<ref>Outing: Sport, Adventure, Travel, Fiction, Volume 39</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to military historian Roy Irons, Major J.

In 1841 Sharmarke with 50 [[Matchlock]] men, 2 [[cannons]] and an army of mounted spearmen managed to invade Zeila and depose its Arab Governor, Mohammed Al Barr. Sharmarke used the canons to fire at the city walls which frightened Al Barr's followers and caused them to flee. Sharmarke succeeded Al Barr as the ruler of Zeila and its dependencies.<ref>First footseps in to Africa, by Richard Burton, p.16-p.30</ref><ref> Sun, sand and Somals; leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland, by Rayne Henry. p.15-16</ref> Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden.<ref>Ethiopia: the Era of the Princes: The Challenge of Islam and Re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855. p.18 </ref> Having secured Zeila, in 1845 Sharmarke moved on to Berbera which at the time was experiencing instability as a result of a war between the [[Habr Awal]] Reer Yunis Nur and Reer Ahmed Nur sub-clans over the control of Berbera's trade. Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men. A war ensued with in the city as Reer Yunis Nuh tried gain a foothold within Berbera, the Reer Yunis Nuh were no match for Sharmarke and his modern weapons and thus failed.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F. L. (Frank Linsly) 1851-1890; Thrupp, James Godfrey. p. 264.</ref> The Habr Yunis then proceeded to expand into Doolo region and took control of watering wells, grazing land and looted thousands of camels from the Cabdille, Makahil, Ali and Haroun sub clans of the Ogaden, forcing them to leave their homeland and flee south to [[Hiiraan]]. This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]].

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British.

Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Habar Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F. L. (Frank Linsly) 1851-1890; Thrupp, James Godfrey. p. 264.</ref> The Habr Yunis then proceeded to expand into Doolo region and took control of watering wells, grazing land and looted thousands of camels from the Cabdille, Makahil, Ali and Haroun sub clans of the Ogaden, forcing them to leave their homeland and flee south to [[Hiiraan]]. This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners.

The Eidagale caravan merchants founded several inland trade [[entrep\u00f4ts]] in the interior, which also includes the modern city of [[Hargeisa]], founded in the 19th century as a caravan junction between [[Berbera]] and the Somali interior.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=\nAn Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of African Languages|date=1963|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=27|language=english}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Seventeen Trips Through Somaliland and a Visit to Abyssinia|last=Carlos-Swayne|first=Harald|publisher=|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}</ref>\n\n===Sultans of the Eidagale===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Abdi Eisa''' ('Traditional Chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1680\n|1750\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Guled ''' Abdi (''First Sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1750\n|1808\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Farah''' ''Sultan'' Guled\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1808\n|1845\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hassan''' ''Sultan'' Farah\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1845\n|1870\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriye''' ''Sultan'' Hassan\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1870\n|1939\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Abdilahi''' ''Sultan'' Diriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1939\n|1967\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Rashid''' '' Sultan'' Abdilahi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1967\n|1969\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Abdulkadir''' ''Sultan'' Rashid\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1969\n|1975\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Mohamed''' ''Sultan'' Abdikadir\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1975\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==Sultanate of the Habr Yunis==\n\n[[File:Sultan Nur Map.png|thumb|500px|1896 German map showing Sultan Nur's Domain in the [[Togdheer]] area]]\nThe Habr Yunis Sultanate was a Somali Kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Kingdom's territory encompassed the lands settled by the Habr Yunis tribe of the Garhajis clan. The Habr Yunis Sultans received a tax in the form of an annual tribute of livestock from their subjects and they regularly taxed the trade caravans that went through their territory. Moreover, the sultanate had a significant standing army which was used to enforce the taxation, as well as to defend their realm.<ref > The Journal of The anthropological institute of Great Britain and Ireland| Vol.21 p. 161 </ref><ref > Journal of the East Africa Natural History Society: Official Publication of the Coryndon Memorial Museum Vol.17 p. 76</ref> \n\nThe first Habr Yunis chief to assume the title Sultan was Sugulleh Ainanshe of the Ismail Arrah clan, his father Ainanshe was a traditional chief. Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Habar Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

Throughout the year, series of typhoons impacted the country, with the worst damage occurring during September and October from Typhoons Ketsana and Parma.\n\nThe season started by the formation of Tropical Depression Auring during early of the year which affected southern Philippines with moderate damages. Only two storms, Bising and Crising, developed during the weak first third of the season, with later Dante and Emong forming and impacting [[Luzon]] during the first week of May. Tropical Storm Feria impacted most of the country with severe damages during June. A series of weak storms developed continuously during July.\n\nTyphoon Kiko only brushed the norther part of the Philippine's area of Responsibility while enhancing the [[southwest monsoon]], which caused heavy flooding throughout the country. During late-September, combined with the enhancement of the monsoon, Ondoy formed and affected most of the country with an extreme death toll and extensive damages. Typhoons Pepeng and Quedan formed along a week after Ondoy, but both typhoons [[Fujiwhara effect|interacted]] together which made Pepeng affect northern Luzon for a long time. During late-October to early-November, Typhoon Santi made landfall over central Luzon with major damages. Vinta was the last storm to enter or form within the PAR during the season without even affecting the country.\n\n<div class=\"noprint\" style=\"clear:right; border:solid #aaa 1px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:85%; line-height:1.5; background:#f9f9f9; width:250px; padding:4px; spacing:0; text-align:left; float:right;\">\n{|\n|-\n|rowspan=4| '''Related articles'''\n|'''[[2009 Pacific typhoon season]]'''\n|-\n|[[Timeline of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season]]\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Seasonal statistics==\n[[File:2009 Pacific typhoon season summary.png|thumb|left|Tracks of all tropical cyclones in the western Pacific basin during 2009]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center;\"\n|- \"\n!

Throughout the year, series of typhoons impacted the country, with the worst damage occurring during September and October from Typhoons Ketsana and Parma.\n\nThe season started by the formation of Tropical Depression Auring during early of the year which affected southern Philippines with moderate damages. Only two storms, Bising and Crising, developed during the weak first third of the season, with later Dante and Emong forming and impacting [[Luzon]] during the first week of May. Tropical Storm Feria impacted most of the country with severe damages during June. A series of weak storms developed continuously during July.\n\nTyphoon Kiko only brushed the norther part of the Philippine's area of Responsibility while enhancing the [[southwest monsoon]], which caused heavy flooding throughout the country. During late-September, combined with the enhancement of the monsoon, Ondoy formed and affected most of the country with an extreme death toll and extensive damages. Typhoons Pepeng and Quedan formed along a week after Ondoy, but both typhoons [[Fujiwhara effect|interacted]] together which made Pepeng affect northern Luzon for a long time. During late-October to early-November, Typhoon Santi made landfall over central Luzon with major damages. Vinta was the last storm to enter or form within the PAR during the season without even affecting the country.\n\n<div class=\"noprint\" style=\"clear:right; border:solid #aaa 1px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:85%; line-height:1.5; background:#f9f9f9; width:250px; padding:4px; spacing:0; text-align:left; float:right;\">\n{|\n|-\n|rowspan=4| '''Related articles'''\n|'''[[2009 Pacific typhoon season]]'''\n|-\n|[[Timeline of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season]]\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Seasonal statistics==\n[[File:2009 Pacific typhoon season summary.png|thumb|left|Tracks of all tropical cyclones in the western Pacific basin during 2009]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center;\"\n|- \"\n!
