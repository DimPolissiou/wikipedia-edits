P. |authorlink2=Martin Seligman \n  | title = Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification.\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | year = 2004\n  | location = Oxford\n  | isbn = 0-19-516701-5}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of strengths and virtues ==\n{{main|Values in Action Inventory of Strengths}}\n\n''CSV'' identifies six classes of virtue (i.e. \"core virtues\") comprising 28 measurable \"character strengths\". The organization of the six virtues and 28 strengths is as follows:\n\n# '''Wisdom and Knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]\n# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]\n# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]\n# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], [[Justice|fairness]], [[leadership]]\n# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]\n# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]\n\n''CSV'' defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria. Character strengths are fulfilling; [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically valuable]], in an ethical sense ([[Intellectual giftedness|gifts]], [[skill]]s, [[aptitude]]s, and [[expert]]ise can be squandered, but character strengths and [[virtue]]s cannot); non-[[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]]; not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); [[Trait theory|trait-like]] (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); not a combination of the other character strengths in the ''CSV''; personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; observable in [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); absent in some individuals; and nurtured by societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[institution]]s.\n\nThe introduction of ''CSV'' suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that practicing these traits leads to increased happiness. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]] and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis.<ref name=\"CSV\" /> These arguments are in line with the [[science of morality]].\n\nEach of the 28 character traits is defined [[Behaviorism|behaviorally]], with [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] evidence demonstrating that it can be [[Reliability (statistics)|reliably]] measured.\nThe book shows that \"empirically minded [[Humanism|humanists]] can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner.\"<ref name=\"Cloninger\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Cloninger\n  | first = C.

Each trait \"provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being.\"<ref name=\"Cloninger\" /> Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness or disorder]].\n\nFinally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 28 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 28 original traits.<ref>Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F.

Character strengths are fulfilling; [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically valuable]], in an ethical sense ([[Intellectual giftedness|gifts]], [[skill]]s, [[aptitude]]s, and [[expert]]ise can be squandered, but character strengths and [[virtue]]s cannot); non-[[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]]; not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); [[Trait theory|trait-like]] (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV; personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; observable in [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); absent in some individuals; and nurtured by societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[institution]]s.\n\nThe introduction of CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that practicing these traits leads to increased happiness. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]] and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis.<ref name=\"CSV\" /> These arguments are in line with the [[science of morality]].\n\nEach of the 28 character traits is defined [[Behaviorism|behaviorally]], with [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] evidence demonstrating that it can be [[Reliability (statistics)|reliably]] measured.\nThe book shows that \"empirically minded [[Humanism|humanists]] can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner.\"<ref name=\"Cloninger\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Cloninger\n  | first = C.

Each trait \"provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being.\"<ref name=\"Cloninger\" /> Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness or disorder]].\n\nFinally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 28 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 28 original traits.<ref>Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F.

The track is {{convert|0.596|mi|km|abbr=on}} long. Inside the larger oval is a {{convert|1/4|mi|km|abbr=on}} paved oval.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe track was converted to a {{convert|1/2|mi|km|abbr=on}} paved oval in 1957, when it began to be a NASCAR series track. The speedway was lengthened between the 1969 and 1970 seasons. The corners were cut down from 35 degrees to their present 18 degrees in 1972. The track was repaved between the 1995 and 1996 seasons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Track history==\n[[File:1911 nashville fairgrounds.jpg|thumb|left|1911 race at the Fairgrounds]]\n\nThe track first featured \"horseless carriages\" and motorcycles on June 11, 1904, on a {{convert|1+1/8|mi|km|abbr=on}} dirt oval. Races were canceled after a motorcycle ran into the back of a car that was lining up. [[Harness racing|Harness horse racing]] events were also held at the track.\n\nIn September 1904 another series of races was organized. Most of the entrants came directly to Nashville from the [[1904 World's Fair]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Racing pioneer [[Barney Oldfield]] was one of the entrants. People marveled at cars driving over {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.\n\nThe track began holding annual events in September 1915 to coincide with the state fair. Many of the same drivers from the [[Indianapolis 500]] brought their cars down to Nashville.\n\nLocal tracks sprang up and began running weekly Saturday night shows (collectively called the \"Legion Bowl\"), and the local racers competed at the track for the 1954 through 1957 State Fairs. In 1958 car racers decided to build a paved racetrack. The racers ended opposition from horse racers by building a horse track. The racers got a 10-year lease from the state fair board in order to build a paved {{frac|1|2}} mile track which shared the frontstretch with a {{frac|1|4}} mile track. On July 19, 1958, the first race was held at the new speedway. Races were held only on the {{frac|1|4}} mile track (except for special events).\n\nA 1959 NASCAR Grand National race of 200 laps in 1959 was unique; it was the first time an entire starting field (12 of 12 cars) finished the race,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1959_Music_City_200/W |title=1959 Music City 200 |work=Racing Reference |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref> one of four instances it has happened in Cup Series history.  That would not happen again until 36 years later, when the entire field at the 1995 Tyson Holly Farms 400 finished the race.\n\nThe original cars (since 1948) were 1930s model cars called \"Modified Specials\". By 1964 the parts for cars were too hard to find, so the track changed to newer 1950s model cars called \"Late Model Modifieds\". Some of the early stars of the track decided to retire.\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s also frequently brought drivers from outside Nashville, most notably the [[Alabama Gang]]. The Alabama Gang (from Hueytown, Alabama) included future NASCAR legends [[Bobby Allison]], [[Donnie Allison]], and Nashville native [[Red Farmer]].\n\n[[Coo Coo Marlin]] was the first back-to-back champion in 1965/1966. 1968 champion P.B. Crowell decided to retire, and hired the talented young [[Darrell Waltrip]] to drive his car.  Country music legend [[Marty Robbins]] raced often at the track in his signature purple and yellow race cars.\n\nSeveral changes happened at the track in the 1960s. Lights were added to the {{frac|1|2}} mile track in 1965, and races in the main division moved to the big track. A fire burned the grandstands at the 1965 State Fair. Weekly Tuesday night races were added, and fans were awed by the crazy Figure-8 drivers barely missing each other as they crossed each other's paths. New grandstands were built and the track was lengthened (and banked to 35 degrees) in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nThe bankings in the corners proved to be too fast, so the banking was reduce to 18 degrees. The new ownership decided to hold no weekly races in 1979.\n\nThe 1970s also featured talented drivers that would progress to NASCAR's highest division. Second generation drivers Sterling Marlin (son of Coo Coo) and Steve Spencer (NASCAR) Mike Alexander (NASCAR) (son of car owner R.C.) were all track champions.

Inside the larger oval is a {{convert|1/4|mi|km|abbr=on}} paved oval.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe track was converted to a {{convert|1/2|mi|km|abbr=on}} paved oval in 1957, when it began to be a NASCAR series track. The speedway was lengthened between the 1969 and 1970 seasons. The corners were cut down from 35 degrees to their present 18 degrees in 1972. The track was repaved between the 1995 and 1996 seasons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Track history==\n[[File:1911 nashville fairgrounds.jpg|thumb|left|1911 race at the Fairgrounds]]\n\nThe track first featured \"horseless carriages\" and motorcycles on June 11, 1904, on a {{convert|1+1/8|mi|km|abbr=on}} dirt oval. Races were canceled after a motorcycle ran into the back of a car that was lining up. [[Harness racing|Harness horse racing]] events were also held at the track.\n\nIn September 1904 another series of races was organized. Most of the entrants came directly to Nashville from the [[1904 World's Fair]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Racing pioneer [[Barney Oldfield]] was one of the entrants. People marveled at cars driving over {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.\n\nThe track began holding annual events in September 1915 to coincide with the state fair. Many of the same drivers from the [[Indianapolis 500]] brought their cars down to Nashville.\n\nLocal tracks sprang up and began running weekly Saturday night shows (collectively called the \"Legion Bowl\"), and the local racers competed at the track for the 1954 through 1957 State Fairs. In 1958 car racers decided to build a paved racetrack. The racers ended opposition from horse racers by building a horse track. The racers got a 10-year lease from the state fair board in order to build a paved {{frac|1|2}} mile track which shared the frontstretch with a {{frac|1|4}} mile track. On July 19, 1958, the first race was held at the new speedway. Races were held only on the {{frac|1|4}} mile track (except for special events).\n\nA 1959 NASCAR Grand National race of 200 laps in 1959 was unique; it was the first time an entire starting field (12 of 12 cars) finished the race,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1959_Music_City_200/W |title=1959 Music City 200 |work=Racing Reference |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref> one of four instances it has happened in Cup Series history.  That would not happen again until 36 years later, when the entire field at the 1995 Tyson Holly Farms 400 finished the race.\n\nThe original cars (since 1948) were 1930s model cars called \"Modified Specials\". By 1964 the parts for cars were too hard to find, so the track changed to newer 1950s model cars called \"Late Model Modifieds\". Some of the early stars of the track decided to retire.\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s also frequently brought drivers from outside Nashville, most notably the [[Alabama Gang]]. The Alabama Gang (from Hueytown, Alabama) included future NASCAR legends [[Bobby Allison]], [[Donnie Allison]], and Nashville native [[Red Farmer]].\n\n[[Coo Coo Marlin]] was the first back-to-back champion in 1965/1966. 1968 champion P.B. Crowell decided to retire, and hired the talented young [[Darrell Waltrip]] to drive his car.  Country music legend [[Marty Robbins]] raced often at the track in his signature purple and yellow race cars.\n\nSeveral changes happened at the track in the 1960s. Lights were added to the {{frac|1|2}} mile track in 1965, and races in the main division moved to the big track. A fire burned the grandstands at the 1965 State Fair. Weekly Tuesday night races were added, and fans were awed by the crazy Figure-8 drivers barely missing each other as they crossed each other's paths. New grandstands were built and the track was lengthened (and banked to 35 degrees) in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nThe bankings in the corners proved to be too fast, so the banking was reduce to 18 degrees. The new ownership decided to hold no weekly races in 1979.\n\nThe 1970s also featured talented drivers that would progress to NASCAR's highest division. Second generation drivers Sterling Marlin (son of Coo Coo) and Steve Spencer (NASCAR) Mike Alexander (NASCAR) (son of car owner R.C.) were all track champions. Alabama Gang member Jimmy Means took the track title home to Alabama in 1974 before he moved on to NASCAR's Winston Cup.\n\n===1980s===\nThe track returned to hosting weekly races in 1980.
