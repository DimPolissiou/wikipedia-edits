In 1507, Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island. The island appears with a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name ''Cirne'' on early Portuguese maps, probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition.

The Dutch inhabited the island in 1638, from which they exploited [[ebony]] trees and introduced [[sugar cane]], [[domestic animals]] and [[deer]].

These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters.

However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats. In January 1968, six weeks before the declaration of independence the [[1968 Mauritian riots]] occurred in Port Louis leading to the deaths of 25 people.<ref name=\"mg\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiusmag.com/?p=598 |title=An eye witness account of the 1968 riots |website=www.mauritiusmag.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref><ref name=\"eisa\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/mauoverview7.htm |title=EISA Mauritius: The road to independence (1945\u20131968) |website=www.eisa.org.za |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stamp Mauritius 1954 5c.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Elizabeth II]] was [[Queen of Mauritius]] from 1968 to 1992.]]\nMauritius adopted a new constitution and independence was proclaimed on 12 March 1968.

In 1969, the opposition party [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] (MMM) led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] was founded. Later in 1971, the MMM, backed by unions, called a series of strikes in the port, which caused a state of emergency in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882731|publisher=BBC|title=Mauritius profile|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> The coalition government of the Labour Party and the PMSD (Parti Mauricien Social D\u00e9mocrate) reacted by curtailing civil liberties and curbing freedom of the press.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> Two unsuccessful assassination attempts were made against Paul B\u00e9renger.

However, ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM leadership. The power struggle between B\u00e9renger and Jugnauth peaked in March 1983. Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit; on his return, B\u00e9renger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the Prime Minister. At Jugnauth's request, PM [[Indira Gandhi]] of India planned an armed intervention involving the [[Indian Navy]] and [[Indian Army]] to prevent a [[coup]] under the code name [[Operation Lal Dora]].<ref>{{cite news|title=When India drew Top Secret 'red line' in Mauritius|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-india-drew-top-secret-red-line-in-mauritius/article4493495.ece|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Medcalf|first=Rory|title=When India (Almost) Invaded Mauritius|url=http://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2013/03/19/when-india-almost-invaded-mauritius/|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Diplomat|date=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Brewster|url= https://www.academia.edu/7992843|title=India's Ocean: the Story of India's Bid for Regional Leadership}}.

Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the ''Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act'', the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail. This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction in the education sector. There were not enough high-quality secondary colleges to answer the growing demand of primary school leavers who had got through their CPE (Certificate of Primary Education). In 1991, a master plan for education failed to get national support and contributed to the government's downfall.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\n[[Navin Ramgoolam]] was elected as prime minister in 1995.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented.

After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius}}\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Styles and forms introduced by Dutch, French, and British settlers from the seventeenth century onward, mixed with influences from India and East Africa, resulted in a unique hybrid architecture of international historic, social, and artistic significance. Mauritian structures present a variety of designs, materials, and decorative elements that are unique to the country and inform the historical context of the Indian Ocean and European colonialism.<ref name=\"wmf.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/traditional-architecture-mauritius|title=Traditional Architecture of Mauritius|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDecades of political, social, and economic change have resulted in the routine destruction of Mauritian architectural heritage. Between 1960 and 1980, the historic homes of the island's high grounds, known locally as campagnes, disappeared at alarming rates. More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage. Rising land values are pitted against the cultural value of historic structures in Mauritius, while the prohibitive costs of maintenance and the steady decline in traditional building skills make it harder to invest in preservation.<ref name=\"wmf.org\"/>\n\nThe general populace historically lived in what are termed creole houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagemauritius.org/vintage-houses/old-colonial-creole-style-houses-mauritius-part-1/|title=Old Colonial and Creole-Style Houses in Mauritius \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Vintage Mauritius|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Mauritian literature}}\nProminent Mauritian writers include [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert]], Malcolm de Chazal, [[Ananda Devi]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Khal Torabully]], [[J.

Le Cl\u00e9zio, who won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 2008, is of Mauritian heritage and holds dual French-Mauritian citizenship. The island plays host to the Le Prince Maurice Prize. In keeping with the island's literary culture the prize alternates on a yearly basis between English-speaking and French-speaking writers.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Mauritius|Sega (genre)}}\nThe major musical genres of Mauritius are [[Sega (genre)|Sega]] and its [[fusion genre]], [[Seggae]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] [[Indian folk music|folk songs]], [[Filmi|Indian movie music]] especially [[Bollywood]], and [[Classical music]] mainly [[Western classical music]] and [[Indian classical music]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Further|Cuisine of Mauritius}}\nThe [[cuisine of Mauritius]] is a combination of Indian, Creole, French and Chinese, with many dishes unique to the island. Spices are also a big part of Mauritian cuisine.\n'''ALOUDA''' is a delicious cold beverage made with milk, basil seeds and agar-agar jelly which is especially refreshing on a hot summer day.\n\n''Rougaille or rougail'' is one of the classic Mauritian dishes that everyone on the island loves. It is essentially a tomato-based dish, with incredibly rich flavours thanks to the combination of spices used.\n\n===Holidays and festivals===\nThe public holidays of Mauritius involve the blending of several cultures from Mauritius's history.

In 1507, Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island.

Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to Mauritius.<ref name=\"govt\"/> The swift conquest of Mauritius was fictionalised in the novel ''[[The Mauritius Command]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]], first published in 1977.\n\n===British Mauritius (1810\u20131968)===\n{{main|British Mauritius}}\n[[File:Combat de Grand Port mg 9425.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Grand Port]] between French and British naval forces, 1810]]\nThe British administration, which began with [[Robert Townsend Farquhar|Sir Robert Farquhar]] as [[Governor of British Mauritius|Governor]], led to rapid social and economic changes. However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane.

The result of the Tribunal's decision is that it is now open to the Parties to enter into the negotiations that the Tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the MPA, with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment, to the extent necessary under a \"sovereignty umbrella\".<ref name=\"cha\">{{cite web|url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/hansard/Documents/2015/hansard1215.pdf|title=Sixth National Assembly Parliamentary Debates(Hansard)|publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]]|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== International Court of Justice ====\n=====Amendment of exclusion clause by UK=====\nIn 2004, following the decision of the British government to promulgate the British Indian Ocean Territory Order, which prohibited the [[Chagossians]] from remaining on the islands without express authorisation, Mauritius contemplated recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] to finally and conclusively settle the dispute. However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Before the Portuguese arrival in 1507, there were no terrestrial mammals on the island. This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species. The arrival of humans saw the introduction of invasive alien species, the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna. Less than 2% of the [[Forest|native forest]] now remains, concentrated in the [[Black River Gorges National Park]] in the south-west, the Bambous Mountain Range in the south-east, and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the north-west. There are some isolated mountains, [[Corps de Garde]], [[Le Morne Brabant]], and several [[Islets of Mauritius|offshore islands]], with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity. Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented.

After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act.

{"title_page": "1997\u201398 OHL season", "text_new": "The '''1997\u201398 OHL season''' was the 18th season of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The VRD is considered a preferred candidate to use in a surgical display due to its combination of high resolution and high contrast and brightness. Additional tests show high potential for VRD to be used as a display technology for patients that have low vision.\n\n=====EyeTap=====\n\nThe [[EyeTap]] (also known as Generation-2 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212812/http://wearcam.org/glass.pdf \"GlassEyes\": The Theory of EyeTap Digital Eye Glass, supplemental material for IEEE Technology and Society, Volume Vol. 31, Number 3, 2012, pp. 10\u201314].</ref>) captures rays of light that would otherwise pass through the center of the lens of the wearer's eye, and substitutes synthetic computer-controlled light for each ray of real light.\n\nThe Generation-4 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\" /> (Laser EyeTap) is similar to the VRD (i.e. it uses a computer-controlled laser light source) except that it also has infinite depth of focus and causes the eye itself to, in effect, function as both a camera and a display by way of exact alignment with the eye and resynthesis (in laser light) of rays of light entering the eye.<ref>\"Intelligent Image Processing\", [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-471-40637-6}}, 384 p.</ref>\n\n=====Handheld=====\n\nA Handheld display employs a small display that fits in a user's hand.

Today [[Simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) markerless trackers such as PTAM (parallel tracking and mapping) are starting to come into use. Handheld display AR promises to be the first commercial success for AR technologies. The two main advantages of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of camera phones. The disadvantages are the physical constraints of the user having to hold the handheld device out in front of them at all times, as well as the distorting effect of classically wide-angled mobile phone cameras when compared to the real world as viewed through the eye.<ref>{{cite web |last=Feiner |first=Steve |title=Augmented reality: a long way off? |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/38869/augmented-reality-interview-steve-feiner |work=AR Week |publisher=Pocket-lint |accessdate=3 March 2011|date=3 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nGames such as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'' and ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' utilize an [[Image Linked Map]] (ILM) interface, where approved [[geotagged]] locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with.<ref>{{cite web |last=Borge |first=Ariel |title=The story behind 'Pok\u00e9mon Go's' impressive mapping |url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/10/john-hanke-pokemon-go/ |date=11 July 2016 |work=[[Mashable]] |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====Spatial=====\n\n[[Projection mapping|Spatial augmented reality]] (SAR) augments real-world objects and scenes, without the use of special displays such as monitors, head-mounted displays or hand-held devices. SAR makes use of digital projectors to display graphical information onto physical objects. The key difference in SAR is that the display is separated from the users of the system. Since the displays are not associated with each user, SAR scales naturally up to groups of users, allowing for collocated collaboration between users.\n\nExamples include [[shader lamps]], mobile projectors, virtual tables, and smart projectors. Shader lamps mimic and augment reality by projecting imagery onto neutral objects. This provides the opportunity to enhance the object's appearance with materials of a simple unit\u2014a projector, camera, and sensor.\n\nOther applications include table and wall projections. One innovation, the Extended Virtual Table, separates the virtual from the real by including [[beam splitter|beam-splitter]] mirrors attached to the ceiling at an adjustable angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1162/105474601753272862|title = The Extended Virtual Table: An Optical Extension for Table-Like Projection Systems|journal = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume = 10|issue = 6|pages = 613\u2013631|year = 2001|last1 = Bimber|first1 = Oliver|last2 = Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o|first2 = L.

Many more implementations and configurations make spatial augmented reality display an increasingly attractive interactive alternative.\n\nA SAR system can display on any number of surfaces in an indoor setting at once. SAR supports both a graphical visualization and passive [[Haptic perception|haptic]] sensation for the end users.

However, they often rely on computationally intensive computer vision algorithms with extreme latency requirements. To compensate for the lack of computing power, offloading data processing to a distant machine is often desired. Computation offloading introduces new constraints in applications, especially in terms of latency and bandwidth.

The software must derive real world coordinates, independent of camera, and camera images.

An '''augogram''' is a computer generated image that is used to create AR. '''Augography''' is the science and software practice of making augograms for AR.\n\nUsually those methods consist of two parts. The first stage is to detect [[interest point detection|interest points]], fiducial markers or [[optical flow]] in the camera images. This step can use [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection]] methods like [[corner detection]], [[blob detection]], [[edge detection]] or [[Thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]], and other [[image processing]] methods.<ref>State, Andrei; Hirota, Gentaro; Chen, David T; Garrett, William; Livingston, Mark.

Some methods assume objects with known geometry (or fiducial markers) are present in the scene. In some of those cases the scene 3D structure should be calculated beforehand. If part of the scene is unknown simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can map relative positions. If no information about scene geometry is available, [[structure from motion]] methods like [[bundle adjustment]] are used. Mathematical methods used in the second stage include: [[projective geometry|projective]] ([[Epipolar geometry|epipolar]]) geometry, [[geometric algebra]], [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|rotation representation]] with [[Rotation matrix#Exponential map|exponential map]], [[Kalman filter|kalman]] and [[Particle filter|particle]] filters, [[nonlinear optimization]], [[robust statistics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[Augmented Reality Markup Language]] (ARML) is a data standard developed within the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC),<ref>{{cite web | title = ARML 2.0 SWG| work = Open Geospatial Consortium website | publisher = Open Geospatial Consortium | url = http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/arml2.0swg| accessdate = 12 November 2013 }}</ref> which consists of Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) grammar to describe the location and appearance of virtual objects in the scene, as well as [[ECMAScript for XML|ECMAScript]] bindings to allow dynamic access to properties of virtual objects.\n\nTo enable rapid development of augmented reality applications, some software development kits (SDKs) have emerged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://augmentedrealitynews.org/ar-sdk/top-5-augmented-reality-sdks/|title=Top 5 AR SDKs|website=|publisher=Augmented Reality News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813170057/https://augmentedrealitynews.org/ar-sdk/top-5-augmented-reality-sdks/|archive-date=13 August 2013|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://augmentedworldexpo.com/news/tutorial-top-10-mobile-augmented-reality-sdks-for-developers//|title = Top 10 AR SDKs|publisher = Augmented World Expo|accessdate = 15 November 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131123011106/http://augmentedworldexpo.com/news/tutorial-top-10-mobile-augmented-reality-sdks-for-developers/|archive-date = 23 November 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe implementation of augmented reality in consumer products requires considering the design of the applications and the related constraints of the technology platform. Since AR systems rely heavily on the immersion of the user and the interaction between the user and the system, design can facilitate the adoption of virtuality. For most augmented reality systems, a similar design guideline can be followed. The following lists some considerations for designing augmented reality applications:\n\n====Environmental/context design====\n\nContext Design focuses on the end-user's physical surrounding, spatial space, and accessibility that may play a role when using the AR system. Designers should be aware of the possible physical scenarios the end-user may be in such as:\n* Public, in which the users use their whole body to interact with the software\n* Personal, in which the user uses a smartphone in a public space\n* Intimate, in which the user is sitting with a desktop and is not really moving\n* Private, in which the user has on a wearable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-principles-of-good-user-experience-design-for-augmented-reality-d8e22777aabd|title=\"The Principles of Good UX for Augmented Reality \u2013 UX Collective.\" UX Collective|last=Wilson|first=Tyler|date=30 January 2018|website=|access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy evaluating each physical scenario, potential safety hazards can be avoided and changes can be made to greater improve the end-user's immersion. [[User experience|UX designers]] will have to define user journeys for the relevant physical scenarios and define how the interface reacts to each.\n\nEspecially in AR systems, it is vital to also consider the spatial and surrounding elements that change the effectiveness of the AR technology. Environmental elements such as lighting and sound can prevent the AR device sensor from detecting necessary data and ruin the immersion of the end-user.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.igi-global.com/book/emerging-technologies-augmented-reality/338|title=Emerging Technologies of Augmented Reality: Interfaces and Design|last1=Haller|first1=Michael|last2=Billinghurst|first2=Mark|last3=Thomas|first3=Bruce|website=igi-global.com|access-date=|isbn=9781599040660|publisher=IGI Global|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of context design involves the design of the system's functionality and its ability to accommodate user preferences.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/google-vr/best-practices-mobile-ar-design/|title=Best Practices for Mobile AR Design- Google|date=13 December 2017|website=blog.google|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|title=Human Computer Interaction with Augmented Reality|website=eislab.fim.uni-passau.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525000513/http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While accessibility tools are common in basic application design, some consideration should be made when designing time-limited prompts (to prevent unintentional operations), audio cues and overall engagement time. It is important to note that in some situations, the application's functionality may hinder the user's ability. For example, applications that is used for driving should reduce the amount of user interaction and use audio cues instead.\n\n====Interaction design====\n\n[[Interaction design]] in augmented reality technology centers on the user's engagement with the end product to improve the overall user experience and enjoyment. The purpose of interaction design is to avoid alienating or confusing the user by organizing the information presented. Since user interaction relies on the user's input, designers must make system controls easier to understand and accessible. A common technique to improve usability for augmented reality applications is by discovering the frequently accessed areas in the device's touch display and design the application to match those areas of control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theblog.adobe.com/basic-patterns-of-mobile-navigation/|title=Basic Patterns of Mobile Navigation|date=9 May 2017|website=theblog.adobe.com|access-date=}}</ref> It is also important to structure the user journey maps and the flow of information presented which reduce the system's overall cognitive load and greatly improves the learning curve of the application.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|title=Principles of Mobile App Design: Engage Users and Drive Conversions|website=thinkwithgoogle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185621/https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn interaction design, it is important for developers to utilize augmented reality technology that complement the system's function or purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/inside-out-interaction-design-for-augmented-reality.php|title=Inside Out: Interaction Design for Augmented Reality-UXmatters|website=uxmatters.com|access-date=}}</ref> For instance, the utilization of exciting AR filters and the design of the unique sharing platform in [[Snapchat]] enables users to better the user's social interactions. In other applications that require users to understand the focus and intent, designers can employ a [[reticle]] or [[Ray casting|raycast]] from the device.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, augmented reality developers may find it appropriate to have digital elements scale or react to the direction of the camera and the context of objects that can are detected.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAugmented reality technology allows to utilize the introduction of [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]]. This means that a user can potentially access multiple copies of 2D interfaces within a single AR application.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n====Visual design====\n\nIn general, [[Visual design elements and principles|visual design]] is the appearance of the developing application that engages the user. To improve the graphic interface elements and user interaction, developers may use visual cues to inform the user what elements of UI are designed to interact with and how to interact with them. Since navigating in an AR application may appear difficult and seem frustrating, visual cue design can make interactions seem more natural.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn some augmented reality applications that use a 2D device as an interactive surface, the 2D control environment does not translate well in 3D space making users hesitant to explore their surroundings. To solve this issue, designers should apply visual cues to assist and encourage users to explore their surroundings.\n\nIt is important to note the two main objects in AR when developing VR applications: 3D [[volumetric]] objects that are manipulated and realistically interact with light and shadow; and animated media imagery such as images and videos which are mostly traditional 2D media rendered in a new context for augmented reality.<ref name=\":3\" /> When virtual objects are projected onto a real environment, it is challenging for augmented reality application designers to ensure a perfectly seamless integration relative to the real-world environment, especially with 2D objects. As such, designers can add weight to objects, use depths maps, and choose different material properties that highlight the object's presence in the real world. Another visual design that can be applied is using different [[computer graphics lighting|lighting]] techniques or casting shadows to improve overall depth judgment. For instance, a common lighting technique is simply placing a light source overhead at the 12&nbsp;o\u2019clock position, to create shadows on virtual objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Possible applications==\nAugmented reality has been explored for many applications, from gaming and entertainment to medicine, education and business. Example application areas described below include archaeology, architecture, commerce and education.

Computer-generated images of a structure can be superimposed onto a real-life local view of a property before the physical building is constructed there; this was demonstrated publicly by [[Trimble Navigation]] in 2004. AR can also be employed within an architect's workspace, rendering animated 3D visualizations of their 2D drawings. Architecture sight-seeing can be enhanced with AR applications, allowing users viewing a building's exterior to virtually see through its walls, viewing its interior objects and layout.<ref>Divecha, Devina.[http://www.designmena.com/inspiration/augmented-reality-ar-part-architecture-design Augmented Reality (AR) used in architecture and design].

As an example, astronomical constellations and the movements of objects in the solar system were oriented in 3D and overlaid in the direction the device was held, and expanded with supplemental video information. Paper-based science book illustrations could seem to come alive as video without requiring the child to navigate to web-based materials.\n\nIn 2013, a project was launched on [[Kickstarter]] to teach about electronics with an educational toy that allowed children to scan their circuit with an iPad and see the electric current flowing around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://circuits.lightup.io/|title=LightUp - An award-winning toy that teaches kids about circuits and coding|website=LightUp|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110100/https://circuits.lightup.io/|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While some educational apps were available for AR by 2016, it was not broadly used.

The first was \"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\" by Gerald Baron.<ref name=\"BARO13\">\"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\", ''Emergency Management Magazine'', 24 September 2009</ref> According to Adam Crowe: \"Technologies like augmented reality (ex: Google Glass) and the growing expectation of the public will continue to force professional emergency managers to radically shift when, where, and how technology is deployed before, during, and after disasters.\"<ref name=\"CROW13\">\"What Does the Future Hold for Emergency Management?\", Emergency Management Magazine, 8 November 2013</ref>\n\nAnother early example was a search aircraft looking for a lost hiker in rugged mountain terrain. Augmented reality systems provided aerial camera operators with a geographic awareness of forest road names and locations blended with the camera video. The camera operator was better able to search for the hiker knowing the geographic context of the camera image. Once located, the operator could more efficiently direct rescuers to the hiker's location because the geographic position and reference landmarks were clearly labeled.<ref name=\"COOP07\">{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Joseph |title=Supporting Flight Control for UAV-Assisted Wilderness Search and Rescue Through Human Centered Interface Design |journal=Theses and Dissertations |date=15 November 2007 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1217/ }}</ref>\n\n===Social interaction===\nAR can be used to facilitate social interaction. An augmented reality social network framework called Talk2Me enables people to disseminate information and view others' advertised information in an augmented reality way. The timely and dynamic information sharing and viewing functionalities of Talk2Me help initiate conversations and make friends for users with people in physical proximity.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PERCOM.2018.8444578 |chapter=Talk2Me: A Framework for Device-to-Device Augmented Reality Social Network |title=2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Per ''Com'') |pages=1\u201310 |year=2018 |last1=Shu |first1=Jiayu |last2=Kosta |first2=Sokol |last3=Zheng |first3=Rui |last4=Hui |first4=Pan |isbn=978-1-5386-3224-6 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0de7cb3483a8d8f867e738250f16ba4f5efacc1f }}</ref> However, use of an AR headset can inhibit the quality of an interaction between two people if one isn't wearing one if the headset becomes a distraction. <ref>{{cite web |title=Effects of Augmented Reality on Social Interactions |url=https://www.electronicsdiary.com/2019/05/effects-of-augmented-reality-on-social.html |website=Electronics Diary}}</ref>\n\nAugmented reality also gives users the ability to practice different forms of social interactions with other people in a safe, risk-free environment. Hannes Kauffman, Associate Professor for Virtual Reality at TU [[Vienna]], says: \"In collaborative Augmented Reality multiple users may access a shared space populated by virtual objects, while remaining grounded in the real world. This technique is particularly powerful for educational purposes when users are collocated and can use natural means of communication (speech, gestures, etc.), but can also be mixed successfully with immersive VR or remote collaboration.\"{{cite quote|date=October 2019}} Hannes cites [[education]] as a potential use of this technology.\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|List of augmented reality software#Games|l1=List of augmented reality software \u00a7 Games}}\n[[File:Desjardins AR Augmented Reality Game, March 2013.png|thumb|upright|alt= An image from an AR mobile game | An AR mobile game using a trigger image as [[fiducial marker]]]]\n\nThe gaming industry embraced AR technology.

On 16 March 2011, [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] promoted an open licensed version of the feature film ''[[Zenith (film)|Zenith]]'' in the United States. Users who downloaded the BitTorrent client software were also encouraged to download and share Part One of three parts of the film. On 4 May 2011, Part Two of the film was made available on [[VODO]].

In their 1993 paper \"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\" the authors describe the use of map overlays applied to video from space surveillance telescopes. The map overlays indicated the trajectories of various objects in geographic coordinates. This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify and catalog potentially dangerous space debris.<ref name=\"ABER93\">Abernathy, M., Houchard, J., Puccetti, M., and Lambert, J,\"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\", Proceedings of 1993 Space Surveillance Workshop 30 March to 1 April 1993, pages 189-195</ref>\n\nStarting in 2003 the US Army integrated the SmartCam3D augmented reality system into the Shadow Unmanned Aerial System to aid sensor operators using telescopic cameras to locate people or points of interest. The system combined fixed geographic information including street names, points of interest, airports, and railroads with live video from the camera system. The system offered a \"picture in picture\" mode that allows it to show a synthetic view of the area surrounding the camera's field of view. This helps solve a problem in which the field of view is so narrow that it excludes important context, as if \"looking through a soda straw\". The system displays real-time friend/foe/neutral location markers blended with live video, providing the operator with improved situational awareness.\n\nAs of 2010, Korean researchers are looking to implement mine-detecting robots into the military. The proposed design for such a robot includes a mobile platform that is like a track which would be able to cover uneven distances including stairs. The robot's mine detection sensor would include a combination of metal detectors and [[Ground-penetrating radar]] to locate mines or [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. This unique design would be immeasurably helpful in saving lives of Korean soldiers.<ref name=\"Kang 2010\">{{cite proceedings |last1=Kang |first1=Seong Pal|last2=Choi|first2=Junho|last3=Suh|first3=Seung-Beum|last4=Kang|first4=Sungchul |title=Design of mine detection robot for Korean mine field |journal=2010 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts |date=October 2010 |pages=53\u201356 |doi=10.1109/ARSO.2010.5679622}}</ref>\n\nResearchers at USAF Research Lab (Calhoun, Draper et al.) found an approximately two-fold increase in the speed at which UAV sensor operators found points of interest using this technology.<ref name=\"CALH05\">Calhoun, G.

It has now become common in weather casting to display full motion video of images captured in real-time from multiple cameras and other imaging devices. Coupled with 3D graphics symbols and mapped to a common virtual geospatial model, these animated visualizations constitute the first true application of AR to TV.\n\nAR has become common in sports telecasting. Sports and entertainment venues are provided with see-through and overlay augmentation through tracked camera feeds for enhanced viewing by the audience. Examples include the yellow \"[[first down]]\" line seen in television broadcasts of [[American football]] games showing the line the offensive team must cross to receive a first down. AR is also used in association with football and other sporting events to show commercial advertisements overlaid onto the view of the playing area. Sections of [[rugby football|rugby]] fields and [[cricket]] pitches also display sponsored images. Swimming telecasts often add a line across the lanes to indicate the position of the current record holder as a race proceeds to allow viewers to compare the current race to the best performance. Other examples include hockey puck tracking and annotations of racing car performance and snooker ball trajectories.<ref name=\"recentadvances\">Azuma, Ronald; Balliot, Yohan; Behringer, Reinhold; Feiner, Steven; Julier, Simon; MacIntyre, Blair.

In September 2017, Snapchat updated its app to include a camera filter that allowed users to render an animated, cartoon version of themselves called \"[[Bitmoji]]\". These animated avatars would be projected in the real world through the camera, and can be photographed or video recorded.<ref>Wagner, Kurt. \"Snapchat's New Augmented Reality Feature Brings Your Cartoon Bitmoji into the Real World.\" Recode, Recode, 14 Sept. 2017, www.recode.net/2017/9/14/16305890/snapchat-bitmoji-ar-Facebook.</ref> In the same month, Snapchat also announced a new feature called \"Sky Filters\" that will be available on its app. This new feature makes use of augmented reality to alter the look of a picture taken of the sky, much like how users can apply the app's filters to other pictures. Users can choose from sky filters such as starry night, stormy clouds, beautiful sunsets, and rainbow.<ref>Miller, Chance. \"Snapchat's Latest Augmented Reality Feature Lets You Paint the Sky with New Filters.\" 9to5Mac, 9to5Mac, 25 Sept. 2017, 9to5mac.com/2017/09/25/how-to-use-snapchat-sky-filters/.</ref>\n\n==The dangers of AR==\n\n===Reality modifications===\nIn a paper titled \"Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO\u201d, researchers at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management claim the game caused \"a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called Pok\u00e9Stops, where users can play the game while driving.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Faccio |first1=Mara |last2=McConnell |first2=John J. |title=Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO |date=2017 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3073723 |ssrn=3073723 }}</ref> Using data from one municipality, the paper extrapolates what that might mean nationwide and concluded \"the increase in crashes attributable to the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon GO is 145,632 with an associated increase in the number of injuries of 29,370 and an associated increase in the number of fatalities of 256 over the period of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 2016.\" The authors extrapolated the cost of those crashes and fatalities at between $2bn and $7.3 billion for the same period. Furthermore, more than one in three surveyed advanced Internet users would like to edit out disturbing elements around them, such as garbage or graffiti.<ref>Peddie, J., 2017, Agumented Reality, Springer{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> They would like to even modify their surroundings by erasing street signs, billboard ads, and uninteresting shopping windows. So it seems that AR is as much a threat to companies as it is an opportunity. Although, this could be a nightmare to numerous brands that do not manage to capture consumer imaginations it also creates the risk that the wearers of augmented reality glasses may become unaware of surrounding dangers. Consumers want to use augmented reality glasses to change their surroundings into something that reflects their own personal opinions. Around two in five want to change the way their surroundings look and even how people appear to them.\n\nNext, to the possible privacy issues that are described below, overload and over-reliance issues are the biggest danger of AR. For the development of new AR-related products, this implies that the user-interface should follow certain guidelines as not to overload the user with information while also preventing the user from over-relying on the AR system such that important cues from the environment are missed.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Azuma |first1=Ronald T. |title=A Survey of Augmented Reality |journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments |date=August 1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=355\u2013385 |doi=10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355 |citeseerx=10.1.1.35.5387 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fdc075d1cc14d64c11c3c860e86a082b761f4a0 }}</ref> This is called the virtually-augmented key.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\"/> Once the key is ignored, people might not desire the real world anymore.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\nThe concept of modern augmented reality depends on the ability of the device to record and analyze the environment in real time. Because of this, there are potential legal concerns over privacy. While the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] allows for such recording in the name of public interest, the constant recording of an AR device makes it difficult to do so without also recording outside of the public domain. Legal complications would be found in areas where a right to a certain amount of privacy is expected or where copyrighted media are displayed.\n\nIn terms of individual privacy, there exists the ease of access to information that one should not readily possess about a given person. This is accomplished through facial recognition technology. Assuming that AR automatically passes information about persons that the user sees, there could be anything seen from social media, criminal record, and marital status.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1145/2638728.2641709 |chapter=Augmented reality |title=Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing Adjunct Publication - UbiComp '14 Adjunct |pages=1283\u20131288 |year=2014 |last1=Roesner |first1=Franziska |last2=Kohno |first2=Tadayoshi |last3=Denning |first3=Tamara |last4=Calo |first4=Ryan |last5=Newell |first5=Bryce Clayton |isbn=978-1-4503-3047-3 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9acde5d5b02484f4296712c522fb2bf0024eafbe }}</ref>\n\nThe Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation, which was originally introduced by [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] in 2004 and further refined with [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Marvin Minsky]] in 2013, was ultimately ratified at the Virtual Reality Toronto conference on June 25, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ebrary.net/123089/sociology/code_ethics_human_augmentation|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation - Augmented Reality : Where We Will All Live -|website=m.ebrary.net|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-future-of-tech-just-c_b_10929608|title=The Future of Tech Just Changed at VRTO--Here's Why That Matters to You|last=Damiani|first=Jesse|last2=|first2=|date=2016-07-18|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2016/07/vrto-spearheads-code-of-ethics-on-human-augmentation/|title=VRTO Spearheads Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=VRFocus|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/hacode/|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=www.eyetap.org|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Notable researchers ==\n* [[Ivan Sutherland]] invented the [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|first VR head-mounted display]] at [[Harvard University]].\n* [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] formulated an earlier concept of [[mediated reality]] in the 1970s and 1980s, using cameras, processors, and display systems to modify visual reality to help people see better (dynamic range management), building computerized welding helmets, as well as \"augmediated reality\" vision systems for use in everyday life.

It is also intended to be linked with the user's smartphone to review footage, and control it separately. When successful, the lens would feature a camera, or sensor inside of it. It is said that it could be anything from a light sensor, to a temperature sensor.\n\nIn Augmented Reality, the distinction is made between two distinct modes of tracking, known as ''marker'' and ''[[Markerless motion capture|markerless]]''.

In the macular degeneration group, five out of eight subjects preferred the VRD images to the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) or paper images and thought they were better and brighter and were able to see equal or better resolution levels. The Keratoconus patients could all resolve smaller lines in several line tests using the VRD as opposed to their own correction. They also found the VRD images to be easier to view and sharper. As a result of these several tests, virtual retinal display is considered safe technology.\n\nVirtual retinal display creates images that can be seen in ambient daylight and ambient room light. The VRD is considered a preferred candidate to use in a surgical display due to its combination of high resolution and high contrast and brightness. Additional tests show high potential for VRD to be used as a display technology for patients that have low vision.\n\n=====EyeTap=====\n\nThe [[EyeTap]] (also known as Generation-2 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212812/http://wearcam.org/glass.pdf \"GlassEyes\": The Theory of EyeTap Digital Eye Glass, supplemental material for IEEE Technology and Society, Volume Vol. 31, Number 3, 2012, pp. 10\u201314].</ref>) captures rays of light that would otherwise pass through the center of the lens of the wearer's eye, and substitutes synthetic computer-controlled light for each ray of real light.\n\nThe Generation-4 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\" /> (Laser EyeTap) is similar to the VRD (i.e. it uses a computer-controlled laser light source) except that it also has infinite depth of focus and causes the eye itself to, in effect, function as both a camera and a display by way of exact alignment with the eye and resynthesis (in laser light) of rays of light entering the eye.<ref>\"Intelligent Image Processing\", [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-471-40637-6}}, 384 p.</ref>\n\n=====Handheld=====\n\nA Handheld display employs a small display that fits in a user's hand.

Handheld display AR promises to be the first commercial success for AR technologies. The two main advantages of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of camera phones.

SAR makes use of digital projectors to display graphical information onto physical objects. The key difference in SAR is that the display is separated from the users of the system. Since the displays are not associated with each user, SAR scales naturally up to groups of users, allowing for collocated collaboration between users.\n\nExamples include [[shader lamps]], mobile projectors, virtual tables, and smart projectors. Shader lamps mimic and augment reality by projecting imagery onto neutral objects. This provides the opportunity to enhance the object's appearance with materials of a simple unit\u2014a projector, camera, and sensor.\n\nOther applications include table and wall projections. One innovation, the Extended Virtual Table, separates the virtual from the real by including [[beam splitter|beam-splitter]] mirrors attached to the ceiling at an adjustable angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1162/105474601753272862|title = The Extended Virtual Table: An Optical Extension for Table-Like Projection Systems|journal = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume = 10|issue = 6|pages = 613\u2013631|year = 2001|last1 = Bimber|first1 = Oliver|last2 = Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o|first2 = L.

Some methods assume objects with known geometry (or fiducial markers) are present in the scene. In some of those cases the scene 3D structure should be calculated beforehand. If part of the scene is unknown simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can map relative positions. If no information about scene geometry is available, [[structure from motion]] methods like [[bundle adjustment]] are used.

Since AR systems rely heavily on the immersion of the user and the interaction between the user and the system, design can facilitate the adoption of virtuality. For most augmented reality systems, a similar design guideline can be followed. The following lists some considerations for designing augmented reality applications:\n\n====Environmental/context design====\n\nContext Design focuses on the end-user's physical surrounding, spatial space, and accessibility that may play a role when using the AR system. Designers should be aware of the possible physical scenarios the end-user may be in such as:\n* Public, in which the users use their whole body to interact with the software\n* Personal, in which the user uses a smartphone in a public space\n* Intimate, in which the user is sitting with a desktop and is not really moving\n* Private, in which the user has on a wearable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-principles-of-good-user-experience-design-for-augmented-reality-d8e22777aabd|title=\"The Principles of Good UX for Augmented Reality \u2013 UX Collective.\" UX Collective|last=Wilson|first=Tyler|date=30 January 2018|website=|access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy evaluating each physical scenario, potential safety hazards can be avoided and changes can be made to greater improve the end-user's immersion. [[User experience|UX designers]] will have to define user journeys for the relevant physical scenarios and define how the interface reacts to each.\n\nEspecially in AR systems, it is vital to also consider the spatial and surrounding elements that change the effectiveness of the AR technology. Environmental elements such as lighting and sound can prevent the AR device sensor from detecting necessary data and ruin the immersion of the end-user.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.igi-global.com/book/emerging-technologies-augmented-reality/338|title=Emerging Technologies of Augmented Reality: Interfaces and Design|last1=Haller|first1=Michael|last2=Billinghurst|first2=Mark|last3=Thomas|first3=Bruce|website=igi-global.com|access-date=|isbn=9781599040660|publisher=IGI Global|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of context design involves the design of the system's functionality and its ability to accommodate user preferences.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/google-vr/best-practices-mobile-ar-design/|title=Best Practices for Mobile AR Design- Google|date=13 December 2017|website=blog.google|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|title=Human Computer Interaction with Augmented Reality|website=eislab.fim.uni-passau.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525000513/http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While accessibility tools are common in basic application design, some consideration should be made when designing time-limited prompts (to prevent unintentional operations), audio cues and overall engagement time. It is important to note that in some situations, the application's functionality may hinder the user's ability. For example, applications that is used for driving should reduce the amount of user interaction and use audio cues instead.\n\n====Interaction design====\n\n[[Interaction design]] in augmented reality technology centers on the user's engagement with the end product to improve the overall user experience and enjoyment. The purpose of interaction design is to avoid alienating or confusing the user by organizing the information presented. Since user interaction relies on the user's input, designers must make system controls easier to understand and accessible. A common technique to improve usability for augmented reality applications is by discovering the frequently accessed areas in the device's touch display and design the application to match those areas of control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theblog.adobe.com/basic-patterns-of-mobile-navigation/|title=Basic Patterns of Mobile Navigation|date=9 May 2017|website=theblog.adobe.com|access-date=}}</ref> It is also important to structure the user journey maps and the flow of information presented which reduce the system's overall cognitive load and greatly improves the learning curve of the application.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|title=Principles of Mobile App Design: Engage Users and Drive Conversions|website=thinkwithgoogle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185621/https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn interaction design, it is important for developers to utilize augmented reality technology that complement the system's function or purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/inside-out-interaction-design-for-augmented-reality.php|title=Inside Out: Interaction Design for Augmented Reality-UXmatters|website=uxmatters.com|access-date=}}</ref> For instance, the utilization of exciting AR filters and the design of the unique sharing platform in [[Snapchat]] enables users to better the user's social interactions. In other applications that require users to understand the focus and intent, designers can employ a [[reticle]] or [[Ray casting|raycast]] from the device.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, augmented reality developers may find it appropriate to have digital elements scale or react to the direction of the camera and the context of objects that can are detected.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAugmented reality technology allows to utilize the introduction of [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]]. This means that a user can potentially access multiple copies of 2D interfaces within a single AR application.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n====Visual design====\n\nIn general, [[Visual design elements and principles|visual design]] is the appearance of the developing application that engages the user. To improve the graphic interface elements and user interaction, developers may use visual cues to inform the user what elements of UI are designed to interact with and how to interact with them. Since navigating in an AR application may appear difficult and seem frustrating, visual cue design can make interactions seem more natural.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn some augmented reality applications that use a 2D device as an interactive surface, the 2D control environment does not translate well in 3D space making users hesitant to explore their surroundings. To solve this issue, designers should apply visual cues to assist and encourage users to explore their surroundings.\n\nIt is important to note the two main objects in AR when developing VR applications: 3D [[volumetric]] objects that are manipulated and realistically interact with light and shadow; and animated media imagery such as images and videos which are mostly traditional 2D media rendered in a new context for augmented reality.<ref name=\":3\" /> When virtual objects are projected onto a real environment, it is challenging for augmented reality application designers to ensure a perfectly seamless integration relative to the real-world environment, especially with 2D objects. As such, designers can add weight to objects, use depths maps, and choose different material properties that highlight the object's presence in the real world. Another visual design that can be applied is using different [[computer graphics lighting|lighting]] techniques or casting shadows to improve overall depth judgment. For instance, a common lighting technique is simply placing a light source overhead at the 12&nbsp;o\u2019clock position, to create shadows on virtual objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Possible applications==\nAugmented reality has been explored for many applications, from gaming and entertainment to medicine, education and business. Example application areas described below include archaeology, architecture, commerce and education. Some of the earliest cited examples include augmented reality used to support surgery by providing virtual overlays to guide medical practitioners, to AR content for astronomy and welding.<ref name=\"Dupzyk 2016\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.slashgear.com/dont-be-blind-on-wearable-cameras-insists-ar-genius-20239514/|title=Don't be blind on wearable cameras insists AR genius|date=20 July 2012|work=SlashGear|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Archaeology===\nAR has been used to aid [[Archaeology|archaeological]] research.

Each user can collaborate by mutually \"navigating, searching, and viewing data\". Hrvoje Benko, a researcher in the computer science department at [[Columbia University]], points out that these particular systems and others like them can provide \"3D panoramic images and 3D models of the site itself at different excavation stages\" all the while organizing much of the data in a collaborative way that is easy to use. Collaborative AR systems supply [[multimodal interaction]]s that combine the real world with virtual images of both environments.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ISMAR.2004.23|chapter = Collaborative Mixed Reality Visualization of an Archaeological Excavation|title = Third IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality|pages = 132\u2013140|year = 2004|last1 = Benko|first1 = H.|last2 = Ishak|first2 = E.W.|last3 = Feiner|first3 = S.|isbn = 0-7695-2191-6|chapter-url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4835ffa05831617be3e0c36d306b0e0fc339f703}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nAR can aid in visualizing building projects. Computer-generated images of a structure can be superimposed onto a real-life local view of a property before the physical building is constructed there; this was demonstrated publicly by [[Trimble Navigation]] in 2004. AR can also be employed within an architect's workspace, rendering animated 3D visualizations of their 2D drawings. Architecture sight-seeing can be enhanced with AR applications, allowing users viewing a building's exterior to virtually see through its walls, viewing its interior objects and layout.<ref>Divecha, Devina.[http://www.designmena.com/inspiration/augmented-reality-ar-part-architecture-design Augmented Reality (AR) used in architecture and design].

A major difference between augmented reality and straightforward image recognition is that one can overlay multiple media at the same time in the view screen, such as social media share buttons, the in-page video even audio and 3D objects. Traditional print-only publications are using augmented reality to connect different types of media.<ref>Katts, Rima.

As an example, astronomical constellations and the movements of objects in the solar system were oriented in 3D and overlaid in the direction the device was held, and expanded with supplemental video information. Paper-based science book illustrations could seem to come alive as video without requiring the child to navigate to web-based materials.\n\nIn 2013, a project was launched on [[Kickstarter]] to teach about electronics with an educational toy that allowed children to scan their circuit with an iPad and see the electric current flowing around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://circuits.lightup.io/|title=LightUp - An award-winning toy that teaches kids about circuits and coding|website=LightUp|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110100/https://circuits.lightup.io/|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While some educational apps were available for AR by 2016, it was not broadly used.

The first was \"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\" by Gerald Baron.<ref name=\"BARO13\">\"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\", ''Emergency Management Magazine'', 24 September 2009</ref> According to Adam Crowe: \"Technologies like augmented reality (ex: Google Glass) and the growing expectation of the public will continue to force professional emergency managers to radically shift when, where, and how technology is deployed before, during, and after disasters.\"<ref name=\"CROW13\">\"What Does the Future Hold for Emergency Management?\", Emergency Management Magazine, 8 November 2013</ref>\n\nAnother early example was a search aircraft looking for a lost hiker in rugged mountain terrain. Augmented reality systems provided aerial camera operators with a geographic awareness of forest road names and locations blended with the camera video. The camera operator was better able to search for the hiker knowing the geographic context of the camera image. Once located, the operator could more efficiently direct rescuers to the hiker's location because the geographic position and reference landmarks were clearly labeled.<ref name=\"COOP07\">{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Joseph |title=Supporting Flight Control for UAV-Assisted Wilderness Search and Rescue Through Human Centered Interface Design |journal=Theses and Dissertations |date=15 November 2007 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1217/ }}</ref>\n\n===Social interaction===\nAR can be used to facilitate social interaction. An augmented reality social network framework called Talk2Me enables people to disseminate information and view others' advertised information in an augmented reality way. The timely and dynamic information sharing and viewing functionalities of Talk2Me help initiate conversations and make friends for users with people in physical proximity.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PERCOM.2018.8444578 |chapter=Talk2Me: A Framework for Device-to-Device Augmented Reality Social Network |title=2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Per ''Com'') |pages=1\u201310 |year=2018 |last1=Shu |first1=Jiayu |last2=Kosta |first2=Sokol |last3=Zheng |first3=Rui |last4=Hui |first4=Pan |isbn=978-1-5386-3224-6 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0de7cb3483a8d8f867e738250f16ba4f5efacc1f }}</ref> However, use of an AR headset can inhibit the quality of an interaction between two people if one isn't wearing one if the headset becomes a distraction. <ref>{{cite web |title=Effects of Augmented Reality on Social Interactions |url=https://www.electronicsdiary.com/2019/05/effects-of-augmented-reality-on-social.html |website=Electronics Diary}}</ref>\n\nAugmented reality also gives users the ability to practice different forms of social interactions with other people in a safe, risk-free environment. Hannes Kauffman, Associate Professor for Virtual Reality at TU [[Vienna]], says: \"In collaborative Augmented Reality multiple users may access a shared space populated by virtual objects, while remaining grounded in the real world. This technique is particularly powerful for educational purposes when users are collocated and can use natural means of communication (speech, gestures, etc.), but can also be mixed successfully with immersive VR or remote collaboration.\"{{cite quote|date=October 2019}} Hannes cites [[education]] as a potential use of this technology.\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|List of augmented reality software#Games|l1=List of augmented reality software \u00a7 Games}}\n[[File:Desjardins AR Augmented Reality Game, March 2013.png|thumb|upright|alt= An image from an AR mobile game | An AR mobile game using a trigger image as [[fiducial marker]]]]\n\nThe gaming industry embraced AR technology.

In their 1993 paper \"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\" the authors describe the use of map overlays applied to video from space surveillance telescopes. The map overlays indicated the trajectories of various objects in geographic coordinates. This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify and catalog potentially dangerous space debris.<ref name=\"ABER93\">Abernathy, M., Houchard, J., Puccetti, M., and Lambert, J,\"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\", Proceedings of 1993 Space Surveillance Workshop 30 March to 1 April 1993, pages 189-195</ref>\n\nStarting in 2003 the US Army integrated the SmartCam3D augmented reality system into the Shadow Unmanned Aerial System to aid sensor operators using telescopic cameras to locate people or points of interest. The system combined fixed geographic information including street names, points of interest, airports, and railroads with live video from the camera system. The system offered a \"picture in picture\" mode that allows it to show a synthetic view of the area surrounding the camera's field of view. This helps solve a problem in which the field of view is so narrow that it excludes important context, as if \"looking through a soda straw\". The system displays real-time friend/foe/neutral location markers blended with live video, providing the operator with improved situational awareness.\n\nAs of 2010, Korean researchers are looking to implement mine-detecting robots into the military. The proposed design for such a robot includes a mobile platform that is like a track which would be able to cover uneven distances including stairs. The robot's mine detection sensor would include a combination of metal detectors and [[Ground-penetrating radar]] to locate mines or [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. This unique design would be immeasurably helpful in saving lives of Korean soldiers.<ref name=\"Kang 2010\">{{cite proceedings |last1=Kang |first1=Seong Pal|last2=Choi|first2=Junho|last3=Suh|first3=Seung-Beum|last4=Kang|first4=Sungchul |title=Design of mine detection robot for Korean mine field |journal=2010 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts |date=October 2010 |pages=53\u201356 |doi=10.1109/ARSO.2010.5679622}}</ref>\n\nResearchers at USAF Research Lab (Calhoun, Draper et al.) found an approximately two-fold increase in the speed at which UAV sensor operators found points of interest using this technology.<ref name=\"CALH05\">Calhoun, G.

It has now become common in weather casting to display full motion video of images captured in real-time from multiple cameras and other imaging devices. Coupled with 3D graphics symbols and mapped to a common virtual geospatial model, these animated visualizations constitute the first true application of AR to TV.\n\nAR has become common in sports telecasting. Sports and entertainment venues are provided with see-through and overlay augmentation through tracked camera feeds for enhanced viewing by the audience. Examples include the yellow \"[[first down]]\" line seen in television broadcasts of [[American football]] games showing the line the offensive team must cross to receive a first down. AR is also used in association with football and other sporting events to show commercial advertisements overlaid onto the view of the playing area. Sections of [[rugby football|rugby]] fields and [[cricket]] pitches also display sponsored images. Swimming telecasts often add a line across the lanes to indicate the position of the current record holder as a race proceeds to allow viewers to compare the current race to the best performance. Other examples include hockey puck tracking and annotations of racing car performance and snooker ball trajectories.<ref name=\"recentadvances\">Azuma, Ronald; Balliot, Yohan; Behringer, Reinhold; Feiner, Steven; Julier, Simon; MacIntyre, Blair.

In September 2017, Snapchat updated its app to include a camera filter that allowed users to render an animated, cartoon version of themselves called \"[[Bitmoji]]\". These animated avatars would be projected in the real world through the camera, and can be photographed or video recorded.<ref>Wagner, Kurt. \"Snapchat's New Augmented Reality Feature Brings Your Cartoon Bitmoji into the Real World.\" Recode, Recode, 14 Sept. 2017, www.recode.net/2017/9/14/16305890/snapchat-bitmoji-ar-Facebook.</ref> In the same month, Snapchat also announced a new feature called \"Sky Filters\" that will be available on its app. This new feature makes use of augmented reality to alter the look of a picture taken of the sky, much like how users can apply the app's filters to other pictures. Users can choose from sky filters such as starry night, stormy clouds, beautiful sunsets, and rainbow.<ref>Miller, Chance. \"Snapchat's Latest Augmented Reality Feature Lets You Paint the Sky with New Filters.\" 9to5Mac, 9to5Mac, 25 Sept. 2017, 9to5mac.com/2017/09/25/how-to-use-snapchat-sky-filters/.</ref>\n\n==The dangers of AR==\n\n===Reality modifications===\nIn a paper titled \"Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO\u201d, researchers at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management claim the game caused \"a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called Pok\u00e9Stops, where users can play the game while driving.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Faccio |first1=Mara |last2=McConnell |first2=John J. |title=Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO |date=2017 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3073723 |ssrn=3073723 }}</ref> Using data from one municipality, the paper extrapolates what that might mean nationwide and concluded \"the increase in crashes attributable to the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon GO is 145,632 with an associated increase in the number of injuries of 29,370 and an associated increase in the number of fatalities of 256 over the period of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 2016.\" The authors extrapolated the cost of those crashes and fatalities at between $2bn and $7.3 billion for the same period. Furthermore, more than one in three surveyed advanced Internet users would like to edit out disturbing elements around them, such as garbage or graffiti.<ref>Peddie, J., 2017, Agumented Reality, Springer{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> They would like to even modify their surroundings by erasing street signs, billboard ads, and uninteresting shopping windows. So it seems that AR is as much a threat to companies as it is an opportunity. Although, this could be a nightmare to numerous brands that do not manage to capture consumer imaginations it also creates the risk that the wearers of augmented reality glasses may become unaware of surrounding dangers. Consumers want to use augmented reality glasses to change their surroundings into something that reflects their own personal opinions. Around two in five want to change the way their surroundings look and even how people appear to them.\n\nNext, to the possible privacy issues that are described below, overload and over-reliance issues are the biggest danger of AR. For the development of new AR-related products, this implies that the user-interface should follow certain guidelines as not to overload the user with information while also preventing the user from over-relying on the AR system such that important cues from the environment are missed.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Azuma |first1=Ronald T. |title=A Survey of Augmented Reality |journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments |date=August 1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=355\u2013385 |doi=10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355 |citeseerx=10.1.1.35.5387 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fdc075d1cc14d64c11c3c860e86a082b761f4a0 }}</ref> This is called the virtually-augmented key.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\"/> Once the key is ignored, people might not desire the real world anymore.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\nThe concept of modern augmented reality depends on the ability of the device to record and analyze the environment in real time. Because of this, there are potential legal concerns over privacy. While the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] allows for such recording in the name of public interest, the constant recording of an AR device makes it difficult to do so without also recording outside of the public domain. Legal complications would be found in areas where a right to a certain amount of privacy is expected or where copyrighted media are displayed.\n\nIn terms of individual privacy, there exists the ease of access to information that one should not readily possess about a given person. This is accomplished through facial recognition technology. Assuming that AR automatically passes information about persons that the user sees, there could be anything seen from social media, criminal record, and marital status.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1145/2638728.2641709 |chapter=Augmented reality |title=Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing Adjunct Publication - UbiComp '14 Adjunct |pages=1283\u20131288 |year=2014 |last1=Roesner |first1=Franziska |last2=Kohno |first2=Tadayoshi |last3=Denning |first3=Tamara |last4=Calo |first4=Ryan |last5=Newell |first5=Bryce Clayton |isbn=978-1-4503-3047-3 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9acde5d5b02484f4296712c522fb2bf0024eafbe }}</ref>\n\nThe Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation, which was originally introduced by [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] in 2004 and further refined with [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Marvin Minsky]] in 2013, was ultimately ratified at the Virtual Reality Toronto conference on June 25, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ebrary.net/123089/sociology/code_ethics_human_augmentation|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation - Augmented Reality : Where We Will All Live -|website=m.ebrary.net|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-future-of-tech-just-c_b_10929608|title=The Future of Tech Just Changed at VRTO--Here's Why That Matters to You|last=Damiani|first=Jesse|last2=|first2=|date=2016-07-18|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2016/07/vrto-spearheads-code-of-ethics-on-human-augmentation/|title=VRTO Spearheads Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=VRFocus|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/hacode/|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=www.eyetap.org|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Notable researchers ==\n* [[Ivan Sutherland]] invented the [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|first VR head-mounted display]] at [[Harvard University]].\n* [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] formulated an earlier concept of [[mediated reality]] in the 1970s and 1980s, using cameras, processors, and display systems to modify visual reality to help people see better (dynamic range management), building computerized welding helmets, as well as \"augmediated reality\" vision systems for use in everyday life.
