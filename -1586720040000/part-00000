It lies on the [[North Sea]] coast of England, {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} from [[Colchester]] and full of Wooly Woofters. It was constructed in the 1930s as a [[Seaside resort|holiday resort]] for Londoners, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\nThe land on which the village is built was originally fields and [[salt marsh]] and unsuitable for agriculture. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to build low cost, affordable holiday homes for working-class families, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the [[Second World War]], a shortage of housing meant the properties became permanently inhabited despite not being built for this purpose. The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere. Many holiday homes are now in a state of disrepair. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Martello Tower, Near Jaywick, Clacton-on-Sea - geograph.org.uk - 12378.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jaywick Martello Tower|Martello Tower]], now an arts centre]]\nJaywick is around {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} southeast of [[Colchester]].<ref name=\"usborne\"/><ref name=\"ramesh\"/> It in the Golf Green ward of the Tendring district of north-east Essex.<ref name=\"tendringbg\">{{cite report|url=http://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/business/regeneration/jaywick/Jaywick%20Background%20for%20website.pdf|title=Jaywick \u2013 Background|publisher=Tendring District Council|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=depriv>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1871208.pdf|title=The English Indices of Deprivation 2010|date=24 March 2011|publisher=[[Department of Communities and Local Government]]|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> To the north-east is Clacton-on-Sea (from which it is separated by Clacton Airfield), while to the west is the estuary of the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]].

It lies on the [[North Sea]] coast of England, {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} from [[Colchester]]. It was constructed in the 1930s as a [[Seaside resort|holiday resort]] for Londoners, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\nThe land on which the village is built was originally fields and [[salt marsh]] and unsuitable for agriculture. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to build low cost, affordable holiday homes for working-class families, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the [[Second World War]], a shortage of housing meant the properties became permanently inhabited despite not being built for this purpose. The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere. Many holiday homes are now in a state of disrepair.
