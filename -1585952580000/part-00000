Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror.

[[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen.

Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies, often at high prices and on credit, from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''. Last updated September 27, 2004.</ref> By 1896, dolls, stoves, and groceries had been added to the catalog.\n\n[[File: Sears Merchandise Building Tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The exterior of the [[Sears Merchandise Building Tower]]]]\nDespite the strong and growing sales, the national [[Panic of 1893]] led to a full-scale [[recession]], causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jack, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today).

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973 when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jack, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had over-expanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]], [[Diehard (type of battery)|DieHard]], [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]], [[Supertone Records|Supertone]], and [[Toughskins]]. The company became a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] during the mid-20th century, adding [[Dean Witter]] and [[Coldwell Banker]] real estate in 1981, starting [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] as a joint venture with [[IBM]] in 1984, and introducing the [[Discover Card|Discover credit card]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, Sears completed the 110-story [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in Chicago, which became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|world's tallest building]], a title it took from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York.

The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. This was before the internet became an effective tool. With the advantage of hindsight, the timing was poor; Sears already had in place what it took [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] years to achieve.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nSears eventually held sales on all items.

Specifically, in return, Sears Roebuck became \"one of the largest shareholders\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations. More precisely, the existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the [[Puerto Rico|Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]].\n\nIn 1997 Sears sold 85% of [[Sears (Mexico)|its Mexico affiliate]] to [[Grupo Carso]].

It sponsored the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series|Truck Series]], using the Craftsman brand as the title sponsor, from the series' inception in the [[1995 NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman]] to the [[2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2008 season]], when the agreement ended.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/news/breaking_news/story/388059.html \"Craftsman Dropping Sponsorship of NASCAR Truck Series\"]. ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. December 4, 2007.</ref> Craftsman tools remain the official tools of NASCAR. The company sponsored the television series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''. It sponsors and currently has naming rights to the [[Sears Centre]], an 11,000-seat multi-purpose family entertainment, cultural and sports center, constructed in 2006 in Hoffman Estates. The company also underwrote the [[PBS]] television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', under the name The Sears-Roebuck Foundation from the show's premiere in 1968 until 1992. It sponsored the #10 [[Gillett Evernham Motorsports]] car of Scott Riggs for the September 2, 2007, running of the [[Sharp AQUOS 500]] at [[California Speedway]] through its Sears Auto Center branch. However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event.\nIn 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woosprint.com/sponsors|title=World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series \u2013 Sponsors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Employee relations==\n[[File:Sears Centro Historico.jpg|thumb|Sears building in the [[Edificio La Nacional]] building in Mexico City, across from the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].]]\nSears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%. As of 2017, appliances is the only remaining department where compensation is based entirely on commission. Other departments give a base pay plus commission. In many stores, jewelry department associates receive a low base salary with 1% commission on their sales.\n\nIn March 2019, Sears claimed that it was ending life insurance benefits for an undisclosed number of its 90,000 retirees. A few months earlier the company handed out over $25 million in bonuses to executives.<ref>{{cite news |last= Folley|first=Aris|date=March 30, 2019|title=Sears cutting life insurance benefits for up to 90,000 retirees: report|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/436593-sears-cuts-life-insurance-benefits-for-up-to-90000-retirees|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|location= |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> This key Sears Retiree Benefit was worth between $5,000 and $15,000 for most of the pool (29,000) of eligible retired employees.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mooney|first=John|date=July 30, 2019|title=Sears Retiree Benefit|url=https://choiceseniorlife.com/2019/07/what-do-you-do-when-sears-cancels-your-life-insurance-policy/ |website=ChoiceSeniorLife.com}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2019, former Sears Holdings chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/business/sears-severance/index.html|title=Sears' owner wants to get out of paying $43 million in severance to former employees|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-fears-eddie-lampert-would-wipe-out-sears-pension-plans|title=Government fears Eddie Lampert would wipe out Sears' pension plans|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref> A ''[[Forbes]]'' editorial pointed out that [[Steven Mnuchin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]], was a board member of Sears Holding until 2016, and is presently one of three directors of the [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], which manages administration of pensions for defunct or bankrupt businesses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2019/06/03/the-shameless-sears-world-of-eddie-lampert-continues/#296430171fd6/|title=The Shameless Sears World Of Eddie Lampert Continues|last=|first=|date=June 3, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"50\">\nFile:Sears, Robuck & Co. letterhead 1907.jpg|Letterhead logo 1907\nFile:Sears logo 1966-1984.svg|Logo 1963\u201384\nFile:Sears1984.png|1984\u201394\nFile:Sears logo 1994-2004.svg|1994\u20132004 (still used in [[Sears Mexico|Mexico]])\nFile:SearsLogo.svg|2004\u201310 (2004\u201316 in Canada)\nFile:Sears logo 2010-present.svg|2010\u201320\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile: Sears Auto Center.jpg|Sears Auto Center at [[Steeplegate Mall]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]].

Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies, often at high prices and on credit, from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''. Last updated September 27, 2004.</ref> By 1896, dolls, stoves, and groceries had been added to the catalog.\n\n[[File: Sears Merchandise Building Tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The exterior of the [[Sears Merchandise Building Tower]]]]\nDespite the strong and growing sales, the national [[Panic of 1893]] led to a full-scale [[recession]], causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jack, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). They had to incorporate a new company in order to bring the operation public; Sears and Rosenwald established '''Sears, Roebuck and Company''' with the legal name '''Sears, Roebuck and Co.''', in the state of New York, which effectively replaced the original company.<ref>https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042417/https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 |date=December 1, 2017}} Sears, Roebuck and Company (Co.) 1906 New York incorporation</ref> The current company inherits the history of the old company, celebrating the original 1892 incorporation, rather than the 1906 revision, as the start of the company.\n\nSears' successful 1906 [[initial public offering]] (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector.<ref>Gregory D.

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973 when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jack, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had over-expanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]], [[Diehard (type of battery)|DieHard]], [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]], [[Supertone Records|Supertone]], and [[Toughskins]]. The company became a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] during the mid-20th century, adding [[Dean Witter]] and [[Coldwell Banker]] real estate in 1981, starting [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] as a joint venture with [[IBM]] in 1984, and introducing the [[Discover Card|Discover credit card]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, Sears completed the 110-story [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in Chicago, which became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|world's tallest building]], a title it took from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York.

In March 2009 London-based insurer [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis Group Holdings, Ltd.]], was given the building's naming rights to encourage them to occupy the building. The official renaming as the ''Willis Tower'' took place on Thursday, July 16, 2009, during a public ceremony hosted by Willis Group Holdings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE52B54J20090312 |title=Tallest U.S. building to get new name |work=Reuters |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Conlon}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, the company began divesting itself of many non-retail entities, which were detrimental to the company's bottom line. Sears spun off its financial services arm which included brokerage business Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card.

Katz, ''The Big Store'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe cost of distributing the once highly influential general merchandise catalog became prohibitive; sales and profits had declined. The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. This was before the internet became an effective tool. With the advantage of hindsight, the timing was poor; Sears already had in place what it took [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] years to achieve.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nSears eventually held sales on all items. The dedicated customer would just wait until the item was on sale to buy. In the meantime, the item took up valuable floor space. This was a marketing policy misjudgment.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nAfter weeks of speculation in 1998, Sears announced it had sold the remnants of Western Auto to [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]-based [[Advance Auto Parts]]. The business deal was not quite what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically, in return, Sears Roebuck became \"one of the largest shareholders\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations.

One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%.

It was directed by [[Bryan Singer]] from a screenplay by [[Anthony McCarten]], and produced by [[Graham King]] and Queen manager [[Jim Beach]]. It stars [[Rami Malek]] as Mercury, with [[Lucy Boynton]], [[Gwilym Lee]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]], [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Allen Leech]], and [[Mike Myers]] in supporting roles. Queen members [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by [[20th Century Fox]], [[Regency Enterprises]], [[GK Films]], and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the singer's life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 [[Live Aid]] performance at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' was announced in 2010, with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] set to play Mercury. After he left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before Malek was cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of [[principal photography]], which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and crew. [[Dexter Fletcher]], who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per [[Directors Guild of America]] guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of Mercury's sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise.<!-- SEE TALK PAGE before changing this sourced text. --><ref name=varietyreview>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bohemian-rhapsody-critics-reviews-roundup-rami-malek-1202990633/|title='Bohemian Rhapsody' Sees Mixed Reviews as Critics Praise Rami Malek|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Yang|first=Rachel|date=23 October 2018|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2018/11/07/rhapsody-addresses-freddie-mercurys-sexuality/38437035/|title=How 'Rhapsody' addresses Freddie Mercury's sexuality|website=[[The Detroit News]]|last=Sblendorio|first=Peter|date=7 November 2018|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies.<ref name=\"greene\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/freddie-mercury-queen-biopic-bohemian-rhapsody-movie-fact-check-746195/|title=Fact-Checking the Queen Biopic, 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=1 November 2018|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> It became a major box office success, grossing over {{US$|903&nbsp;million|long=no}} worldwide on a production budget of about {{US$|50&nbsp;million|long=no}}, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide]] and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Queen biopic surpasses $900m at box office |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47939549 |accessdate=15 April 2019 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' received [[List of accolades received by Bohemian Rhapsody|numerous accolades]], including a leading four wins at the [[91st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Malek), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]; it was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

After seeing the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]] perform \"[[Doing All Right]]\" at a pub, Farrokh encounters and is attracted to Mary Austin, and meets the band's drummer, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], and guitarist, [[Brian May]], who inform him that their lead singer/bass guitarist, [[Tim Staffell]], has quit. Farrokh, who has followed the band for some time, asks to join them. He impresses Taylor and May with his vocal ability, and they let him in the band. Farrokh and Mary begin dating. With Farrokh as lead singer and [[John Deacon]] on bass, the band sells out gigs across Britain. Farrokh urges his bandmates to think bigger and they sell their tour van to book [[Trident Studios]]<ref>Depicted by the orange Trident Studios logos on tape recorders and plaques on Record Awards on wall.</ref> to record their [[Queen (Queen album)|debut album]]. An [[A&R]] rep from [[EMI Records]], watching the band experiment, asks studio engineer [[Roy Thomas Baker]] for their demos. Farrokh changes the band's name to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and legally changes his own name to [[Freddie Mercury]].\n\nThe band signs with [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], [[Elton John]]'s manager, and receives a contract with EMI. An appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helps \"[[Killer Queen]]\" become a hit record. After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the charts in America and the band embarks on a sold-out U.S. tour, where Freddie begins to question his sexuality. In 1975, Queen records their fourth album, ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]],'' with its centerpiece, \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". Despite the effort put into writing and recording it, EMI executive Ray Foster refuses to release the song as the album's [[lead single]] due to its six-minute length. After Foster further derides the song's lyrics and operatics, Freddie retaliates by throwing a rock through Foster's window and cursing at him, to which Foster responds in kind. Freddie conspires with DJ [[Kenny Everett]] to debut the song on the radio, forcing the record company to release it as a single. Despite mixed reviews, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" becomes a smash hit. Freddie begins an affair with the band's day-to-day manager, Paul Prenter, during Queen's [[A Night at the Opera Tour|world tour]]. Confronted by Mary, Freddie comes out to her as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], but she assures him that he is gay. They end their engagement but remain friends, and she moves next door after he purchases an extravagant house in 1980.\n\nAs Freddie sinks into debauchery with the manipulative Paul, tensions arise in the band. After throwing a lavish party, Freddie gropes a waiter, Jim Hutton, who is offended. Freddie apologises and the two connect and share a kiss. Jim tells Freddie to find him when Freddie learns to like himself. Following a successful show at [[Madison Square Garden]], performing their latest hit \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", Paul suggests to Reid that Freddie is growing dissatisfied with the band, and could make better money by going solo, like [[Michael Jackson]] did. Reid proposes a solo career to Freddie, and Paul feigns ignorance, leading an enraged Freddie to fire Reid without consulting the band, furthering their strain. Freddie's (and Paul's) desire for Queen to branch out into disco and club music creates additional conflict with the band, although John Deacon writes a bass riff with a rock-disco beat that leads to their next hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\".\n\nAt a [[press conference]] promoting Queen's 1982 album ''[[Hot Space]]'', Freddie becomes hostile when he is bombarded with questions about his personal life. Freddie's relationship with his bandmates further sours after their music video for \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\", in which the band appears in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], is banned from [[MTV]] and he announces his desire to temporarily separate. He reveals his $4&nbsp;million solo deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], and the band feels betrayed. In 1984, Freddie moves to [[Munich]] to work on his first solo album, ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'', but abuses drugs and alcohol and participates in [[Orgy|orgies]] with Paul. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and concerned about Freddie, arrives unannounced and urges him to return to the band and perform at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[benefit concert]], [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Realizing that Paul withheld news of the concert in order to control Freddie, Freddie fires him. Paul retaliates by going public about Freddie's sexual escapades.\n\nFreddie returns to London to reconcile with his bandmates and agrees that hereafter their songs will be credited to Queen as a whole. He appeals to them to participate in Live Aid and they are given a last-minute slot. With [[HIV/AIDS]] spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he has contracted the virus. During a rehearsal he reveals this to the band, who are shocked and saddened, but Freddie says that pitying him is only a waste of time, and makes them promise not to say anything in order to keep the likely media frenzy from overshadowing their music. On the day of Live Aid, Freddie reconnects with Jim, introduces him to his family, and brings him to Live Aid. Mary, her husband, and Jim watch from the wings as Queen perform \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", and \"[[We Are the Champions]].\" Donations to the charity increase and the event turns into a massive success. The film ends with a series of title cards stating that Freddie died on 24 November 1991 at aged 45 from [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|AIDS-related pneumonia]]; he remained close with Jim for the rest of his life; \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released and hit number one again; and that the [[Mercury Phoenix Trust]] was founded in his honour to help those living with AIDS.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody cast on MTV Movies.jpg|thumb|(Left to right) Joe Mazzello, Rami Malek, and Gwilym Lee promoting the film in 2018.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rami Malek]] as [[Freddie Mercury]], lead vocalist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/rami-malek-mr-robot-freddie-mercury-queen-biopic|title=Mr Robot star Rami Malek to play Freddie Mercury in Queen biopic|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Lucy Boynton]] as Mary Austin, Mercury's girlfriend, former fianc\u00e9e, and muse<ref name=\"BoyntonCast\" />\n* [[Gwilym Lee]] as [[Brian May]], Queen's lead guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Queen's drummer<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]] as [[John Deacon]], Queen's bass guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], Queen's manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aidan-gillen-tom-hollander-join-cast-bohemian-rhapsody-1043083|title=Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander Join Cast of Queen Biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|date=26 September 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Allen Leech]] as Paul Prenter, Mercury's personal manager and lover<ref name=\"LeechCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as [[Jim Beach|Jim \"Miami\" Beach]], Queen's lawyer turned manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\" />\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Ray Foster, an [[EMI]] executive<ref name=\"MyersCast\"/>\n* [[Aaron McCusker]] as Jim Hutton, Mercury's boyfriend<ref name=\"McCuskerCast\"/>\n* Meneka Das as Jer Bulsara, Mercury's mother\n* [[Ace Bhatti]] as Bomi Bulsara, Mercury's father\n* Priya Blackburn as Kashmira Bulsara, Mercury's sister\n* [[Tim Plester]] as [[Roy Thomas Baker]], Queen's sound engineer\n* [[Dermot Murphy (actor)|Dermot Murphy]] as [[Bob Geldof]], [[Live Aid]] organizer\n* Dickie Beau as [[Kenny Everett]], radio broadcaster from [[Capital London]], [[BBC Radio 1]], and [[BBC Radio 2]]\n* Jack Roth as [[Tim Staffell]], vocalist & bassist of the rock band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]\n* [[Max Bennett (actor)|Max Bennett]] as David, Mary's new boyfriend\n* Neil Fox-Roberts as Mr. Austin, Mary's father\n* [[Michelle Duncan]] as Shelley Stern, a reporter\n* [[Adam Lambert]] as Truck Stop Guy (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/adam-lambert-bohemian-rhapsody-cameo-appearance-trucker-freddie-mercury-rami-malek-1202533733/|title=Adam Lambert Confirms Disguised 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Cameo|first1=Greg|last1=Evans|first2=Greg|last2=Evans|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n* Luke Deacon (John Deacon's son) as concert attendee (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web |last1=QueenZone.com |title=Bohemian Rhapsody movie cameos (... and other weird bits) ReplyNew TopicNew PollSearch |url=http://www.queenzone.com/forums/1537030/bohemian-rhapsody-movie-cameos-and-other-weird-bits.aspx |website=Queen Zone |accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nPlans for a film about Queen were revealed in September 2010 by the band's guitarist [[Brian May]].

It was directed by [[Bryan Singer]] from a screenplay by [[Anthony McCarten]], and produced by [[Graham King]] and Queen manager [[Jim Beach]]. It stars [[Rami Malek]] as Mercury, with [[Lucy Boynton]], [[Gwilym Lee]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]], [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Allen Leech]], and [[Mike Myers]] in supporting roles. Queen members [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by [[20th Century Fox]], [[Regency Enterprises]], [[GK Films]], and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the singer's life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 [[Live Aid]] performance at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' was announced in 2010, with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] set to play Mercury. After he left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before Malek was cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of [[principal photography]], which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and crew. [[Dexter Fletcher]], who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per [[Directors Guild of America]] guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of Mercury's sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise.<!-- SEE TALK PAGE before changing this sourced text. --><ref name=varietyreview>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bohemian-rhapsody-critics-reviews-roundup-rami-malek-1202990633/|title='Bohemian Rhapsody' Sees Mixed Reviews as Critics Praise Rami Malek|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Yang|first=Rachel|date=23 October 2018|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2018/11/07/rhapsody-addresses-freddie-mercurys-sexuality/38437035/|title=How 'Rhapsody' addresses Freddie Mercury's sexuality|website=[[The Detroit News]]|last=Sblendorio|first=Peter|date=7 November 2018|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies.<ref name=\"greene\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/freddie-mercury-queen-biopic-bohemian-rhapsody-movie-fact-check-746195/|title=Fact-Checking the Queen Biopic, 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=1 November 2018|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> It became a major box office success, grossing over {{US$|903&nbsp;million|long=no}} worldwide on a production budget of about {{US$|50&nbsp;million|long=no}}, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide]] and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Queen biopic surpasses $900m at box office |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47939549 |accessdate=15 April 2019 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' received [[List of accolades received by Bohemian Rhapsody|numerous accolades]], including a leading four wins at the [[91st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Malek), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]; it was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

After seeing the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]] perform \"[[Doing All Right]]\" at a pub, Farrokh encounters and is attracted to Mary Austin, and meets the band's drummer, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], and guitarist, [[Brian May]], who inform him that their lead singer/bass guitarist, [[Tim Staffell]], has quit. Farrokh, who has followed the band for some time, asks to join them. He impresses Taylor and May with his vocal ability, and they let him in the band. Farrokh and Mary begin dating. With Farrokh as lead singer and [[John Deacon]] on bass, the band sells out gigs across Britain. Farrokh urges his bandmates to think bigger and they sell their tour van to book [[Trident Studios]]<ref>Depicted by the orange Trident Studios logos on tape recorders and plaques on Record Awards on wall.</ref> to record their [[Queen (Queen album)|debut album]]. An A&R rep from [[EMI Records]], watching the band experiment, asks studio engineer [[Roy Thomas Baker]] for their demos. Farrokh changes the band's name to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and legally changes his own name to [[Freddie Mercury]].\n\nThe band signs with [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], [[Elton John]]'s manager, and receives a contract with EMI. An appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helps \"[[Killer Queen]]\" become a hit record. After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the charts in America and the band embarks on a sold-out U.S. tour, where Freddie begins to question his sexuality. In 1975, Queen records their fourth album, ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]],'' with its centerpiece, \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". Despite the effort put into writing and recording it, EMI executive Ray Foster refuses to release the song as the album's [[lead single]] due to its six-minute length. After Foster further derides the song's lyrics and operatics, Freddie retaliates by throwing a rock through Foster's window and cursing at him, to which Foster responds in kind. Freddie conspires with DJ [[Kenny Everett]] to debut the song on the radio, forcing the record company to release it as a single. Despite mixed reviews, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" becomes a smash hit. Freddie begins an affair with the band's day-to-day manager, Paul Prenter, during Queen's [[A Night at the Opera Tour|world tour]]. Confronted by Mary, Freddie comes out to her as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], but she assures him that he is gay. They end their engagement but remain friends, and she moves next door after he purchases an extravagant house in 1980.\n\nAs Freddie sinks into debauchery with the manipulative Paul, tensions arise in the band. After throwing a lavish party, Freddie gropes a waiter, Jim Hutton, who is offended. Freddie apologises and the two connect and share a kiss. Jim tells Freddie to find him when Freddie learns to like himself. Following a successful show at [[Madison Square Garden]], performing their latest hit \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", Paul suggests to Reid that Freddie is growing dissatisfied with the band, and could make better money by going solo, like [[Michael Jackson]] did. Reid proposes a solo career to Freddie, and Paul feigns ignorance, leading an enraged Freddie to fire Reid without consulting the band, furthering their strain. Freddie's (and Paul's) desire for Queen to branch out into disco and club music creates additional conflict with the band, although John Deacon writes a bass riff with a rock-disco beat that leads to their next hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\".\n\nAt a [[press conference]] promoting Queen's 1982 album ''[[Hot Space]]'', Freddie becomes hostile when he is bombarded with questions about his personal life. Freddie's relationship with his bandmates further sours after their music video for \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\", in which the band appears in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], is banned from [[MTV]] and he announces his desire to temporarily separate. He reveals his $4&nbsp;million solo deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], and the band feels betrayed. In 1984, Freddie moves to [[Munich]] to work on his first solo album, ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'', but abuses drugs and alcohol and participates in [[Orgy|orgies]] with Paul. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and concerned about Freddie, arrives unannounced and urges him to return to the band and perform at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[benefit concert]], [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Realizing that Paul withheld news of the concert in order to control Freddie, Freddie fires him. Paul retaliates by going public about Freddie's sexual escapades.\n\nFreddie returns to London to reconcile with his bandmates and agrees that hereafter their songs will be credited to Queen as a whole. He appeals to them to participate in Live Aid and they are given a last-minute slot. With [[HIV/AIDS]] spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he has contracted the virus. During a rehearsal he reveals this to the band, who are shocked and saddened, but Freddie says that pitying him is only a waste of time, and makes them promise not to say anything in order to keep the likely media frenzy from overshadowing their music.

It was actually taken from the [[Marx Brothers]] [[A Night at the Opera (film)|film of the same name]].\n* The character of Ray Foster is fictional and loosely based on EMI chief Roy Featherstone. While Featherstone and others did think that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was too long to be released as a single, Featherstone was a fan of the band. In addition, Queen released numerous more albums and singles with EMI.<ref name=\"greene\"/>\n*[[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] wasn't fired as Queen's manager after an argument with Mercury over his solo career as portrayed in the film.

May had released the EP ''[[Star Fleet Project]]'' in October 1983. Granted, this is never claimed in the film, though it's perceived as an implication.\n* Queen never split up, so Live Aid was not a reunion. They released the album ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'' in early 1984 and then [[The Works Tour|toured worldwide]]. The last show of the tour was eight weeks before Live Aid. They were \"extremely well-rehearsed\" for the show and did not have to get back into shape as a band. They were also not a last-minute addition to the concert.<ref name=\"greene\"/> \n* The theatrical release of the film depicts Queen performing \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" and \" [[We Are the Champions]]\" at Live Aid. In reality, the performance included \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\" and \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" before the latter song. The cast recreated the performances of these songs, but they were edited from the theatrical version of the film. \"Radio Ga Ga\" and \"Hammer to Fall\" were also shortened through editing.\n*The Rio de Janeiro concert, depicted in the movie as taking place circa 1979, was actually held during the first Rock In Rio festival, in January 1985 (thus approximately six months before the Live Aid performance);<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/galleries/bohemian-rhapsody-behind-the-scenes/|title=Bohemian Rhapsody: The Untold Stories Behind the Freddie Mercury Biopic|last=Smith|first=Greg|date=2019-07-27|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> the live version for \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" used in the movie scene is taken from the 1985 Rio concert, and labeled as such in the accompanying official soundtrack for the film.\n*In a scene that didn't appear in the actual film but was briefly shown in a trailer, [[Gwilym Lee]] as Brian May and [[Joe Mazzello]] as John Deacon are seen [[Bowed guitar|playing their guitars with a bow]], which May himself claims to have never done.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvhn.nl/extra/Movie-mistakes-in-Bohemian-Rhapsody-17-facts-the-Queen-biopic-got-totally-wrong-23809088.html|title=Movie mistakes in Bohemian Rhapsody: 17 facts the Queen biopic got totally wrong|website=toestemming.ndcmediagroep.nl|url-status=live|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n*Some songs are shown out of chronological order.

Both May and Taylor have supported the view that Prenter's partnership with Mercury was a source of friction within Queen. May stated in his book ''Queen 3-D'' that \"He [Prenter] was certainly responsible for leading Freddie off on a different path, and it would be fair to say that we parted on terms that were less than good\" while Taylor revealed in the Queen documentary ''Days of our Lives'' that \"He was a very, very bad influence upon Freddie, hence on the band, really.\"<ref name=\"ultimateclassicrock.com\"/> However, Prenter's family have disputed the film's depiction of his and Mercury's relationship, stating that Prenter did not hide details of the ''Live Aid'' concert from Mercury and that he parted company with the band after ''Live Aid'' had been held.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/family-of-belfast-man-prenter-who-was-freddie-mercurys-pa-claim-movies-portrayal-destroys-his-name-37920667.html|title=Family of Belfast man Prenter who was Freddie Mercury's PA claim movie's portrayal destroys his name|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate= 14 July 2019|date= 15 March 2019}}</ref> In real life, Prenter was a former radio DJ who became Mercury's PA in 1977, two years after the release of ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-paul-prenter-the-bohemian-rhapsody-villain-had-a-more-complex-relationship-with-the-band-irl-13040678|title=What Happened To Paul Prenter?

It is based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Lion in Winter|play of the same name]] by [[James Goldman]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Anthony Harvey]], written by [[James Goldman]], and produced by [[Joseph E. Levine]], Jane C. Nusbaum and [[Martin Poll]] from Goldman's adaptation of his own play, ''[[The Lion in Winter]]''.  The film stars [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[John Castle]], [[Anthony Hopkins]] (in his film debut in a major role), [[Jane Merrow]], [[Timothy Dalton]] (in his film debut) and [[Nigel Terry]].\n\nThe film was a commercial success ([[1968 in film|the 11th highest-grossing film of 1968]]) and won three [[Academy Awards]], including one for Hepburn as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (tied with [[Barbra Streisand]]). There was a television [[The Lion in Winter (2003 film)|remake]] in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Lion in Winter'' is set during Christmas 1183, at [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]'s ch\u00e2teau and primary residence in [[Chinon]], [[Touraine]], in the medieval [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry wants his youngest son, the future [[John, King of England|King John]], to inherit his throne, while his estranged and imprisoned wife, Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], temporarily released from prison for the holidays, favors their oldest surviving son, the future [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]. Meanwhile, King [[Philip II of France]], the son and successor of [[Louis VII of France]], Eleanor's ex-husband, has given his half-sister [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alais]], who is currently Henry's mistress, to the future heir, and demands either a wedding or the return of her [[dowry]].\n\n[[File:Hep-lion.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]]]\nAs a ruse, Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard and make him heir-apparent. He makes a side deal with Eleanor for her freedom in return for [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], to be given to John. When the deal is revealed at the wedding, Richard refuses to go through with the ceremony. After Richard leaves, Eleanor masochistically asks Henry to kiss Alais in front of her, and then looks on in horror as they perform a mock marriage ceremony. Having believed Henry's intentions, John, at the direction of middle brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]], plots with Philip to make war on England. Henry and Philip meet to discuss terms, but Henry soon learns that Phillip has been plotting with John and Geoffrey, and that he and Richard were once lovers.\n\nHenry dismisses all three sons as unsuitable and locks them in a wine cellar, telling Alais, \"the royal boys are aging with the royal port.\"<ref>Quote from the 1968 movie, ''The Lion in Winter''.</ref> He makes plans to travel to Rome for an [[annulment]], so that he can have new sons with Alais, but she says he will never be able to release his sons from prison or they will be a threat to his future children. Henry sees that she is right and condemns them to death, but cannot bring himself to kill them, instead letting them escape. He and Eleanor go back to hoping for the future, with Eleanor returning on the barge to prison, laughing it off with Henry before she leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]], [[King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], [[Duke of Normandy]] and of [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], [[Count of Anjou]]\n*[[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], his estranged Queen\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], their eldest surviving son\n*[[John Castle]] as [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], their middle surviving son\n*[[Nigel Terry]] as [[John, King of England|John]], their youngest surviving son\n*[[Timothy Dalton]] as [[Philip II of France|King Philip II of France]] \n*[[Jane Merrow]] as [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alais]], Henry's mistress, betrothed to Richard\n*[[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|Captain William Marshall]]\n*[[Kenneth Ives]] as Queen Eleanor's guard\n*[[O.

Producer [[Martin Poll]] optioned Goldman's novel ''Waldorf'' for the movies. They discussed ''Lion in Winter'' which Poll read and loved. He hired Goldman to write a screenplay. \n\n===Casting===\nPoll was meant to make a film with [[Joseph E. Levine|Joseph Levine]] and [[Peter O'Toole]], ''The Ski Bum'' (which would be written by James Goldman's brother William). That project fell through and Poll suggested they do ''Lion in Winter'' instead.<ref>Smith, C. (1968, Dec 01). 'Lion in winter'--play that refused to die.

The Vexin is located northwest of Paris, between it and Rouen.]]\n\nThough the background and the eventual destinies of the characters are generally historically accurate, ''The Lion in Winter'' is fictional; none of the dialogue or action is historical. There was a Christmas court at [[Caen]] in 1182, but there was no Christmas court at Chinon in 1183. In reality, Henry had many mistresses and many illegitimate children; the \"[[Rosamund Clifford|Rosamund]]\" mentioned in the film was his mistress until she died. The article on the [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174]] describes the historical events leading to the play's events. There was also a second rebellion, when Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted in 1183, resulting in Young Henry's death. While some historians have theorized that [[Richard_I_of_England#Character_and_sexuality|Richard was homosexual]], historians remain divided on the question.\n\nGeoffrey died in 1186 in a jousting tournament held in Paris (with some speculation that Geoffrey was involved in plotting against Henry with Philip at the time). A third rebellion against Henry by Richard and Philip in 1189 was finally successful, and a decisively defeated Henry retreated to Chinon in Anjou, where he died. Richard the Lionheart succeeded Henry II, but spent very little time in England (perhaps 6 months), after which he became a central Christian commander during the [[Third Crusade]], leading the campaign after the departure of Philip. Richard won some considerable victories, but he did not succeed in retaking Jerusalem. John finally succeeded Richard in 1199 after Richard's death. During his unsuccessful reign he lost most of his father's holdings in Northern France and angered the English barons, who revolted and forced him to sign the [[Magna Carta]]. John is also known for being the villain in the [[Robin Hood]] legends. Lastly, [[William_Marshal,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke|Captain William Marshall]], who during the film is harried about by Henry II, outlived the English royal family and eventually ruled England as regent for the young [[Henry_III,_King of England|Henry III]].<ref>Painter, S., William Marshal, Knight-Errant, Baron & Regent of England, p.268</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of historical drama films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Paden|first=William|title=I Learned It at the Movies: Teaching Medieval Film ''in:'' Postmodern Medievalisms|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Utz|editor2-first=Jesse G|editor2-last=Swan|location=Cambridge|publisher=Brewer|year=2004|pages=79\u201398|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|title=Katharine Hepburn: An Independent Woman|year=1996|publisher=Arcade Publishing|page=[https://archive.org/details/katharinehepburn00berg/page/155 155]|isbn=9781559703512|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/katharinehepburn00berg/page/155}}\n* {{cite book|last=Callan|first=Michael Feeney|authorlink=Michael Feeney Callan|year=2004|title=Anthony Hopkins: A Three Act Life|location=London|publisher=Robson Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthonyhopkinsth0000call/page/98 98, 100, 105]|isbn=186105761X|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/anthonyhopkinsth0000call/page/98}}\n* {{cite book|last=Wapshott|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Wapshott|year=1984|title=Peter O'Toole: A Biography|publisher=Beaufort Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/peterotoolebiogr00waps/page/145 145]|isbn=9780825301964|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/peterotoolebiogr00waps/page/145}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|23125}}\n* {{IMDb title|0063227}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1012386-lion_in_winter}}\n* {{tcmdb title|81467}}\n \n{{Anthony Harvey}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''The Lion in Winter''\n| list =\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureDrama 1961-1980}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lion in Winter (1968 film), The}}\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:1960s drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s historical films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about English royalty]]\n[[Category:British Christmas films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British epic films]]\n[[Category:Henry II of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Richard I of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John, King of England]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wales]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Anthony Harvey]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 12th century]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Goldman]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:1960s LGBT-related films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1968 historical drama film directed by Anthony Harvey}}\n{{For|the 1966 Broadway play|The Lion in Winter}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Lion in Winter\n| image          = Lion In Winter1.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Anthony Harvey]]\n| producer       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Joseph E.

It is based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Lion in Winter|play of the same name]] by [[James Goldman]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Anthony Harvey]], written by [[James Goldman]], and produced by [[Joseph E. Levine]], Jane C. Nusbaum and [[Martin Poll]] from Goldman's adaptation of his own play, ''[[The Lion in Winter]]''.  The film stars [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[John Castle]], [[Anthony Hopkins]] (in his film debut in a major role), [[Jane Merrow]], [[Timothy Dalton]] (in his film debut) and [[Nigel Terry]].\n\nThe film was a commercial success ([[1968 in film|the 11th highest-grossing film of 1968]]) and won three [[Academy Awards]], including one for Hepburn as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (tied with [[Barbra Streisand]]). There was a television [[The Lion in Winter (2003 film)|remake]] in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Lion in Winter'' is set during Christmas 1183, at [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]'s ch\u00e2teau and primary residence in [[Chinon]], [[Touraine]], in the medieval [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry wants his youngest son, the future [[John, King of England|King John]], to inherit his throne, while his estranged and imprisoned wife, Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], temporarily released from prison for the holidays, favors their oldest surviving son, the future [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]. Meanwhile, King [[Philip II of France]], the son and successor of [[Louis VII of France]], Eleanor's ex-husband, has given his half-sister [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alais]], who is currently Henry's mistress, to the future heir, and demands either a wedding or the return of her [[dowry]].\n\n[[File:Hep-lion.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]]]\nAs a ruse, Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard and make him heir-apparent. He makes a side deal with Eleanor for her freedom in return for [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], to be given to John. When the deal is revealed at the wedding, Richard refuses to go through with the ceremony. After Richard leaves, Eleanor masochistically asks Henry to kiss Alais in front of her, and then looks on in horror as they perform a mock marriage ceremony. Having believed Henry's intentions, John, at the direction of middle brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]], plots with Philip to make war on England. Henry and Philip meet to discuss terms, but Henry soon learns that Phillip has been plotting with John and Geoffrey, and that he and Richard were once lovers.\n\nHenry dismisses all three sons as unsuitable and locks them in a wine cellar, telling Alais, \"the royal boys are aging with the royal port.\"<ref>Quote from the 1968 movie, ''The Lion in Winter''.</ref> He makes plans to travel to Rome for an [[annulment]], so that he can have new sons with Alais, but she says he will never be able to release his sons from prison or they will be a threat to his future children. Henry sees that she is right and condemns them to death, but cannot bring himself to kill them, instead letting them escape. He and Eleanor go back to hoping for the future, with Eleanor returning on the barge to prison, laughing it off with Henry before she leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]], [[King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], [[Duke of Normandy]] and of [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], [[Count of Anjou]]\n*[[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], his estranged Queen\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], their eldest surviving son\n*[[John Castle]] as [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], their middle surviving son\n*[[Nigel Terry]] as [[John, King of England|John]], their youngest surviving son\n*[[Timothy Dalton]] as [[Philip II of France|King Philip II of France]] \n*[[Jane Merrow]] as [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alais]], Henry's mistress, betrothed to Richard\n*[[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|Captain William Marshall]]\n*[[Kenneth Ives]] as Queen Eleanor's guard\n*[[O.

Producer [[Martin Poll]] optioned Goldman's novel ''Waldorf'' for the movies. They discussed ''Lion in Winter'' which Poll read and loved. He hired Goldman to write a screenplay. \n\n===Casting===\nPoll was meant to make a film with [[Joseph E. Levine|Joseph Levine]] and [[Peter O'Toole]], ''The Ski Bum'' (which would be written by James Goldman's brother William).

The Vexin is located northwest of Paris, between it and Rouen.]]\n\nThough the background and the eventual destinies of the characters are generally historically accurate, ''The Lion in Winter'' is fictional; none of the dialogue or action is historical. There was a Christmas court at [[Caen]] in 1182, but there was no Christmas court at Chinon in 1183. In reality, Henry had many mistresses and many illegitimate children; the \"[[Rosamund Clifford|Rosamund]]\" mentioned in the film was his mistress until she died. The article on the [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174]] describes the historical events leading to the play's events. There was also a second rebellion, when Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted in 1183, resulting in Young Henry's death. While some historians have theorized that [[Richard_I_of_England#Character_and_sexuality|Richard was homosexual]], historians remain divided on the question.\n\nGeoffrey died in 1186 in a jousting tournament held in Paris (with some speculation that Geoffrey was involved in plotting against Henry with Philip at the time). A third rebellion against Henry by Richard and Philip in 1189 was finally successful, and a decisively defeated Henry retreated to Chinon in Anjou, where he died. Richard the Lionheart succeeded Henry II, but spent very little time in England (perhaps 6 months), after which he became a central Christian commander during the [[Third Crusade]], leading the campaign after the departure of Philip. Richard won some considerable victories, but he did not succeed in retaking Jerusalem. John finally succeeded Richard in 1199 after Richard's death. During his unsuccessful reign he lost most of his father's holdings in Northern France and angered the English barons, who revolted and forced him to sign the [[Magna Carta]]. John is also known for being the villain in the [[Robin Hood]] legends. Lastly, [[William_Marshal,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke|Captain William Marshall]], who during the film is harried about by Henry II, outlived the English royal family and eventually ruled England as regent for the young [[Henry_III,_King of England|Henry III]].<ref>Painter, S., William Marshal, Knight-Errant, Baron & Regent of England, p.268</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of historical drama films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Paden|first=William|title=I Learned It at the Movies: Teaching Medieval Film ''in:'' Postmodern Medievalisms|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Utz|editor2-first=Jesse G|editor2-last=Swan|location=Cambridge|publisher=Brewer|year=2004|pages=79\u201398|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|title=Katharine Hepburn: An Independent Woman|year=1996|publisher=Arcade Publishing|page=[https://archive.org/details/katharinehepburn00berg/page/155 155]|isbn=9781559703512|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/katharinehepburn00berg/page/155}}\n* {{cite book|last=Callan|first=Michael Feeney|authorlink=Michael Feeney Callan|year=2004|title=Anthony Hopkins: A Three Act Life|location=London|publisher=Robson Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthonyhopkinsth0000call/page/98 98, 100, 105]|isbn=186105761X|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/anthonyhopkinsth0000call/page/98}}\n* {{cite book|last=Wapshott|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Wapshott|year=1984|title=Peter O'Toole: A Biography|publisher=Beaufort Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/peterotoolebiogr00waps/page/145 145]|isbn=9780825301964|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/peterotoolebiogr00waps/page/145}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|23125}}\n* {{IMDb title|0063227}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1012386-lion_in_winter}}\n* {{tcmdb title|81467}}\n \n{{Anthony Harvey}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''The Lion in Winter''\n| list =\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureDrama 1961-1980}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lion in Winter (1968 film), The}}\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:1960s drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s historical films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about English royalty]]\n[[Category:British Christmas films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British epic films]]\n[[Category:Henry II of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Richard I of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John, King of England]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wales]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Anthony Harvey]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 12th century]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Goldman]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:1960s LGBT-related films]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_(1968_film)"}

The objectives of the organization include [[inventory]], [[surveillance]], and protection of [[Public land|public lands,]] as well as revenue generation.\n\n== Objectives ==\nAs per the original objectives of the project, the KSLB will cater to the following government services in the land governance sector:\n\n=== '''Inventorisation of public lands''' ===\nUnder this objective, all the public lands are being surveyed and details are hosted on the official government website. This project was initiated between 2008 and 2009 and as of today, the textual database of 25841 land parcels, a spatial database of 8313 land parcels where resurvey has been completed, and field survey using WGS-84 datum has been completed for 278 land parcels in villages which were not resurveyed so far. The photographs of 5269 land parcels have also been uploaded on the site.\n\n=== '''Income generation from public land''' ===\nThe KSLB will be the sole agency in the state which will act as the custodian of leasable and licensable Government lands. The entire management of lease cases will be carried out through the Lease Alert System (LAS), which is at the final stage of implementation. This would help the government in maximizing the returns through the timely collection of leases without any lapse. Additionally, the land in the commercially important sites will be put to auction for inviting commercial projects from Public Sector agencies on the BOT basis for 25\u201330 years. \n\nThe building plans approved by the KSLB will be allowed at such sites mainly for infrastructure development in the state. In order to protect large areas of government land in rural areas from encroachment, Tree Banks will be established this year, utilizing Mahogany, Teak, Rosewood, and Sandalwood. Considering multipurpose objectives of environmental protection, better returns from Government lands, sustainable income for the Government, protection from encroachment and a measure to meet the future wood requirement of the society, this subprogram will be introduced this year under the annual activity of KSLB. \n\nDuring the imminent plan period, the KSLB is planning to enter a new sector wherein it will act as a Land Transaction consultant buying land from agencies, such as Commercial Banks, that are struggling to manage the attached lands during the loan recovery process. In addition, the KSLB will buy land from the open market to reduce forced sale by the landowners in the state. The KSLB will then prepare a comprehensive list of salable (Units of 5 cents each) lands, which will be available for landless people with visions for the development of rural areas and will be published on the land bank's website. The quota of allotment will be as per Kerala Land Assignment Rules which curb the misuse of such allotted land. The quota for each category will be fixed based on the economic and social background of the applicant and after being cleared by the respective Taluk Land Assignment Committees (TLAC). However, the proposal is still under consideration of the government.\n\n=== '''Surveillance and protection''' ===\nThe KSLB, with its own machinery and with the help of local revenue officials, is undertaking the surveillance activities of the Government lands. The creation of a Public Land Protection Force (PLPF) is currently at the final stage of implementation. The personnel from PLPF and the Village Officers will sign the Beat Registers to be maintained at monthly intervals so as to assure two inspections to a site in a month.\n\nA 24x7 [[toll-free number]] is available for reporting Encroachment|encroachments of public lands by the general public and also to inform about the Government lands which are left out from inclusion in the website.
