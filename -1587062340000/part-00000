The [[axon]]s and their [[myelin sheath]] are damaged in this kind of injury, but the [[endoneurium]], [[perineurium]] and [[epineurium]] remain intact. Motor and sensory functions distal to the point of injury are completely lost over time leading to [[Wallerian degeneration]] due to [[ischemia]], or loss of blood supply. Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or [[contusion]] than [[neurapraxia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Critical Pathways in Therapeutic Intervention.|last=Saidoff|first=David C.|last2=McDonough|first2=Andrew|publisher=Mosby Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-323-00105-X|location=Missouri|pages=262}}</ref>\n\nAxonotmesis mainly follows a stretch injury. These stretch injuries can either dislocate joints or fracture a limb, due to which peripheral nerves are severed. If the sharp pain from the exposed axon of the nerve is not observed, one can identify a nerve injury from abnormal sensations in their limb. A doctor may ask for a [[nerve conduction velocity]] (NCV) test to completely diagnose the issue. If diagnosed as nerve injury, [[electromyography]] performed after 3 to 4 weeks shows signs of [[denervation]]s and [[fibrillation]]s, or irregular connections and contractions of muscles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthhype.com/nerve-injury-neuropraxia-axonotmesis-neurotmesis-and-healing.html|title=Nerve Injury (Neuropraxia, Axonotmesis, Neurotmesis) and Healing {{!}} Healthhype.com|website=www.healthhype.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref>\n\n== Injury classification ==\nThere are two kinds of nerve injury classifications:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Menorca|first=Ron M.

Sensory fibers lesions cause the sensory problems below to the site of injury. Motor fibers injuries may involve lower motor neurons, sympathetic fibers, and or both.\n\nAssessment items include:\n* [[Sensory fibers]] that send sensory information to the [[central nervous system]].\n* [[Motor fibers]] that allow movement of [[skeletal muscle]].\n* [[Sympathetic fibers]] that innervate the skin and blood vessels of the [[Limb (anatomy)|four extremities.]]\n\nIn assessment, sensory-motor defects may be mild, moderate, or severe. Damage to motor fibers results in paralysis of the muscles. [[Nervous plexus]] injuries create more signs and symptoms from sensory-motor problems (such as [[brachial plexus injuries]]). In these cases, the prognosis depends on the amount of damage and the degree of functional impairment.\n\n==EMG and NCV findings==\n\n=== Changes in EMG ===\n\n[[Electromyography]] (EMG) is a medical test performed to evaluate and record the electrical activity (electromyogram) produced by skeletal muscles using an instrument called electromyograph. In axonotmesis, EMG changes (2 to 3 weeks after injury) in the denervated muscles include:\n# Fibrillation potentials (FP)\n# Positive sharp waves\n\n=== Changes in NCV ([[nerve conduction velocity]]) ===\n\nEMG test is often performed together with another test called nerve conduction study, which measures the conducting function of nerves. NCV study shows loss of nerve conduction in the [[distal]] segment (3 to 4 days after injury). According to NCV study, in axonotmesis there is an absence of distal sensory-motor responses.\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Schwann cell]]s provide the nerve with protection through the production of [[Nerve growth factor|Nerve Growth Factors]], and because these cells are intact this kind of nerve injury can be cured and normal feeling and sensations can be restored. Surgery can be done in order to help the nerve heal. The surgery will help with nerve regeneration, providing guidance to the nerve sprouts on where to attach on the [[proximal]] side of the injury. Damaged nerve axons can reattach themselves after surgery.<ref name=\":0\" /> Treatment of axonotmesis also consists of:\n* [[Physical therapy]] or Occupational Therapy. Physical or Occupational therapy aims include:\n** Pain relief\n** Maintain range of motion\n** Reducing [[muscular atrophy]]\n** Patient education\n* Use of assistive devices (Orthotic needs)\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis is usually good in terms of recovery. Rate of recovery depends on the distance from the site of injury, and [[axon]]al [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] can go up to 1 inch per month. Complete recovery can take anywhere from 6 months to a year<ref>Otto D. Payton & Richard P. Di Fabio et al. Manual of physical therapy. Churchill Livingstone Inc.

Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or [[contusion]] than [[neurapraxia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Critical Pathways in Therapeutic Intervention.|last=Saidoff|first=David C.|last2=McDonough|first2=Andrew|publisher=Mosby Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-323-00105-X|location=Missouri|pages=262}}</ref>\n\nAxonotmesis mainly follows a stretch injury. These stretch injuries can either dislocate joints or fracture a limb, due to which peripheral nerves are severed. If the sharp pain from the exposed axon of the nerve is not observed, one can identify a nerve injury from abnormal sensations in their limb. A doctor may ask for a [[Nerve conduction velocity|Nerve Conduction Velocity]] (NCV) test to completely diagnose the issue. If diagnosed as nerve injury, [[Electromyography]] performed after 3 to 4 weeks shows signs of [[denervation]]s and [[fibrillation]]s, or irregular connections and contractions of muscles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthhype.com/nerve-injury-neuropraxia-axonotmesis-neurotmesis-and-healing.html|title=Nerve Injury (Neuropraxia, Axonotmesis, Neurotmesis) and Healing {{!}} Healthhype.com|website=www.healthhype.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref>\n\n== Injury classification ==\nThere are two kinds of nerve injury classifications:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Menorca|first=Ron M.

Sensory fibers lesions cause the sensory problems below to the site of injury. Motor fibers injuries may involve lower motor neurons, sympathetic fibers, and or both.\n\nAssessment items include:\n* [[Sensory fibers]] that send sensory information to the [[central nervous system]].\n* [[Motor fibers]] that allow movement of [[skeletal muscle]].\n* [[Sympathetic fibers]] that innervate the skin and blood vessels of the [[Limb (anatomy)|four extremities.]]\n\nIn assessment, sensory-motor defects may be mild, moderate, or severe. Damage to motor fibers results in paralysis of the muscles. [[Nervous plexus]] injuries create more signs and symptoms from sensory-motor problems (such as [[brachial plexus injuries]]). In these cases, the prognosis depends on the amount of damage and the degree of functional impairment.\n\n==EMG and NCV findings==\n\n=== Changes in EMG ===\n\n[[Electromyography]] (EMG) is a medical test performed to evaluate and record the electrical activity (electromyogram) produced by skeletal muscles using an instrument called electromyograph. In axonotmesis, EMG changes (2 to 3 weeks after injury) in the denervated muscles include:\n# Fibrillation potentials (FP)\n# Positive sharp waves\n\n=== Changes in NCV ([[nerve conduction velocity]]) ===\n\nEMG test is often performed together with another test called nerve conduction study, which measures the conducting function of nerves. NCV study shows loss of nerve conduction in the [[distal]] segment (3 to 4 days after injury). According to NCV study, in axonotmesis there is an absence of distal sensory-motor responses.\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Schwann cell]]s provide the nerve with protection through the production of [[Nerve growth factor|Nerve Growth Factors]], and because these cells are intact this kind of nerve injury can be cured and normal feeling and sensations can be restored. Surgery can be done in order to help the nerve heal. The surgery will help with nerve regeneration, providing guidance to the nerve sprouts on where to attach on the [[proximal]] side of the injury. Damaged nerve axons can reattach themselves after surgery.<ref name=\":0\" /> Treatment of axonotmesis also consists of:\n* [[Physical therapy]] or Occupational Therapy. Physical or Occupational therapy aims include:\n** Pain relief\n** Maintain range of motion\n** Reducing [[muscular atrophy]]\n** Patient education\n* Use of assistive devices (Orthotic needs)\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis is usually good in terms of recovery. Rate of recovery depends on the distance from the site of injury, and [[axon]]al [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] can go up to 1 inch per month. Complete recovery can take anywhere from 6 months to a year<ref>Otto D. Payton & Richard P. Di Fabio et al. Manual of physical therapy. Churchill Livingstone Inc.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry#Men's Basketball}}\n\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons.
