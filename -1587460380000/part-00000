She imagines that characters Beast and Hamilton Hocks are her friends.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n{{:List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Maggie (voiced by Kristen Bone) is a five-year-old girl (who later turns six years old)  and the human protagonist of the show. She is Hamilton's and Beast's best friend. They both look up to Maggie very much and always turn to her for advice. Maggie is the leader of the group and is always there to be the compassionate voice of reason to her dear friends.\n* The Ferocious Beast (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) he is very scary or ferocious. However, he can shout louder than anybody. He is a yellow beast, with big red removable spots, and three horns on his head. His favorite catchphrase is \"Great googly moogly!\", which he says several times per episode. In \"Hide And Go Beast\", it is shown that he is allergic to pollen. He is just a big softie, despite his bold appearance. Beast loves pumpkins, which is convenient since there is an impressive pumpkin patch in Nowhere Land. As a matter of fact, Beast loves pretty much any kind of food, including Hamilton's cooking, and is almost always hungry. He even loves baths. Maggie and Hamilton are his best friends. He wears multi-colored galoshes which he pronounces as \"Goo-lashes\". Hamilton always corrects him about the pronunciation, but he does not believe him.\n* Hamilton Hocks (voiced by Michael Caruana) is a pig who can be bossy and quite fussy, but he has a warm heart. He lives inside a portable cardboard box which he loves, is the best cook in Nowhere Land, and is a total clean freak. Hamilton's most prized possessions are his beautiful \"H\" sweater and his cardboard box, which also happens to be his home. Maggie and the Beast are his best friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Rudy the Mouse: Rudy is a cheese-loving mouse who lives in a large wheel of cheese in a part of Nowhere Land called Cheese Town. It is revealed in one episode that Rudy's hat and boots do not come off because they are glued to him. Strangely enough, this character started off with the name Pippy but was renamed by the writers soon after.\n* Nedley the Rabbit: Nedley speaks in rhymes. He says rhymes almost all through every episode that he appears in, but sometimes he talks normally a little bit before starting his rhyme again. Nedley lives in a rabbit hole next to his carrot patch in Nowhere Land.\n* The Moo Sisters: They are the three cows who live in a part of Nowhere Land called Mooville. They love to sing and do it often. They are sisters and their names are Millicent, Mavis and Marge.\n* Mr. Moon: He is the only non-human and non-animal character in the episode \"Blue Moon\". He is usually grumpy because people say he is made of green cheese.\n* The Kindly Giant: The Kindly Giant is not at all scary but instead kind hearted. The others are scared at first but they soon get used to him and they sometimes go to him for advice or a favour. He refers to Maggie, Hamilton and the Beast as little ones. He owns a garden full of fruits and vegetables, from which he always lets the ever hungry Beast scarf up a giant blueberry or two. His face is never shown, and he only appears in a few episodes. He is big and strong. Even the Beast seems small compared to the giant. The Kindly Giant lives in an area of Nowhere Land where all the fruits and vegetables are giant sized. Usually, only his shoes and ankles are seen due to his largeness.\n* The Dream Sheep: White sheep that make \"baa\" sounds. They are occasionally up in the clouds.\n* The Jellybean Team: They are a group of seven jellybeans. There is a red one, an orange one, a yellow one, a purple one, a black one and two green ones. They are small, of course, but have big personalities. They also tend to argue with each other a lot because they each think they are more important than the others.\n* The Triplets: Maggie's baby cousins (Zack, Max, and Oscar). They only appear in four episodes, \"One, Two, Three\", \"Home of the Kindly Giant\", \"The New Rubber Ball\" and \"Which Way Did They Go?\".\n* Big Duck: A large duck with white feathers who lives in the water. She is the focus of the episode \"The Big Duck\" and appears in the series' theme song.\n* Reggie Van Beast: Beast's cousin. His coloring is the inverse of Beast's, being red with yellow spots, and he wears a monocle. He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\".\n\n==Production==\nThe theme song for the show is \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\" which is an original song by [[Isabella Molley]]. ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' is produced by [[Nelvana]], and directed by [[Jamie Whitney]] and [[Stuart Shankly]]. The series debuted in 2001 and the series aired its last episode in 2003. The show is distributed by Nelvana. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original Canadian soundtrack. The shorts were shown with the original voices.\n\n==Broadcast==\nIn Canada, ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' aired on [[Teletoon]] and [[Treehouse TV]]. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] as part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block from June 5, 2000, to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]) from April 7, 2003, until September 27, 2009, when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010.

The station's name was originally [[Ilwaco, Washington|Ilwaco]] Beach, and only later became known as Klipsan Station. The station was one of several assigned to provide protection in the area known as the [[Graveyard of the Pacific]].\n\n==Location==\nOn the [[Long Beach Peninsula]], in [[Pacific County, Washington]], about 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) north of [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]].\n\n==Construction and architecture==\nThe station was established in 1891.  It was built according to the \"Marquette\" style of life-saving stations, one of a number of standard station designs adopted by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]].<ref>Shanks, York, and Shanks, ''The U.S. Life-Saving Service - Heroes, Rescues and Architecture of the Early Coast Guar''d, at page 202, Costano Books, Petaluma, CA (1996) {{ISBN|0-930268-16-4}}</ref>  This pattern received its name from the station where it was first used, [[Marquette, Michigan]]. There were 13 other life-saving Marquette stations, their architect was [[Albert B. Bibb]], and it is speculated that the plans were drawn up in 1889.  Other Marquette stations on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] include those at [[Yaquina Bay]], the [[Umpqua River]], [[Coos Bay]], and the [[Coquille River (Oregon)|Coquille River]] in [[Oregon]] and at [[Southside, California]].<ref name=SYS>Shanks, York, and Shanks, at 110</ref>  \nThe boat house was also built according to a standard [[United States Life-Saving Service]] plan, called the \"witch's hat\" for the design's use of a distinct octagonal ventilator with a conical roof.\n* [http://content.lib.washington.edu/cgi-bin/viewer.exe?CISOROOT=/wastate&CISOPTR=417&CISORESTMP=&CISOVIEWTMP= Ilwaco (later Klipsan Beach) Life Saving Station, circa 1895]\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:US Life Saving Service.gif|thumb|right|200px|Emblem of the U.S. Life-Saving Service]]\n\n===Volunteer operations===\nThe station was first started in 1889 on a volunteer basis, and called the Ilwaco Beach station.

It was built according to the \"Marquette\" style of life-saving stations, one of a number of standard station designs adopted by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]].<ref>Shanks, York, and Shanks, ''The U.S. Life-Saving Service - Heroes, Rescues and Architecture of the Early Coast Guar''d, at page 202, Costano Books, Petaluma, CA (1996) {{ISBN|0-930268-16-4}}</ref>  This pattern received its name from the station where it was first used, [[Marquette, Michigan]]. There were 13 other life-saving Marquette stations, their architect was [[Albert B. Bibb]], and it is speculated that the plans were drawn up in 1889.

Northrop was later recast as another new character, [[Alex North (fiction)|Dr. Alex North]], and scenes from Northrop's time playing Roman were edited to create the new character's backstory.\n\n==Characterization==\nRoman is the retired police commissioner of the fictional Midwestern town of Salem, and currently manages and tends bar at his family's business, the Brady Pub. He is also a former agent of the fictional [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|International Security Alliance]] (ISA), a spy agency focused on all sorts of unusually high-level global conspiracies that tended to center around his otherwise-quiet home town. During his portrayal by Northrop, he was established as a top-notch cop but also a bit of a renegade, often accepting deep-cover assignments, and a master of disguise (similar to Sherlock Holmes). Hogestyn's character was more by-the-book on the job, although still dangerous with a dark side somewhat characteristic of an ex-spy (which later fed into the \"John Black\" persona), with expertise in [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Jeet Kune Do]], and a little more of a ladies' man. Taylor's portrayal is more that of a \"regular guy\", with a bit less intrigue and more straightforward professionally, although still with an eye for the ladies and more inclined to engage in [[one night stand|one-night stands]] with various women than the character as portrayed by Northrop or Hogestyn (such as with Kate Roberts, Billie Reed, ex-wives Anna DiMera and Marlena Evans, and a strongly hinted at \u2013 but never confirmed \u2013 rendezvous with Nicole Walker).\n\nOver the years, much has been made of the creation (and constant [[retcon]] of the backstory) of [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn's]] character John Black as an entirely separate character than that of Roman Brady, especially after the show had invested over five years in establishing John's identity as Roman, complete with a plausible backstory of his \u201ctime away\u201d (while he was being held captive, brainwashed, and trained\u2014-unsuccessfully\u2014-to be an assassin by Stefano DiMera), and \"Roman's\" reemerging memories. However, with Roman's recasts and changes in characterization over the years (while John has consistently been played by Hogestyn), in hindsight it can be said that it was actually John Black that remained more true to the original \"Roman\" persona, and that it was Roman that was gradually developed into a separate character. This was especially illustrated in 2016 when Roman, who had always been a straight-shooter with regard to the law, became complicit in the cover-up of sister-in-law [[Hope Brady]]'s murder of [[Stefano DiMera]], who she wrongly believed was responsible for the disappearance and later death of her husband (and Roman's brother) [[Bo Brady]].\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===1981\u201384===\nRoman Brady first appeared on Days to protect Marlena Evans from a serial killer.<ref>Days of Our Lives Episode dated January 8, 1982</ref> He slept on her floor. The chemistry between the actors, and the characters, led to love. In 1983 on Days of Our Lives, Roman and Marlena were married. Over the next year Roman became embroiled in a storyline with Stefano DiMera. Stefano was a powerful and ruthless business tycoon (and organized crime figure) from Europe who had come to town to set up shop in Salem, and Roman being the city's top cop had gone after him. Subsequently Stefano framed Roman for serial killings that were being committed by his nephew Andre DiMera. At the time Marlena saw Roman killing a woman. Later it was shown that Andre had used a realistic mask. Roman was jailed. Mrs. Alice Horton baked him some drugged doughnuts, and on the way to the hospital Roman escaped. He went on the run to prove his innocence, and he accomplished that. He was promoted, and Stefano was on the run.\n\nIn November 1984 Roman tracked Stefano to a Caribbean island where many other characters had crash-landed, too. Stefano was suffering from incurable cancer, and needed to collect three mysterious prisms to unlock a secret formula to cure himself. Roman caught up to him on a cliff, but Stefano pulled a gun. He shot Roman, who seemingly fell to his death. His brother Bo cradled him in his arms on the beach, but had to leave him for a few minutes. When he returned the body was gone. Bo assumed that while he was away, the tide had come in and washed Roman\u2019s body out to sea, for which Bo blamed himself for years. Several episodes later Roman was shown aboard Stefano's yacht, motionless.\n\n===1986\u20131990===\n:{{main|John Black (Days of our Lives)}}\nIn 1986 an amnesiac known only as \"The Pawn\" appeared in Salem on January 23, 1986.<ref>Lucille Giordano, Inside Days of Our Lives July 1995.</ref> He assumed the name \"John Black\" after reading it on a Vietnam War memorial in Salem. Eventually the character was revealed to be Roman Brady having undergone extensive plastic surgery, brainwashing, and martial arts training (purportedly to be trained as an assassin) by Stefano DiMera. After an uneasy \"re-introduction\" to his family and friends in Salem, the character resumed his life as Roman.\n\nIn 1988, a storyline featuring a reappearance by Stefano (who had been believed dead) focused on what had happened to Roman during his time in captivity (1984\u20131986). Roman and loved ones traveled back to the Caribbean island where Roman had \"died\" in 1984, and it was revealed that the ISA knew all along that Roman was being held by Stefano and being trained via brainwashing, and extensive instruction by a martial arts master named Orion Hawk, to be one of Stefano's assassins. In fact, the ISA unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate Orion's training camp to extract Roman, but this failed due to the high level of security at Stefano's compound as well as Roman's brainwashed state. This tied into the introduction of [[Benjy Hawk|Benjy]], Stefano's son (and Orion's grandson) who was fostered for a while by [[Steve Johnson (Days of our Lives)|Steve]] and [[Kayla Johnson]]. Although subtle hints pointed to the possibility of this \"Roman\" turning out to be someone else, abetted by speculation by fans and by [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn]] himself, the clues seemed to tie back together with the resolution that, at least for the moment, the character portrayed by Hogestyn was in fact Roman Brady.\n\n===1991\u201394===\nAfter believing that Roman's wife, Marlena Evans, had been dead for some years, he had fallen in love with a woman named [[Isabella Toscano]]. In 1991 Marlena turns up alive. In August 1991 the character who had been presumed as Roman Brady since 1986 is retroactively revealed to be a separate character (now once again called John Black) who was brainwashed to believe he was Roman, when what would now be the real Roman (once again played by Wayne Northrop) was found on an island where he had been imprisoned by Stefano. Roman was shocked when he found he had been replaced and all his family had accepted John Black as him and John Black had a difficult time accepting he was not really Roman. Roman went back to his life, and he and Marlena tried to live once again as man and wife. After the death of Isabella, in his grief John turned to Marlena for comfort. The two found themselves unable to resolve their feelings for each other from their life together when John believed himself to be Roman. He and Marlena had an affair that resulted in the birth of a daughter, [[Belle Black|Isabella]], named after [[Isabella Toscano]], whom Roman believed to be his own daughter. When he discovered that Marlena and John had an affair and that Belle was not his real daughter, Roman was crushed. In June 1994, Roman leaves town broken and bitter, once again with no family.<ref>{{cite episode|series= Days Of Our Lives |series-link= Days of Our Lives |number = 7304|network=[[NBC]]|credits= [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] ([[Executive producer]]s); [[James E.

The cure to his ailment was discovered by John, Hope, and Stefano in a jungle mission that was engineered to drive John and Marlena apart, but in the end had the opposite result.\n\nRoman was \"killed\" during the Salem Stalker Murders in December 2003 during his wedding reception to Kate Roberts, but again was revealed to not really be dead. He lived on the island of Melaswen (New Salem) with every other victim from the Salem Stalker Murders, including Marlena. Eventually, other Salemites arrived on the island, trying to find their \"dead\" loved ones. Some of them went out in the jungle, looking for a way off the island, while the rest remained in \"Salem\" waiting for help. Help finally arrived. Jennifer got to the island, then Hope and Patrick and finally Bo and John. Everyone banded together to get off the island, but Tony wasn't going to make it easy. He created a volcanic eruption, which eventually caused a giant wave. As everyone gathered on makeshift rafts to get off the island, the wave crashed over them. The Coast Guard arrived and managed to rescue some of them, but Roman, Marlena, Jack, and his daughter Cassie were not saved. They were in the clutches of Tony DiMera once again, and he took them to a remote European castle where he held them captive.\n\nWhile in the castle, Tony DiMera (actually Andre DiMera) tormented Roman and Marlena with video of John and Kate growing ever closer back in Salem. Eventually, they believed the two of them had sex, and Roman and Marlena, needing comfort, had sex as well. Shortly thereafter, Jack made his way into their room. They escaped! Through fire and explosions, our group of intrepid Salemites \u2013 Marlena, Roman, Jack and Cassie \u2013 all got out and were on their way home.\n\nOn the ISA jet on the way back to Salem, Roman and Marlena made the decision to not tell Kate and John that they had sex. Marlena was uncomfortable with lying to John, but eventually agreed with Roman. When they arrived back they were shocked to learn that John and Kate had fallen in love and were engaged to be married, but Roman and Marlena still didn't tell the truth about their affair. Soon after they were back Marlena discovered that she was pregnant and that Roman had to be the father, but when the truth came out John wasn't too forgiving. During a fight between Roman and John, Marlena tumbled down the stairs, causing a miscarriage.\n\n===2010s===\nAs the second decade of the 21st century has unfolded, Roman is the commissioner of the Salem police force. After an ill-fated marriage to Kate Roberts, he has remained single and adopted an elder-statesman, back-burner role on the show. He serves primarily as the de facto patriarch of the Brady family and the supervisor and occasional voice-of-reason to junior police officers and ISA agents (with a [[catchphrase]] of sorts developing from his consistent inquiries of \"what da hell\" is going on). He has largely made peace with his past with [[Stefano DiMera]], [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]], and [[Victor Kiriakis]], and remains friends with ex-wives Anna DiMera, [[Marlena Evans]], and Kate Roberts, and is occasionally shown as having a soft spot for all of them. In March 2017 he retired as police commissioner and was seen in a later episode tending bar at the Brady Pub. In 2018 he began working with his friends John Black and Steve Johnson at their private detective business, Black Patch.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/roman.php Roman at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brady, Roman}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional police captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional American police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional police commissioners]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character from Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Days of our Lives\n| image1 = File:joshasroman.jpg\n| caption1 = Josh Taylor as Roman Brady\n| image2 = File:DOOLNorthrop-Roman.jpg\n| caption2 = Wayne Northrop as Roman Brady\n| image3 = File:Drake_Hogestyn_as_Roman.jpg\n| caption3 = Drake Hogestyn as [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|\"Roman\"]]\n| name = Roman Brady\n| portrayer = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Wayne Northrop]] (1981\u201384, 1991\u201394)\n* [[Josh Taylor (actor)|Josh Taylor]] (1997\u2013) \n}} \n| creator = [[Pat Falken Smith]]\n| introducer = [[Betty Corday]] and [[Al Rabin]]\n| years = {{Flat list |\n*1981\u201384\n*1991\u201394\n*1997\u2013\n}}\n| first = {{start date|1981|12|08}}\n| last = \n| appeared = <!-- for an episode date if the episode is unnamed -->\n| only = <!-- for an episode title or season -->\n| classification = [[Days of Our Lives cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| books = \n| spinoffs = \n| alias = \n| occupation = Police commissioner (retired)\n| home = Salem, [[United States|Illinois]]\n| family = Brady family\n| spouse= {{ubl|[[Anna DiMera|Anna Brady]] (until 1982)|[[Marlena Evans]] (1983\u201394)|[[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] (2003\u201305)}}\n| husband= \n| parents= {{ubl|[[Shawn Brady]]|[[Caroline Brady]]}}\n| brothers = {{ubl|[[Frankie Brady]] (adoptive)|[[Max Brady]] (adoptive)}}\n| sisters = {{ubl|[[Kimberly Brady]]|[[Kayla Brady]]}}\n| halfbrothers = [[Bo Brady]]\n| sons = {{ubl|[[Eric Brady]]|[[Rex Brady]]}}\n| daughters = {{ubl|[[Carrie Brady]]|[[Sami Brady]]|[[Cassie Brady]]}}\n| grandsons = {{ubl|[[Will Horton]]|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Johnny DiMera|Johnny DiMera]]|Noah Reed}}\n| granddaughters = {{ubl|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Allie Horton|Allie Horton]]|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Sydney DiMera|Sydney DiMera]]}}Emily Lockhart <br> Mackenzie Horton \n| grandparents= Peter Brady\n| aunts/uncles= Eric Brady<br>[[Colleen Brady]] <br> Molly Murphy \n| cousins= Ryan Brady <br> [[Colin Murphy (Days of our Lives)|Colin Murphy]] \n| nieces/nephews= Andrew Donovan <br> [[Theresa Donovan]] <br> [[Stephanie Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Stephanie Johnson]] <br> [[Joey Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Joey Johnson]] <br> [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]] <br> [[Chelsea Brady]] <br> [[Zack Brady]] <br> [[Ciara Brady]]\n}}\n'''Roman Brady''' is a [[fictional character]] from the long-running [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.

Northrop was later recast as another new character, [[Alex North (fiction)|Dr. Alex North]], and scenes from Northrop's time playing Roman were edited to create the new character's backstory.\n\n==Characterization==\nRoman is the retired police commissioner of the fictional Midwestern town of Salem, and currently manages and tends bar at his family's business, the Brady Pub. He is also a former agent of the fictional [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|International Security Alliance]] (ISA), a spy agency focused on all sorts of unusually high-level global conspiracies that tended to center around his otherwise-quiet home town. During his portrayal by Northrop, he was established as a top-notch cop but also a bit of a renegade, often accepting deep-cover assignments, and a master of disguise (similar to Sherlock Holmes). Hogestyn's character was more by-the-book on the job, although still dangerous with a dark side somewhat characteristic of an ex-spy (which later fed into the \"John Black\" persona), with expertise in [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Jeet Kune Do]], and a little more of a ladies' man. Taylor's portrayal is more that of a \"regular guy\", with a bit less intrigue and more straightforward professionally, although still with an eye for the ladies and more inclined to engage in [[one night stand|one-night stands]] with various women than the character as portrayed by Northrop or Hogestyn (such as with Kate Roberts, Billie Reed, ex-wives Anna DiMera and Marlena Evans, and a strongly hinted at \u2013 but never confirmed \u2013 rendezvous with Nicole Walker).\n\nOver the years, much has been made of the creation (and constant [[retcon]] of the backstory) of [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn's]] character John Black as an entirely separate character than that of Roman Brady, especially after the show had invested over five years in establishing John's identity as Roman, complete with a plausible backstory of his \u201ctime away\u201d (while he was being held captive, brainwashed, and trained\u2014-unsuccessfully\u2014-to be an assassin by Stefano DiMera), and \"Roman's\" reemerging memories. However, with Roman's recasts and changes in characterization over the years (while John has consistently been played by Hogestyn), in hindsight it can be said that it was actually John Black that remained more true to the original \"Roman\" persona, and that it was Roman that was gradually developed into a separate character. This was especially illustrated in 2016 when Roman, who had always been a straight-shooter with regard to the law, became complicit in the cover-up of sister-in-law [[Hope Brady]]'s murder of [[Stefano DiMera]], who she wrongly believed was responsible for the disappearance and later death of her husband (and Roman's brother) [[Bo Brady]].\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===1981\u201384===\nRoman Brady first appeared on Days to protect Marlena Evans from a serial killer.<ref>Days of Our Lives Episode dated January 8, 1982</ref> He slept on her floor.

This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], or ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], that are commonly cited as \"best-selling books\" yet have no reliable sales figures. Similarly, many notable book series that sold very widely are poorly documented ([[Land of Oz]]) or consist of multiple sub-series ([[Tom Swift]]).\n\nAccording to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as of 1995, the [[Bible]] is the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5{{nbsp}}billion copies sold and distributed.<ref name=\"guinnessworldrecords\">{{cite web|title=Best selling book of non-fiction|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=15 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315025558/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|archivedate=15 March 2015}}</ref>  The ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'', also known as the ''Little Red Book'', has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures \u2014 with estimates ranging from 800{{nbsp}}million<ref name=\"guinnessworldrecords\"/> to over 6.5 billion printed volumes,<ref>Zhengyuan Fu, ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'', Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 186.

It had nothing to do with justice at all, but it has to do with maintaining discipline The US army was very concerned that black soldiers particularly did not learn to act differently when they were away from home and race was one way they could be reminded of their place. |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Radio Chocolate Soldier From the USA 003\">{{cite AV media| title=Chocolate Soldier From the USA | others=[[BBC]] | publisher=WNKU - NKU's National Public Radio station | date=26 February 1999 |url=http://caa.nku.edu/programreview/docs/sociologyreview05.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609201126/http://caa.nku.edu/programreview/docs/sociologyreview05.pdf | archivedate=9 June 2010 | quote=US Broadcast}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Radio Chocolate Soldier From the USA 004\">{{cite book|title=Amnesty: The Journal of the British Section of Amnesty International, Issues 59-86 |year=1993|publisher=The Section|page=79|quote=Black soldiers who fought in the European theatre of operations in World War II were treated shamefully - and still are, said Marc Jobst }}</ref>\n\n<!--  #######          Ref List  - TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY          ######  -->\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Amnesty Media Awards TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/pressawards97/tvdoc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129234520/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/pressawards97/tvdoc.html |archivedate=29 January 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Channel Four Witness Rwanda - The Betrayal 001\">{{cite episode|title=Rwanda - The Betrayal |series=Witness |network=[[Channel 4]] |date=16 May 1996 |quote=Library Synopisis \"The atrocities in Rwanda two years ago, when members of the Hutu majority slaughtered thousands of men, women and children from the Tutsi minority, are thought to be the worst committed since the Nazi holocaust.
