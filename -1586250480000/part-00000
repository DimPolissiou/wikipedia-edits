Also included (particularly in later versions) are numerous additional services and the tools to manage them, such as [[web server]], [[wiki]] server, chat server, calendar server, and many others.\n\n==Overview==\nMac OS X Server was provided as the operating system for [[Xserve]] computers, [[rack unit|rack mounted]] [[server (computing)|server computer]]s designed by Apple. Also, it was optionally [[pre-installed software|pre-installed]] on the [[Mac Mini]] and [[Mac Pro]] and was sold separately for use on any [[Macintosh]] computer meeting its minimum requirements.\n\nmacOS Server is based on an [[open-source software|open source]] foundation called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and uses open industry standards and protocols. It included services and applications for file sharing, sharing contact information and calendars, schedule events, send secure instant messages, conduct live video conferences, send and receive email, contribute to and comment in wikis, publish a company-wide blog, produce and distribute podcasts, and set up websites.\n\n==Versions==\n{{see also|macOS version history}}\n===Mac OS X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody)===\n{{Main article|Mac OS X Server 1.0}}\nThe first version of Mac OS X was [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]].

The [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] looked like a mixture of Mac OS 8's Platinum appearance with OPENSTEP's [[NeXT]]-based interface. It included a runtime layer called Blue Box for running legacy Mac OS-based applications within a separate window. There was discussion of implementing a 'transparent blue box' which would intermix Mac OS applications with those written for Rhapsody's Yellow Box environment, but this would not happen until [[macOS|Mac OS X]]'s Classic environment. Apple File Services, Macintosh Manager, QuickTime Streaming Server, [[WebObjects]], and [[NetBoot]] were included with Mac OS X Server 1.0 \u2013 1.2v3.

[[Synecdoche]] and [[metalepsis]] are considered specific types of metonymy. [[Polysemy]], multiple meanings of a single word or phrase, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. Both metonymy and [[metaphor]] involve the substitution of one term for another.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dirven|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=P\u00f6rings|first2=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Raqw1erGJcQC|year=2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017373-4}}</ref> In metaphor, this substitution is based on some specific [[analogy]] between two things, whereas in metonymy the substitution is based on some understood association or [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=Sex, Ecology, Spirituality|url=https://archive.org/details/sexecologyspirit00wilb_0|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2108-8}}</ref><ref name=\"tompkins and lawley\">{{cite web|last=Tompkins|first=Penny|author2=James Lawley|title=Metonymy and Part-Whole Relationships|url=http://www.cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/210/1/Metonymy--Part-Whole-Relationships/Page1.html|publisher=www.cleanlanguage.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAmerican literary theorist [[Kenneth Burke]] considers metonymy as one of four \"master [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\": [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]], and [[irony]]. He discusses them in particular ways in his book ''[[A Grammar of Motives]]''. Whereas [[Roman Jakobson]] argued that the fundamental dichotomy in trope was between metaphor and metonymy, Burke claims that the fundamental dichotomy is between irony and synecdoche, which he also describes as the dichotomy between dialectic and representation, or again between reduction and perspective.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Grammar_of_Motives.html?id=m_BUlVZjxKEC Burke, Kenneth. (1945) ''A Grammar of Motives''.] New York: Prentice Hall Inc. pp. 503\u201309.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its use in everyday speech, metonymy is a figure of speech in some [[poetry]] and in much [[rhetoric]]. Greek and Latin scholars of rhetoric made significant contributions to the study of metonymy.\n\n==Meaning relationships==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Synecdoche]], in which a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Sometimes an absolute distinction is made between a metonymy and a synecdoche, treating metonymy as different from, rather than inclusive of, synecdoche. There is a similar problem with the terms [[simile]] and metaphor.\n\nWhen the distinction is made, it is the following: when \"A\" is used to refer to \"B\", it is a synecdoche if A is a component of B or if B is a component of A, and a metonym if A is commonly associated with B but not part of its whole or a whole of its part. Thus, \"twenty thousand hungry mouths to feed\" is a synecdoche because mouths (A) are a part of the people (B) referred to. \"[[United States|America]] votes\" is also a synecdoche because America is a whole of which the people who voted are a part. On the other hand, \"The [[White House]] said\" is metonymy, but not synecdoche, for the [[president of the United States]] and his staff, because, although the White House is associated with the president and his staff, the building is not a part of the people.\n\nSimilarly, [[metalepsis]] is closely related to and sometimes understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Metalepsis is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase from figurative speech is used in a new context. The new figure of speech refers to an existing one.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=A Map of Misreading|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516221-9}}</ref> For example, in the idiom \"lead foot\", meaning someone who drives fast, [[lead]] is a heavy substance, and a heavy foot on the [[Throttle|accelerator pedal]] would cause a vehicle to go quickly. The use of \"lead foot\" to describe a person follows the intermediate substitution of \"lead\" for \"heavy\".<ref>{{cite web|title=metalepsis|work=Silva Rhetoricae|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/m/metalepsis.htm|accessdate=2013-12-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816080831/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/M/metalepsis.htm|archivedate=2013-08-16}}</ref> The figure of speech is a \"metonymy of a metonymy\".<ref name=\"Bloom\" />\n\nThe concept of metonymy also informs the nature of [[polysemy]], i.e., how the same phonological form (word) has different semantic mappings (meanings). If the two meanings are unrelated, as in the word ''pen'' meaning both ''writing instrument'' and ''enclosure'', they are considered [[homonym]]s. Within logical polysemies, a large class of mappings may be considered to be a case of metonymic transfer (e.g., \"chicken\" for the bird, as well as its meat; \"crown\" for the object, as well as the institution). Other cases where the meaning is polysemous, however, may turn out to be more metaphorical, e.g., \"eye\" as in the \"eye of the needle\".\n\n===Metaphor and metonymy===\n{{main|Metaphor and metonymy}}\nMetonymy works by the [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]] (association) between two concepts, whereas the term \"metaphor\" is based upon their analogous similarity. When people use metonymy, they do not typically wish to transfer qualities from one referent to another as they do with metaphor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Rhetorical Tropes|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem07.html|work=Semiotics for Beginners|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> There is nothing press-like about reporters or crown-like about a monarch, but \"the press\" and \"the crown\" are both common metonyms. Some uses of figurative language may be understood as both metonymy and metaphor; for example, the relationship between \"a crown\" and a \"king\" could be interpreted metaphorically (i.e., the king, like his gold crown, could be seemingly stiff yet ultimately malleable, over-ornate, and consistently immobile).\n\nTwo examples using the term \"fishing\" help clarify the distinction.<ref>Example drawn from Dirven, 1996</ref> The phrase \"to fish pearls\" uses metonymy, drawing from \"fishing\" the idea of taking things from the ocean. What is carried across from \"fishing fish\" to \"fishing pearls\" is the domain of metonymy. In contrast, the metaphorical phrase \"fishing for information\" transfers the concept of fishing into a new domain. If someone is \"fishing\" for information, we do not imagine that the person is anywhere near the ocean; rather, we transpose elements of the action of fishing (waiting, hoping to catch something that cannot be seen, probing) into a new domain (a conversation). Thus, metaphor works by presenting a target set of meanings and using them to suggest a similarity between items, actions, or events in two domains, whereas metonymy calls up or references a specific domain (here, removing items from the sea).\n\nSometimes, metaphor and metonymy may both be at work in the same figure of speech, or one could interpret a phrase metaphorically or metonymically. For example, the phrase \"[[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears|lend me your ear]]\" could be analyzed in a number of ways. One could imagine the following interpretations:\n\n*Analyze \"ear\" metonymically first \u2013 \"ear\" means \"attention\" (because people use ears to pay attention to each other's speech). Now, when we hear the phrase \"Talk to him; you have his ear\", it symbolizes he will listen to you or that he will pay attention to you. Another phrase \"lending an ear (attention)\", we stretch the base meaning of \"lend\" (to let someone borrow an object) to include the \"lending\" of non-material things (attention), but, beyond this slight extension of the verb, no metaphor is at work.\n*Imagine the whole phrase literally \u2013 imagine that the speaker literally borrows the listener's ear as a physical object (and the person's head with it). Then the speaker has temporary possession of the listener's ear, so the listener has granted the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears. The phrase \"lend me your ear\" is interpreted to metaphorically mean that the speaker wants the listener to grant the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears.\n*First, analyze the [[verb phrase]] \"lend me your ear\" metaphorically to mean \"turn your ear in my direction,\" since it is known that, literally lending a body part is nonsensical. Then, analyze the motion of ears metonymically \u2013 we associate \"turning ears\" with \"paying attention,\" which is what the speaker wants the listeners to do.\n\nIt is difficult to say which analysis above most closely represents the way a listener interprets the expression, and it is possible that different listeners analyse the phrase in different ways, or even in different ways at different times. Regardless, all three analyses yield the same interpretation. Thus, metaphor and metonymy, though different in their mechanism, work together seamlessly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geeraerts|first=Dirk|editor=R. Dirven and R.

For example, \u201ctongues\u201d is a metonym for languages in 1 Cor. 12:30, and \u201csleep\u201d is a metonym for Lazarus\u2019 death in John 11:11.<ref>[[James L. Resseguie]], ''Narrative Criticism: An Introduction'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 61.</ref> In the Hebrew Bible, \u201cfire\u201d is a metonymic image for Samson\u2019s uncontrollable rage.<ref>Robert Alter, ''The Art of Biblical Narrative'' (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 95.</ref> He snaps cords with his strength, which are likened to flax dissolved in fire (Judg. 15:14), and sets the Philistines\u2019 fields on fire (Judg. 15:4-5).\n\n===Examples===\n{{Main|List of metonyms}}\nHere are some broad kinds of relationships where metonymy is frequently used:\n*Containment: When one thing contains another, it can frequently be used metonymically, as when \"dish\" is used to refer not to a plate but to the food it contains, or as when the name of a building is used to refer to the entity it contains, as when \"the [[White House]]\" or \"[[the Pentagon]]\" are used to refer to the U.S. presidential staff or the military leadership, respectively.\n* A physical item, place, or body part used to refer to a related concept, such as \"the bench\" for the judicial profession, \"stomach\" or \"belly\" for appetite or hunger, \"mouth\" for speech, various terms{{which|date=January 2020}} for the genitalia for sexual desire or satisfaction of said desire, being \"in diapers\" for infancy, \"palate\" for taste, \"the altar\" or \"the aisle\" for marriage, \"hand\" for someone's responsibility for something (\"he had a hand in it\"), \"head\" or \"brain\" for mind or intelligence, or \"nose\" for concern about someone else's affairs, (as in \"keep your nose out of my business\"). A reference to [[Timbuktu]], as in \"from here to Timbuktu,\" usually means a place or idea is too far away or mysterious. Metonymy of objects or body parts for concepts is common in dreams.<ref>Blechner, M. J. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams''. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n*Tools/instruments: Often a tool is used to signify the job it does or the person who does the job, as in the phrase \"his Rolodex is long and valuable\" (referring to the Rolodex instrument, which keeps contact business cards ... meaning he has a lot of contacts and knows many people). Also \"the press\" (referring to the printing press), or as in the proverb, \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\"\n*Product for process: This is a type of metonymy where the product of the activity stands for the activity itself. For example, in \"The book is moving right along,\" ''the book'' refers to the process of writing or publishing.<ref>Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 203</ref>\n*Punctuation marks often stand metonymically for a meaning expressed by the punctuation mark. For example, \"He's a big ''question mark'' to me\" indicates that something is unknown.<ref>Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 245</ref> In the same way, 'period' can be used to emphasise that a point is concluded or not to be challenged.\n*[[Synecdoche]]: A part of something is often used for the whole, as when people refer to \"head\" of cattle or assistants are referred to as \"hands.\" An example of this is the [[Canadian dollar]], referred to as the [[loonie]] for the image of a bird on the one-dollar coin. [[United States one hundred-dollar bill]]s are often referred to as \"Bens\", \"Benjamins\" or \"Franklins\" because they bear a portrait of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Also, the whole of something is used for a part, as when people refer to a municipal employee as \"the council\" or police officers as \"the law\".\n*[[Toponym]]s: A country's [[capital city]] or some location within the city is frequently used as a metonym for the country's government, such as [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States; [[Ottawa]] in Canada; [[Tokyo]] in [[Japan]]; [[New Delhi]] in [[India]]; [[Downing Street]] or [[Whitehall]] in the [[United Kingdom]]; and the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in [[Russia]]. Similarly, other important places, such as [[Wall Street]], [[Madison Avenue]], [[Silicon Valley]], [[Hollywood]], [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], and [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]] are commonly used to refer to the industries that are located there ([[finance]], [[advertising]], [[high tech]]nology, [[Cinema of the United States|entertainment]], [[gambling]], and [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|motor vehicles]], respectively). Such usage may persist even when the industries in question have moved elsewhere, for example, ''[[Fleet Street]]'' continues to be used as a metonymy for the British national [[journalism|press]], though it is no longer located in the physical street of that name.\n\n====Places and institutions====\nA place is often used as a metonym for a government or other official institutions, for example, [[Brussels]] for the [[institutions of the European Union]], [[The Hague]] for the [[International Court of Justice]] or [[International Criminal Court]], [[Nairobi]] for the [[government of Kenya]], the [[White House]] and [[Capitol Hill]] for the executive and legislative branches, respectively, of the United States federal government, or [[Foggy Bottom]] for the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]]. A place can represent an entire industry: for instance, [[Wall Street]] is often used metonymically to describe the entire U.S. [[financial center|financial and corporate banking sector]].<ref name=\"gibbs jr.\">{{cite book|last=Gibbs, Jr.|first=Raymond W.|title=\"Speaking and Thinking with Metonymy\", in ''Pattern and Process: A Whiteheadian Perspective on Linguistics, ed.

A. Al-Sharafi supports this concept in his book ''Textual Metonymy'', \"Greek rhetorical scholarship at one time became entirely poetic scholarship.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\">{{cite book|last=Al-Sharafi|first=Abdul Gabbar|title=Textual Metonymy: A Semiotic Approach|year=2004|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/langling2004/browse/inside/9781403938909.html}}</ref> [[Philosopher]]s and rhetoricians thought that metaphors were the primary figurative language used in rhetoric.  Metaphors served as a better means to attract the audience\u2019s attention because the audience had to read between the lines in order to get an understanding of what the speaker was trying to say. Others did not think of metonymy as a good rhetorical method because metonymy did not involve symbolism. Al-Sharafi explains, \"This is why they undermined practical and purely referential discourse because it was seen as banal and not containing anything new, strange or shocking.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/>\n\nGreek scholars contributed to the definition of metonymy. For example, [[Isocrates]] worked to define the difference between poetic language and non-poetic language by saying that, \"Prose writers are handicapped in this regard because their discourse has to conform to the forms and terms used by the citizens and to those arguments which are precise and relevant to the subject-matter.\" In other words, Isocrates proposes here that metaphor is a distinctive feature of poetic language because it conveys the experience of the world afresh and provides a kind of defamiliarisation in the way the citizens perceive the world.<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> [[Democritus]] described metonymy by saying, \"Metonymy, that is the fact that words and meaning change.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/>  [[Aristotle]] discussed different definitions of metaphor, regarding one type as what we know to be metonymy today.\n\nLatin scholars also had an influence on metonymy. The treatise ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' states metonymy as, \"the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> The author describes the process of metonymy to us saying that we first figure out what a word means. We then figure out that word\u2019s relationship with other words. We understand and then call the word by a name that it is associated with. \"Perceived as such then metonymy will be a figure of speech in which there is a process of abstracting a relation of proximity between two words to the extent that one will be used in place of another.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> [[Cicero]] viewed metonymy as more of a stylish rhetorical method and described it as being based on words, but motivated by style.\n\n==Jakobson, structuralism, and realism==\nMetonymy became important in French [[structuralism]] through the work of [[Roman Jakobson]]. In his 1956 essay \"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\", Jakobson relates metonymy to the linguistic practice of [syntagmatic] combination and to the literary practice of [[literary realism|realism]]. He explains:\n<blockquote>The primacy of the metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism and symbolism has been repeatedly acknowledged, but it is still insufficiently realized that it is the predominance of metonymy which underlies and actually predetermines the so-called 'realistic' trend, which belongs to an intermediary stage between the decline of Romanticism and the rise of symbolism and is opposed to both.  Following the path of contiguous relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time.  He is fond of synecdochic details.  In the scene of [[Anna Karenina]]'s suicide Tolstoy's artistic attention is focused on the heroine's handbag; and in ''[[War and Peace]]'' the synecdoches \"hair on the upper lip\" or \"bare shoulders\" are used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these features belong.<ref name=\"Poles\">{{cite book|last1=Jakobson|first1=Roman|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=Ren\u00e9|editor2-last=P\u00f6rings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=1956 |publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=41\u201348|edition=revised|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&pg=PA41&dq=jakobson+metonymy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT_9qM0NrMAhVB6CYKHdx-AMoQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=jakobson%20metonymy&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJakobson's theories were important for [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and others.<ref name=\"Dirven\">{{cite book|last1=Dirven|first1=Ren\u00e9|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=Ren\u00e9|editor2-last=P\u00f6rings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=2003|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=75\u2013112|edition=revised|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=syntagm+metonymy&source=bl&ots=JAz4IBKLAi&sig=0BVE1lQtLvFUsrRKsqAmYA_98rE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0idynydrMAhXBTSYKHf7sD2oQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=syntagm%20metonymy&f=false|accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=Metonymy and Metaphor: Different Mental Strategies of Conceptualisation}}</ref>\n\nDreams can use metonyms.<ref>Blechner, M.

For example, [[Roman Jakobson]]<ref>Jakobson, R. (1971) ''Selected Writings: Word and Language, Vol 2.''

For example, [[Mir\u00f3]]\u2019s 1925 painting \"Photo: This is the Color of My Dreams\" has the word \u201cphoto\u201d to represent the image of his dreams.

[[Picasso]], in his 1911 painting \"Pipe Rack and Still Life on Table\" inserts the word \u201cOcean\u201d rather than painting an ocean: These paintings by Mir\u00f3 and Picasso are, in a sense, the reverse of a [[rebus]]: the word stands for the picture, instead of the picture standing for the word.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[-onym]]\n* [[Antonomasia]]\n* [[Deferred reference]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Eggcorn]]\n* [[Eponym]]\n* [[Enthymeme]]\n* [[Euphemism]] by comparison\n* [[Generic trademark]]\n* [[Kenning]]\n* [[Meronymy]]\n* [[Newspeak]]\n* [[Pars pro toto]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Slang]]\n* [[Sobriquet]]\n* [[Social stereotype]]\n* [[Totum pro parte]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Blank|first=Andreas|title=Prinzipien des lexikalischen Bedeutungswandels am Beispiel der romanischen Sprachen|year=1997|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-093160-0}}\n* {{cite book | last = Corbett | first = Edward P.J. | title = Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location  = New York | year =1998 | origyear  = 1971 | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-0-19-511542-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dirven|first=Ren\u00e9|editor=K.U.

[[Synecdoche]] and [[metalepsis]] are considered specific types of metonymy. [[Polysemy]], multiple meanings of a single word or phrase, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. Both metonymy and [[metaphor]] involve the substitution of one term for another.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dirven|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=P\u00f6rings|first2=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Raqw1erGJcQC|year=2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017373-4}}</ref> In metaphor, this substitution is based on some specific [[analogy]] between two things, whereas in metonymy the substitution is based on some understood association or [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=Sex, Ecology, Spirituality|url=https://archive.org/details/sexecologyspirit00wilb_0|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2108-8}}</ref><ref name=\"tompkins and lawley\">{{cite web|last=Tompkins|first=Penny|author2=James Lawley|title=Metonymy and Part-Whole Relationships|url=http://www.cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/210/1/Metonymy--Part-Whole-Relationships/Page1.html|publisher=www.cleanlanguage.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAmerican literary theorist [[Kenneth Burke]] considers metonymy as one of four \"master [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\": [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]], and [[irony]]. He discusses them in particular ways in his book ''[[A Grammar of Motives]]''. Whereas [[Roman Jakobson]] argued that the fundamental dichotomy in trope was between metaphor and metonymy, Burke claims that the fundamental dichotomy is between irony and synecdoche, which he also describes as the dichotomy between dialectic and representation, or again between reduction and perspective.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Grammar_of_Motives.html?id=m_BUlVZjxKEC Burke, Kenneth. (1945) ''A Grammar of Motives''.] New York: Prentice Hall Inc. pp. 503\u201309.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its use in everyday speech, metonymy is a figure of speech in some [[poetry]] and in much [[rhetoric]]. Greek and Latin scholars of rhetoric made significant contributions to the study of metonymy.\n\n==Meaning relationships==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Synecdoche]], in which a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Sometimes an absolute distinction is made between a metonymy and a synecdoche, treating metonymy as different from, rather than inclusive of, synecdoche. There is a similar problem with the terms [[simile]] and metaphor.\n\nWhen the distinction is made, it is the following: when \"A\" is used to refer to \"B\", it is a synecdoche if A is a component of B or if B is a component of A, and a metonym if A is commonly associated with B but not part of its whole or a whole of its part. Thus, \"twenty thousand hungry mouths to feed\" is a synecdoche because mouths (A) are a part of the people (B) referred to. \"[[United States|America]] votes\" is also a synecdoche because America is a whole of which the people who voted are a part. On the other hand, \"The [[White House]] said\" is metonymy, but not synecdoche, for the [[president of the United States]] and his staff, because, although the White House is associated with the president and his staff, the building is not a part of the people.\n\nSimilarly, [[metalepsis]] is closely related to and sometimes understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Metalepsis is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase from figurative speech is used in a new context. The new figure of speech refers to an existing one.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=A Map of Misreading|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516221-9}}</ref> For example, in the idiom \"lead foot\", meaning someone who drives fast, [[lead]] is a heavy substance, and a heavy foot on the [[Throttle|accelerator pedal]] would cause a vehicle to go quickly. The use of \"lead foot\" to describe a person follows the intermediate substitution of \"lead\" for \"heavy\".<ref>{{cite web|title=metalepsis|work=Silva Rhetoricae|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/m/metalepsis.htm|accessdate=2013-12-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816080831/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/M/metalepsis.htm|archivedate=2013-08-16}}</ref> The figure of speech is a \"metonymy of a metonymy\".<ref name=\"Bloom\" />\n\nThe concept of metonymy also informs the nature of [[polysemy]], i.e., how the same phonological form (word) has different semantic mappings (meanings). If the two meanings are unrelated, as in the word ''pen'' meaning both ''writing instrument'' and ''enclosure'', they are considered [[homonym]]s. Within logical polysemies, a large class of mappings may be considered to be a case of metonymic transfer (e.g., \"chicken\" for the bird, as well as its meat; \"crown\" for the object, as well as the institution). Other cases where the meaning is polysemous, however, may turn out to be more metaphorical, e.g., \"eye\" as in the \"eye of the needle\".\n\n===Metaphor and metonymy===\n{{main|Metaphor and metonymy}}\nMetonymy works by the [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]] (association) between two concepts, whereas the term \"metaphor\" is based upon their analogous similarity. When people use metonymy, they do not typically wish to transfer qualities from one referent to another as they do with metaphor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Rhetorical Tropes|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem07.html|work=Semiotics for Beginners|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> There is nothing press-like about reporters or crown-like about a monarch, but \"the press\" and \"the crown\" are both common metonyms. Some uses of figurative language may be understood as both metonymy and metaphor; for example, the relationship between \"a crown\" and a \"king\" could be interpreted metaphorically (i.e., the king, like his gold crown, could be seemingly stiff yet ultimately malleable, over-ornate, and consistently immobile).\n\nTwo examples using the term \"fishing\" help clarify the distinction.<ref>Example drawn from Dirven, 1996</ref> The phrase \"to fish pearls\" uses metonymy, drawing from \"fishing\" the idea of taking things from the ocean. What is carried across from \"fishing fish\" to \"fishing pearls\" is the domain of metonymy. In contrast, the metaphorical phrase \"fishing for information\" transfers the concept of fishing into a new domain. If someone is \"fishing\" for information, we do not imagine that the person is anywhere near the ocean; rather, we transpose elements of the action of fishing (waiting, hoping to catch something that cannot be seen, probing) into a new domain (a conversation). Thus, metaphor works by presenting a target set of meanings and using them to suggest a similarity between items, actions, or events in two domains, whereas metonymy calls up or references a specific domain (here, removing items from the sea).\n\nSometimes, metaphor and metonymy may both be at work in the same figure of speech, or one could interpret a phrase metaphorically or metonymically. For example, the phrase \"[[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears|lend me your ear]]\" could be analyzed in a number of ways. One could imagine the following interpretations:\n\n*Analyze \"ear\" metonymically first \u2013 \"ear\" means \"attention\" (because people use ears to pay attention to each other's speech). Now, when we hear the phrase \"Talk to him; you have his ear\", it symbolizes he will listen to you or that he will pay attention to you. Another phrase \"lending an ear (attention)\", we stretch the base meaning of \"lend\" (to let someone borrow an object) to include the \"lending\" of non-material things (attention), but, beyond this slight extension of the verb, no metaphor is at work.\n*Imagine the whole phrase literally \u2013 imagine that the speaker literally borrows the listener's ear as a physical object (and the person's head with it). Then the speaker has temporary possession of the listener's ear, so the listener has granted the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears. We then interpret the phrase \"lend me your ear\" metaphorically to mean that the speaker wants the listener to grant the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears.\n*First, analyze the [[verb phrase]] \"lend me your ear\" metaphorically to mean \"turn your ear in my direction,\" since we know that, literally, lending a body part is nonsensical. Then, analyze the motion of ears metonymically \u2013 we associate \"turning ears\" with \"paying attention,\" which is what the speaker wants the listeners to do.\n\nIt is difficult to say which analysis above most closely represents the way a listener interprets the expression, and it is possible that different listeners analyse the phrase in different ways, or even in different ways at different times. Regardless, all three analyses yield the same interpretation. Thus, metaphor and metonymy, though different in their mechanism, work together seamlessly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geeraerts|first=Dirk|editor=R. Dirven and R.

For example, \u201ctongues\u201d is a metonym for languages in 1 Cor. 12:30, and \u201csleep\u201d is a metonym for Lazarus\u2019 death in John 11:11.<ref>[[James L. Resseguie]], ''Narrative Criticism: An Introduction'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 61.</ref> In the Hebrew Bible, \u201cfire\u201d is a metonymic image for Samson\u2019s uncontrollable rage.<ref>Robert Alter, ''The Art of Biblical Narrative'' (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 95.</ref> He snaps cords with his strength, which are likened to flax dissolved in fire (Judg. 15:14), and sets the Philistines\u2019 fields on fire (Judg. 15:4-5).\n\n===Examples===\n{{Main|List of metonyms}}\nHere are some broad kinds of relationships where metonymy is frequently used:\n*Containment: When one thing contains another, it can frequently be used metonymically, as when \"dish\" is used to refer not to a plate but to the food it contains, or as when the name of a building is used to refer to the entity it contains, as when \"the [[White House]]\" or \"[[the Pentagon]]\" are used to refer to the U.S. presidential staff or the military leadership, respectively.\n* A physical item, place, or body part used to refer to a related concept, such as \"the bench\" for the judicial profession, \"stomach\" or \"belly\" for appetite or hunger, \"mouth\" for speech, various terms{{which|date=January 2020}} for the genitalia for sexual desire or satisfaction of said desire, being \"in diapers\" for infancy, \"palate\" for taste, \"the altar\" or \"the aisle\" for marriage, \"hand\" for someone's responsibility for something (\"he had a hand in it\"), \"head\" or \"brain\" for mind or intelligence, or \"nose\" for concern about someone else's affairs, (as in \"keep your nose out of my business\"). A reference to [[Timbuktu]], as in \"from here to Timbuktu,\" usually means a place or idea is too far away or mysterious. Metonymy of objects or body parts for concepts is common in dreams.<ref>Blechner, M. J. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams''. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n*Tools/instruments: Often a tool is used to signify the job it does or the person who does the job, as in the phrase \"his Rolodex is long and valuable\" (referring to the Rolodex instrument, which keeps contact business cards ... meaning he has a lot of contacts and knows many people). Also \"the press\" (referring to the printing press), or as in the proverb, \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\"\n*Product for process: This is a type of metonymy where the product of the activity stands for the activity itself. For example, in \"The book is moving right along,\" ''the book'' refers to the process of writing or publishing.<ref>Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 203</ref>\n*Punctuation marks often stand metonymically for a meaning expressed by the punctuation mark. For example, \"He's a big ''question mark'' to me\" indicates that something is unknown.<ref>Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 245</ref> In the same way, 'period' can be used to emphasise that a point is concluded or not to be challenged.\n*[[Synecdoche]]: A part of something is often used for the whole, as when people refer to \"head\" of cattle or assistants are referred to as \"hands.\" An example of this is the [[Canadian dollar]], referred to as the [[loonie]] for the image of a bird on the one-dollar coin. [[United States one hundred-dollar bill]]s are often referred to as \"Bens\", \"Benjamins\" or \"Franklins\" because they bear a portrait of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Also, the whole of something is used for a part, as when people refer to a municipal employee as \"the council\" or police officers as \"the law\".\n*[[Toponym]]s: A country's [[capital city]] or some location within the city is frequently used as a metonym for the country's government, such as [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States; [[Ottawa]] in Canada; [[Tokyo]] in [[Japan]]; [[New Delhi]] in [[India]]; [[Downing Street]] or [[Whitehall]] in the [[United Kingdom]]; and the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in [[Russia]]. Similarly, other important places, such as [[Wall Street]], [[Madison Avenue]], [[Silicon Valley]], [[Hollywood]], [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], and [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]] are commonly used to refer to the industries that are located there ([[finance]], [[advertising]], [[high tech]]nology, [[Cinema of the United States|entertainment]], [[gambling]], and [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|motor vehicles]], respectively). Such usage may persist even when the industries in question have moved elsewhere, for example, ''[[Fleet Street]]'' continues to be used as a metonymy for the British national [[journalism|press]], though it is no longer located in the physical street of that name.\n\n====Places and institutions====\nA place is often used as a metonym for a government or other official institutions, for example, [[Brussels]] for the [[institutions of the European Union]], [[The Hague]] for the [[International Court of Justice]] or [[International Criminal Court]], [[Nairobi]] for the [[government of Kenya]], the [[White House]] and [[Capitol Hill]] for the executive and legislative branches, respectively, of the United States federal government, or [[Foggy Bottom]] for the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]]. A place can represent an entire industry: for instance, [[Wall Street]] is often used metonymically to describe the entire U.S. [[financial center|financial and corporate banking sector]].<ref name=\"gibbs jr.\">{{cite book|last=Gibbs, Jr.|first=Raymond W.|title=\"Speaking and Thinking with Metonymy\", in ''Pattern and Process: A Whiteheadian Perspective on Linguistics, ed.

A. Al-Sharafi supports this concept in his book ''Textual Metonymy'', \"Greek rhetorical scholarship at one time became entirely poetic scholarship.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\">{{cite book|last=Al-Sharafi|first=Abdul Gabbar|title=Textual Metonymy: A Semiotic Approach|year=2004|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/langling2004/browse/inside/9781403938909.html}}</ref> [[Philosopher]]s and rhetoricians thought that metaphors were the primary figurative language used in rhetoric.  Metaphors served as a better means to attract the audience\u2019s attention because the audience had to read between the lines in order to get an understanding of what the speaker was trying to say. Others did not think of metonymy as a good rhetorical method because metonymy did not involve symbolism. Al-Sharafi explains, \"This is why they undermined practical and purely referential discourse because it was seen as banal and not containing anything new, strange or shocking.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/>\n\nGreek scholars contributed to the definition of metonymy. For example, [[Isocrates]] worked to define the difference between poetic language and non-poetic language by saying that, \"Prose writers are handicapped in this regard because their discourse has to conform to the forms and terms used by the citizens and to those arguments which are precise and relevant to the subject-matter.\" In other words, Isocrates proposes here that metaphor is a distinctive feature of poetic language because it conveys the experience of the world afresh and provides a kind of defamiliarisation in the way the citizens perceive the world.<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> [[Democritus]] described metonymy by saying, \"Metonymy, that is the fact that words and meaning change.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/>  [[Aristotle]] discussed different definitions of metaphor, regarding one type as what we know to be metonymy today.\n\nLatin scholars also had an influence on metonymy. The treatise ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' states metonymy as, \"the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> The author describes the process of metonymy to us saying that we first figure out what a word means. We then figure out that word\u2019s relationship with other words. We understand and then call the word by a name that it is associated with. \"Perceived as such then metonymy will be a figure of speech in which there is a process of abstracting a relation of proximity between two words to the extent that one will be used in place of another.\"<ref name=\"Al-Sharafi 2004\"/> [[Cicero]] viewed metonymy as more of a stylish rhetorical method and described it as being based on words, but motivated by style.\n\n==Jakobson, structuralism, and realism==\nMetonymy became important in French [[structuralism]] through the work of [[Roman Jakobson]]. In his 1956 essay \"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\", Jakobson relates metonymy to the linguistic practice of [syntagmatic] combination and to the literary practice of [[literary realism|realism]]. He explains:\n<blockquote>The primacy of the metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism and symbolism has been repeatedly acknowledged, but it is still insufficiently realized that it is the predominance of metonymy which underlies and actually predetermines the so-called 'realistic' trend, which belongs to an intermediary stage between the decline of Romanticism and the rise of symbolism and is opposed to both.  Following the path of contiguous relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time.  He is fond of synecdochic details.  In the scene of [[Anna Karenina]]'s suicide Tolstoy's artistic attention is focused on the heroine's handbag; and in ''[[War and Peace]]'' the synecdoches \"hair on the upper lip\" or \"bare shoulders\" are used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these features belong.<ref name=\"Poles\">{{cite book|last1=Jakobson|first1=Roman|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=Ren\u00e9|editor2-last=P\u00f6rings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=1956 |publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=41\u201348|edition=revised|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&pg=PA41&dq=jakobson+metonymy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT_9qM0NrMAhVB6CYKHdx-AMoQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=jakobson%20metonymy&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJakobson's theories were important for [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and others.<ref name=\"Dirven\">{{cite book|last1=Dirven|first1=Ren\u00e9|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=Ren\u00e9|editor2-last=P\u00f6rings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=2003|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=75\u2013112|edition=revised|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=syntagm+metonymy&source=bl&ots=JAz4IBKLAi&sig=0BVE1lQtLvFUsrRKsqAmYA_98rE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0idynydrMAhXBTSYKHf7sD2oQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=syntagm%20metonymy&f=false|accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=Metonymy and Metaphor: Different Mental Strategies of Conceptualisation}}</ref>\n\nDreams can use metonyms.<ref>Blechner, M. J. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams: An Exploration of Thinking, Dreaming, and Artistic Creation.'' New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\n==Metonyms and art==\n\nMetonyms can also be wordless. For example, [[Roman Jakobson]]<ref>Jakobson, R. (1971) ''Selected Writings: Word and Language, Vol 2.'' The Hague: Mouton.</ref> argued that cubist art relied heavily on nonlinguistic metonyms, while surrealist art relied more on metaphors.\n\n[[Lakoff]] and Turner<ref>Lakoff, G. and Turner, M. (1989) ''More than Cool Reason: A Field Guide to Poetic Metaphor.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</ref> argued that all words are metonyms: \u201cWords stand for the concepts they express.\u201d Some artists have used actual words as metonyms in their paintings. For example, [[Mir\u00f3]]\u2019s 1925 painting \"Photo: This is the Color of My Dreams\" has the word \u201cphoto\u201d to represent the image of his dreams. This painting comes from a series of paintings called peintures-po\u00e9sies (paintings-poems) which reflect Mir\u00f3\u2019s interest in dreams and the subconscious<ref>Rowell, M. (1976) ''Joan Mir\u00f3: Peinture \u2013 Po\u00e9sie.'' Paris: \u00c9ditions de la diff\u00e9rence.</ref> and the relationship of words, images, and thoughts. [[Picasso]], in his 1911 painting \"Pipe Rack and Still Life on Table\" inserts the word \u201cOcean\u201d rather than painting an ocean: These paintings by Mir\u00f3 and Picasso are, in a sense, the reverse of a [[rebus]]: the word stands for the picture, instead of the picture standing for the word.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[-onym]]\n* [[Antonomasia]]\n* [[Deferred reference]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Eggcorn]]\n* [[Eponym]]\n* [[Enthymeme]]\n* [[Euphemism]] by comparison\n* [[Generic trademark]]\n* [[Kenning]]\n* [[Meronymy]]\n* [[Newspeak]]\n* [[Pars pro toto]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Slang]]\n* [[Sobriquet]]\n* [[Social stereotype]]\n* [[Totum pro parte]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Blank|first=Andreas|title=Prinzipien des lexikalischen Bedeutungswandels am Beispiel der romanischen Sprachen|year=1997|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-093160-0}}\n* {{cite book | last = Corbett | first = Edward P.J. | title = Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location  = New York | year =1998 | origyear  = 1971 | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-0-19-511542-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dirven|first=Ren\u00e9|editor=K.U.

Warbeck claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], who was the second son of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and one of the so-called \"[[Princes in the Tower]]\". Richard, were he alive, would have been the rightful claimant to the throne, assuming that his elder brother [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] was dead, and that he was [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] \u2013 a contentious point.\n\nDue to the uncertainty as to whether Richard had died (either of some natural cause or from having been murdered in the [[Tower of London]]) or whether he had somehow survived, Warbeck's claim gained some support. Followers may have truly believed Warbeck was Richard, or may have supported him simply because of their desire to overthrow the reigning king, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and reclaim the throne. Given the lack of knowledge regarding Richard's fate, and having received support outside England, Warbeck emerged as a significant threat to the newly established [[Tudor dynasty]]; Henry declared Warbeck an [[impostor]].\n\nWarbeck made several landings in England backed by small armies but met strong resistance from the King's men and surrendered in [[Hampshire]] in 1497. After his capture, he retracted his claim, writing a confession in which he said he was a [[Flemish people|Fleming]] born in [[Tournai]] around 1474. Dealing with Warbeck cost Henry VII over \u00a313,000 ({{Inflation|UK|13000|1499|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}), putting a strain on Henry's weak state finances.it is quite likely that this boy was truly Richard Duke of york\n\n==Early life==\nPerkin Warbeck's personal history is fraught with many unreliable and varying statements.<ref>Gairdner, James, p. 263</ref> Warbeck said that he was [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], the younger son of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], who had [[Princes in the Tower|disappeared mysteriously]] along with his brother [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] after [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] usurped the throne following the elder Edward's death in 1483. After Warbeck was captured and interrogated in 1497 under the eye of King Henry VII, another version of his life was published, based on his confession. This confession is considered by many historians to be possibly only partially true as it was procured under duress. According to the confession, Warbeck was born to a man called John Osbeck (also known as Jehan de Werbecque).<ref>Gairdner, James, p. 266</ref> Osbeck, who was married to Warbeck's mother Katherine de Faro, was Flemish and held the occupation of [[comptroller]] to the city of [[Tournai]], in present-day [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\">Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii</ref> These family ties are backed up by several municipal archives of Tournai which mention most of the people whom Warbeck declared he was related to.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\">Gairdner, James, p. 267</ref> He was taken to [[Antwerp]] by his mother at around age ten to learn [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. From here, he was undertaken by several masters around Antwerp and [[Middelburg]] before being employed by a local English merchant named John Strewe for a few months.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/>\n\nAfter his time in the Netherlands, Warbeck yearned to visit other countries and was hired by a Breton merchant.<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\"/> This merchant eventually brought Warbeck to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Kingdom of Desmond|Ireland]] in 1491 when he was about 17, and there he learned to speak English.<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\"/> Warbeck then claims that upon seeing him dressed in silk clothes, some of the citizens of Cork who were [[House of York|Yorkists]] demanded to do \"him the honour as a member of the Royal House of York.\"<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/> He said they did this because they were resolved in gaining revenge on the King of England; they decided that he would claim to be the younger son of the late King Edward IV.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/>\n\n==Claim to the English throne==\n\nWarbeck first claimed the English throne at the court of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1490, where [[jeton]] coins were minted for him. Warbeck explained his (i.e. Richard of Shrewsbury's) mysterious disappearance by claiming that his brother Edward V had been murdered, but he had been spared by his brother's (unidentified) murderers because of his age and \"innocence\". However, he had been made to swear an oath not to reveal his true identity for \"a certain number of years\".<ref name = \"ali\">Weir, Alison, p. 238-40</ref> From 1483 to 1490, he claimed he had lived on the continent of Europe under the protection of Yorkist loyalists, but when his main guardian, [[Sir Edward Brampton]], returned to England, he was left free. He then declared his true identity.<ref name = \"ali\" />\n\nIn 1491, Warbeck landed in [[Ireland]] in the hope of gaining support for his claim as [[Lambert Simnel]] had four years previously. His cause was promoted by [[John Atwater]], a former [[Mayor of Cork]] and ardent Yorkist, who may have been instrumental in helping him assume the identity of Richard. However, little support for an active rebellion was found and Warbeck was forced to return to mainland Europe. There his fortunes improved. He was first received by [[Charles VIII of France]], but in 1492 was expelled under the terms of the [[Treaty of Etaples]], by which Charles had agreed not to shelter rebels against Henry VII. Charles VIII agreed to withdraw all backing from Warbeck after an English expedition had [[Siege of Boulogne (1492)|laid siege to Boulogne]]. He was publicly recognized as Richard of Shrewsbury by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]], widow of [[Charles the Bold]], sister of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and thus the aunt of the Princes in the Tower. Whether Margaret \u2013 who left England to marry before either of her nephews were born \u2013 truly believed that the pretender was her nephew Richard, or whether she considered him a fraud but supported him anyway, is unknown, but she tutored him in the ways of the Yorkist court.\n\nHenry complained to [[Philip I of Castile|Philip of Habsburg]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], about the harbouring of the pretender, and, since he was ignored, imposed a trade embargo on Burgundy, cutting off important Burgundian trade connections with England. The pretender was also welcomed by various other monarchs and was known in international diplomacy as the [[Duke of York]]. At the invitation of Duke Philip's father, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Maximilian I]], in 1493, he attended the funeral of the [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]] and was recognised as King Richard IV of England.<ref>Wroe, Ann, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\n==Support in England (The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy)==\n\nPro-Yorkist sympathy in England involved important figures making it known that they were prepared to back Warbeck's claims. These included Lord Fitzwater, [[Simon de Montford|Sir Simon Montfort]], [[Thomas Thwaites|Sir Thomas Thwaites]] (ex-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] (the [[Lord Chamberlain]]) and Sir Robert Clifford. Clifford went over to mainland Europe and wrote back to his friends to confirm Warbeck's real identity as Prince Richard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsandladies.org/perkin-warbeck.htm|title= Perkin Warbeck|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKing Henry ordered the group of supporters to be rounded up and put on trial. All were duly arrested, together with William D'Aubeney, Thomas Cressener, Thomas Astwode, Robert Ratcliff and others. Lord Fitzwater was sent as a prisoner to Calais and later beheaded for trying to bribe his gaolers.\n\nIn show trials in January 1495 all the conspirators were initially condemned to death, although six, including Thwaites, were then pardoned and their sentences commuted to imprisonment and fines. Within days Sir Simon Montfort, Robert Ratcliff and William D'Aubeney were beheaded at [[Tower Hill]] and Cressener and Astwode pardoned at the block. Later the same month Sir William Stanley was also beheaded. Other members of the group were imprisoned and fined.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy| first=Ian|last=Arthurson}}</ref> Sir Robert Clifford was pardoned and rewarded for revealing the names of the conspirators.\n\n==First landing in England and support in Scotland (1495\u20131496)==\n\nOn 3 July 1495, funded by Margaret of Burgundy, Warbeck landed at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] in [[Kent]], hoping for a show of popular support. They were confronted by locals loyal to Henry VII in the ensuing [[Battle of Deal]]. Warbeck's small army was routed and 150 of the pretender's troops were killed without Warbeck even disembarking. He was forced to retreat almost immediately, this time to Ireland. There he found support from [[Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond]], and laid siege to [[Waterford]], but, meeting resistance, he fled to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Henry pardoned Warbeck's Irish supporters, remarking drily that   \"I suppose they will crown an ape next\".<ref>O'Shea, Joe  \"If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county?\"  ''Irish Independent''  4 August 2013</ref>\n\nWarbeck was well-received by [[James IV of Scotland]], who realised that his presence gave him international leverage. As [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain were negotiating an alliance with Henry VII, James IV knew that Spain would help him in his struggles with England in order to prevent the situation escalating into war with France.<ref name=macdougall>Macdougall, Norman p. 123-124, 136, 140\u2013141.</ref> Spanish ambassadors arrived in Edinburgh, and later [[Pedro de Ayala]] was established as a resident ambassador during the crisis. Warbeck married [[Lady Catherine Gordon]], a daughter of [[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]]. The marriage was celebrated in Edinburgh with a tournament. James gave Warbeck clothes for the wedding and armour covered with purple silk.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland''; 257, 262\u2013264</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Katie Stevenson (historian)|Katie Stevenson]] suggests the clothing bought for the tournament shows Warbeck fought in a team with the king and four knights.<ref>Stevenson, Katie, p. 84</ref> A copy of a love letter in Latin obtained by Pedro de Ayala is thought to be Warbeck's proposal to Lady Catherine.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=93373 ''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol. 1 (1862), no.119 & fn.]</ref> However, James' biographer [[Norman Macdougall]] comments that it is clear that nobody, with the possible exception of Margaret of Burgundy, took seriously his claim to be the prince; his marriage to a junior Scots noblewoman was scarcely what might be expected for a potential king of England.<ref name=macdougall />\n\nIn September 1496, James IV prepared to invade England with Warbeck. A red, gold and silver banner was made for Warbeck as the Duke of York; James's armour was gilded and painted; and the royal artillery was prepared.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', 292\u2013296.</ref> [[John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell|John Ramsay of Balmain]] (who called himself Lord Bothwell) described the events for Henry VII. He saw Roderic de Lalanne, a Flemish knight, arrive with two little ships and 60 German soldiers and meet James IV and talk to Warbeck. In Edinburgh Castle Ramsay saw two great French guns called 'curtalds,' 10 [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]] or little serpentines, and 30 iron breech loading 'cart guns' with 16 close-carts or wagons for the munitions. He estimated the invasion force would last only four to five days in England before it ran out of provisions. He suggested, from the safety of [[Berwick upon Tweed]], that the Scots could be vanquished by a modest English force attacking from north and south in a [[pincer movement]].<ref>Pinkerton, John, p. 438-441</ref>\n\nThe Scottish host assembled near Edinburgh and James IV and Warbeck offered prayers at [[Holyrood Abbey]] on 14 September, and on the next day at St Triduana's Chapel and Our Lady Kirk of [[Restalrig]].<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland''; 299\u2013300, 296.</ref> On 19 September the Scottish army was at Ellem and on 21 September 1496 they crossed the [[River Tweed]] at [[Coldstream]]. Miners set to work to demolish the tower of Hetoune (Castle Heaton) on 24 September, but the army quickly retreated when resources were expended,<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', 299\u2013300</ref> and hoped-for support for Perkin Warbeck in [[Northumberland]] failed to materialise. According to an English record, the Scots penetrated four miles into England with royal banner displayed, and destroyed three or four little towers (or [[Bastle house]]s). They left on 25 September 1496 when an English army commanded by [[Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland|Lord Neville]] approached from Newcastle.<ref>Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357\u20131509, vol. 4, HM Register House, Edinburgh (1888), no. 35, pp. 418\u20139, (there dated as if '1497'): David Dunlop (1991), 108\u20139 & fn., quotes another version, and cites four more, noting mistaken date in Bain (1888).</ref> When news of this invasion reached [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]], on 21 October 1496, he wrote to his ambassador in Spain, to request the Spanish monarchs make peace between England and Scotland. The peace mission was entrusted to [[Pedro de Ayala]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Milan\", (1912), no. 514.</ref>\n\nLater, wishing to be rid of Warbeck, James IV provided a ship called the ''Cuckoo'' and a hired crew under a Breton captain which returned Perkin to Waterford in shame in July 1497. James IV made peace with England by signing the [[Treaty of Ayton]] at [[Ayton Parish Church|St Dionysius's Church]] in [[Ayton, Scottish Borders|Ayton]] in [[Berwickshire]]. Once again Perkin attempted to lay siege to Waterford, but this time his effort lasted only eleven days before he was forced to flee Ireland, chased by four English ships. According to some sources, by this time he was left with only 120 men on two ships.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Second landing in England==\n{{Main|Second Cornish Uprising of 1497}}\n[[File:P102-Beaulieu Abby, where Perkin Warbeck took Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|[[Beaulieu Abbey]] in Hampshire, where Warbeck took sanctuary]]\n\nOn 7 September 1497, Warbeck landed at [[Whitesand Bay (Cornwall)|Whitesand Bay]], two miles north of [[Land's End]], in [[Cornwall]] hoping to capitalise on the [[Cornish people]]'s resentment in the aftermath of [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|their uprising]] only three months earlier.

As soon as he confessed to being an impostor, he was released from the Tower of London, and was given accommodation at Henry's court. He was even allowed to be present at royal banquets. He was, however, kept under guard and was not allowed to sleep with his wife, who was living under the protection of the queen.\n\nAfter 18 months at court, Warbeck tried to escape.

Warbeck claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], who was the second son of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and one of the so-called \"[[Princes in the Tower]]\". Richard, were he alive, would have been the rightful claimant to the throne, assuming that his elder brother [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] was dead, and that he was [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] \u2013 a contentious point.\n\nDue to the uncertainty as to whether Richard had died (either of some natural cause or from having been murdered in the [[Tower of London]]) or whether he had somehow survived, Warbeck's claim gained some support. Followers may have truly believed Warbeck was Richard, or may have supported him simply because of their desire to overthrow the reigning king, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and reclaim the throne. Given the lack of knowledge regarding Richard's fate, and having received support outside England, Warbeck emerged as a significant threat to the newly established [[Tudor dynasty]]; Henry declared Warbeck an [[impostor]].\n\nWarbeck made several landings in England backed by small armies but met strong resistance from the King's men and surrendered in [[Hampshire]] in 1497. After his capture, he retracted his claim, writing a confession in which he said he was a [[Flemish people|Fleming]] born in [[Tournai]] around 1474. Dealing with Warbeck cost Henry VII over \u00a313,000 ({{Inflation|UK|13000|1499|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}), putting a strain on Henry's weak state finances.\n\n==Early life==\nPerkin Warbeck's personal history is fraught with many unreliable and varying statements.<ref>Gairdner, James, p. 263</ref> Warbeck said that he was [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], the younger son of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], who had [[Princes in the Tower|disappeared mysteriously]] along with his brother [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] after [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] usurped the throne following the elder Edward's death in 1483. After Warbeck was captured and interrogated in 1497 under the eye of King Henry VII, another version of his life was published, based on his confession. This confession is considered by many historians to be possibly only partially true as it was procured under duress. According to the confession, Warbeck was born to a man called John Osbeck (also known as Jehan de Werbecque).<ref>Gairdner, James, p. 266</ref> Osbeck, who was married to Warbeck's mother Katherine de Faro, was Flemish and held the occupation of [[comptroller]] to the city of [[Tournai]], in present-day [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\">Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii</ref> These family ties are backed up by several municipal archives of Tournai which mention most of the people whom Warbeck declared he was related to.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\">Gairdner, James, p. 267</ref> He was taken to [[Antwerp]] by his mother at around age ten to learn [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. From here, he was undertaken by several masters around Antwerp and [[Middelburg]] before being employed by a local English merchant named John Strewe for a few months.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/>\n\nAfter his time in the Netherlands, Warbeck yearned to visit other countries and was hired by a Breton merchant.<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\"/> This merchant eventually brought Warbeck to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Kingdom of Desmond|Ireland]] in 1491 when he was about 17, and there he learned to speak English.<ref name=\"Ure, Peter, ed., p. lxxxviii\"/> Warbeck then claims that upon seeing him dressed in silk clothes, some of the citizens of Cork who were [[House of York|Yorkists]] demanded to do \"him the honour as a member of the Royal House of York.\"<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/> He said they did this because they were resolved in gaining revenge on the King of England; they decided that he would claim to be the younger son of the late King Edward IV.<ref name=\"Gairdner, James, p. 267\"/>\n\n==Claim to the English throne==\n\nWarbeck first claimed the English throne at the court of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1490, where [[jeton]] coins were minted for him. Warbeck explained his (i.e. Richard of Shrewsbury's) mysterious disappearance by claiming that his brother Edward V had been murdered, but he had been spared by his brother's (unidentified) murderers because of his age and \"innocence\". However, he had been made to swear an oath not to reveal his true identity for \"a certain number of years\".<ref name = \"ali\">Weir, Alison, p. 238-40</ref> From 1483 to 1490, he claimed he had lived on the continent of Europe under the protection of Yorkist loyalists, but when his main guardian, [[Sir Edward Brampton]], returned to England, he was left free. He then declared his true identity.<ref name = \"ali\" />\n\nIn 1491, Warbeck landed in [[Ireland]] in the hope of gaining support for his claim as [[Lambert Simnel]] had four years previously. His cause was promoted by [[John Atwater]], a former [[Mayor of Cork]] and ardent Yorkist, who may have been instrumental in helping him assume the identity of Richard. However, little support for an active rebellion was found and Warbeck was forced to return to mainland Europe. There his fortunes improved. He was first received by [[Charles VIII of France]], but in 1492 was expelled under the terms of the [[Treaty of Etaples]], by which Charles had agreed not to shelter rebels against Henry VII. Charles VIII agreed to withdraw all backing from Warbeck after an English expedition had [[Siege of Boulogne (1492)|laid siege to Boulogne]]. He was publicly recognized as Richard of Shrewsbury by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]], widow of [[Charles the Bold]], sister of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and thus the aunt of the Princes in the Tower. Whether Margaret \u2013 who left England to marry before either of her nephews were born \u2013 truly believed that the pretender was her nephew Richard, or whether she considered him a fraud but supported him anyway, is unknown, but she tutored him in the ways of the Yorkist court.\n\nHenry complained to [[Philip I of Castile|Philip of Habsburg]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], about the harbouring of the pretender, and, since he was ignored, imposed a trade embargo on Burgundy, cutting off important Burgundian trade connections with England. The pretender was also welcomed by various other monarchs and was known in international diplomacy as the [[Duke of York]]. At the invitation of Duke Philip's father, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Maximilian I]], in 1493, he attended the funeral of the [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]] and was recognised as King Richard IV of England.<ref>Wroe, Ann, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\n==Support in England (The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy)==\n\nPro-Yorkist sympathy in England involved important figures making it known that they were prepared to back Warbeck's claims. These included Lord Fitzwater, [[Simon de Montford|Sir Simon Montfort]], [[Thomas Thwaites|Sir Thomas Thwaites]] (ex-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] (the [[Lord Chamberlain]]) and Sir Robert Clifford. Clifford went over to mainland Europe and wrote back to his friends to confirm Warbeck's real identity as Prince Richard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsandladies.org/perkin-warbeck.htm|title= Perkin Warbeck|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKing Henry ordered the group of supporters to be rounded up and put on trial. All were duly arrested, together with William D'Aubeney, Thomas Cressener, Thomas Astwode, Robert Ratcliff and others. Lord Fitzwater was sent as a prisoner to Calais and later beheaded for trying to bribe his gaolers.\n\nIn show trials in January 1495 all the conspirators were initially condemned to death, although six, including Thwaites, were then pardoned and their sentences commuted to imprisonment and fines. Within days Sir Simon Montfort, Robert Ratcliff and William D'Aubeney were beheaded at [[Tower Hill]] and Cressener and Astwode pardoned at the block. Later the same month Sir William Stanley was also beheaded. Other members of the group were imprisoned and fined.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy| first=Ian|last=Arthurson}}</ref> Sir Robert Clifford was pardoned and rewarded for revealing the names of the conspirators.\n\n==First landing in England and support in Scotland (1495\u20131496)==\n\nOn 3 July 1495, funded by Margaret of Burgundy, Warbeck landed at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] in [[Kent]], hoping for a show of popular support. They were confronted by locals loyal to Henry VII in the ensuing [[Battle of Deal]]. Warbeck's small army was routed and 150 of the pretender's troops were killed without Warbeck even disembarking. He was forced to retreat almost immediately, this time to Ireland. There he found support from [[Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond]], and laid siege to [[Waterford]], but, meeting resistance, he fled to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Henry pardoned Warbeck's Irish supporters, remarking drily that   \"I suppose they will crown an ape next\".<ref>O'Shea, Joe  \"If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county?\"  ''Irish Independent''  4 August 2013</ref>\n\nWarbeck was well-received by [[James IV of Scotland]], who realised that his presence gave him international leverage. As [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain were negotiating an alliance with Henry VII, James IV knew that Spain would help him in his struggles with England in order to prevent the situation escalating into war with France.<ref name=macdougall>Macdougall, Norman p. 123-124, 136, 140\u2013141.</ref> Spanish ambassadors arrived in Edinburgh, and later [[Pedro de Ayala]] was established as a resident ambassador during the crisis. Warbeck married [[Lady Catherine Gordon]], a daughter of [[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]]. The marriage was celebrated in Edinburgh with a tournament. James gave Warbeck clothes for the wedding and armour covered with purple silk.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland''; 257, 262\u2013264</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Katie Stevenson (historian)|Katie Stevenson]] suggests the clothing bought for the tournament shows Warbeck fought in a team with the king and four knights.<ref>Stevenson, Katie, p. 84</ref> A copy of a love letter in Latin obtained by Pedro de Ayala is thought to be Warbeck's proposal to Lady Catherine.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=93373 ''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol. 1 (1862), no.119 & fn.]</ref> However, James' biographer [[Norman Macdougall]] comments that it is clear that nobody, with the possible exception of Margaret of Burgundy, took seriously his claim to be the prince; his marriage to a junior Scots noblewoman was scarcely what might be expected for a potential king of England.<ref name=macdougall />\n\nIn September 1496, James IV prepared to invade England with Warbeck. A red, gold and silver banner was made for Warbeck as the Duke of York; James's armour was gilded and painted; and the royal artillery was prepared.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', 292\u2013296.</ref> [[John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell|John Ramsay of Balmain]] (who called himself Lord Bothwell) described the events for Henry VII. He saw Roderic de Lalanne, a Flemish knight, arrive with two little ships and 60 German soldiers and meet James IV and talk to Warbeck. In Edinburgh Castle Ramsay saw two great French guns called 'curtalds,' 10 [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]] or little serpentines, and 30 iron breech loading 'cart guns' with 16 close-carts or wagons for the munitions. He estimated the invasion force would last only four to five days in England before it ran out of provisions. He suggested, from the safety of [[Berwick upon Tweed]], that the Scots could be vanquished by a modest English force attacking from north and south in a [[pincer movement]].<ref>Pinkerton, John, p. 438-441</ref>\n\nThe Scottish host assembled near Edinburgh and James IV and Warbeck offered prayers at [[Holyrood Abbey]] on 14 September, and on the next day at St Triduana's Chapel and Our Lady Kirk of [[Restalrig]].<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland''; 299\u2013300, 296.</ref> On 19 September the Scottish army was at Ellem and on 21 September 1496 they crossed the [[River Tweed]] at [[Coldstream]]. Miners set to work to demolish the tower of Hetoune (Castle Heaton) on 24 September, but the army quickly retreated when resources were expended,<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', 299\u2013300</ref> and hoped-for support for Perkin Warbeck in [[Northumberland]] failed to materialise. According to an English record, the Scots penetrated four miles into England with royal banner displayed, and destroyed three or four little towers (or [[Bastle house]]s). They left on 25 September 1496 when an English army commanded by [[Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland|Lord Neville]] approached from Newcastle.<ref>Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357\u20131509, vol. 4, HM Register House, Edinburgh (1888), no. 35, pp. 418\u20139, (there dated as if '1497'): David Dunlop (1991), 108\u20139 & fn., quotes another version, and cites four more, noting mistaken date in Bain (1888).</ref> When news of this invasion reached [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]], on 21 October 1496, he wrote to his ambassador in Spain, to request the Spanish monarchs make peace between England and Scotland. The peace mission was entrusted to [[Pedro de Ayala]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Milan\", (1912), no. 514.</ref>\n\nLater, wishing to be rid of Warbeck, James IV provided a ship called the ''Cuckoo'' and a hired crew under a Breton captain which returned Perkin to Waterford in shame in July 1497. James IV made peace with England by signing the [[Treaty of Ayton]] at [[Ayton Parish Church|St Dionysius's Church]] in [[Ayton, Scottish Borders|Ayton]] in [[Berwickshire]]. Once again Perkin attempted to lay siege to Waterford, but this time his effort lasted only eleven days before he was forced to flee Ireland, chased by four English ships. According to some sources, by this time he was left with only 120 men on two ships.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Second landing in England==\n{{Main|Second Cornish Uprising of 1497}}\n[[File:P102-Beaulieu Abby, where Perkin Warbeck took Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|[[Beaulieu Abbey]] in Hampshire, where Warbeck took sanctuary]]\n\nOn 7 September 1497, Warbeck landed at [[Whitesand Bay (Cornwall)|Whitesand Bay]], two miles north of [[Land's End]], in [[Cornwall]] hoping to capitalise on the [[Cornish people]]'s resentment in the aftermath of [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|their uprising]] only three months earlier.

Henry VII reached [[Taunton]] on 4 October 1497, where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined.

As soon as he confessed to being an impostor, he was released from the Tower of London, and was given accommodation at Henry's court. He was even allowed to be present at royal banquets. He was, however, kept under guard and was not allowed to sleep with his wife, who was living under the protection of the queen.\n\nAfter 18 months at court, Warbeck tried to escape. He was quickly recaptured. He was then held in the Tower, initially in solitary confinement, and later alongside [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]]; the two tried to escape in 1499. Captured once again, Warbeck was led from the Tower to [[Tyburn, London]] on 23 November 1499, where he read out a confession and was [[Hanging|hanged]].<ref name = \"ali\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goble|first1=Rachel|title=The Execution of Perkin Warbeck|journal=History Today|date=11 November 1999|issue=11|url=http://www.historytoday.com/rachel-goble/execution-perkin-warbeck|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> Warbeck's Irish ally John Atwater was also executed at Tyburn on the same day.

It is included in the ''Collected Poems of Lord Alfred Douglas'' published in 1928.\n* In [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s mystery novel ''[[Have His Carcase]]'', [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] discovers that the murderers lured the victim to his death by playing on his secret belief that he was the hereditary Tsar of Russia, based on his great-great-grandmother's purported [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]; when [[Harriet Vane]] points out that even if this were true, the man would not be the next in line to the throne, Peter remarks that [[genealogy]] has a way of making people believe what they want to believe, saying he knows a \"draper's assistant\" in [[Leeds]] who earnestly believes he will be crowned King of England as soon as he can find the record of his ancestor's marriage to Perkin Warbeck; the fact that Warbeck's claim to the throne was ultimately invalidated, and that the Tudor dynasty he laid claim to has since been replaced by others, doesn't faze him in the least.\n* The historical novel ''The Tudor Rose'' by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]] deals at length with the Warbeck plot, and implies that Warback actually was [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]].\n* Warbeck is the central character in [[Philip Lindsay]]'s historical novel ''They Have Their Dreams''.\n* Warbeck features in Robert Hume's ''Ruling Ambition''\n* Warbeck is a leading character in Judith Arnopp's historical novel ''A Song of Sixpence'' that follows the career of Elizabeth of York, Queen of Henry VII.\n* In 2005 [[Channel 4]] and RDF Media produced a drama entitled ''Princes in the Tower'' about the interrogation of Warbeck, starring [[Mark Umbers]]. Warbeck almost convinces Henry VII that he really is Richard, Duke of York. Warbeck \"remembers\" that Henry's mother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] poisoned his brother Edward V, after which Richard III spirited him away to safety. Warbeck succeeds in alienating King Henry from his mother and wife, who now believes Warbeck to be her lost brother. Margaret then shows Warbeck two young men in chains, who she presents as the real princes, locked up for years in isolation and now completely insane. She says Henry knows nothing about them. She forces Warbeck to confess he is an imposter to save the life of his son by [[Lady Catherine Gordon]]. Warbeck confesses and is hanged. In the final scene Margaret is seen overseeing the burial of a piece of regal clothing with two skeletons, while, in voice-over, [[Thomas More]], whose secret account of the events is supposed to be the drama's source, describes how lucky he has been under Henry VIII.\n* In the 1972 [[BBC]] television series ''[[The Shadow of the Tower]]'', Warbeck was portrayed by British actor [[Richard Warwick]].\n* The [[American Shakespeare Center]] (ASC) in [[Staunton, Virginia]], produced a comedy entitled ''The Brats of Clarence'', written specifically for the ASC 'Blackfriars' stage by Paul Menzer. The play tracks the progress of Perkin Warbeck from the Scottish court towards London to claim his birthright as heir to the throne.\n* Warbeck and his wife are characters in the novel ''The Crimson Crown'' by Edith Layton (1990). The main character is Lucas Lovat, a spy in the Court of Henry VII, and a subplot of the novel is his indecision as to whether Warbeck is, or is not, Prince Richard.\n* English comedians [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]] both make references to Warbeck, and fellow pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] in much of their work, both as [[Lee and Herring]] and individually. Simnel and Warbeck's names have appeared sporadically throughout their material over the years.\n* Warbeck's story is retold through the eyes of Grace Plantagenet in ''The King's Grace'', by Anne Easter Smith (2009).  Grace, an illegitimate daughter of Edward IV, attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the man who claims to be her half-brother Richard. Rosemary Hawley Jarman, in her novel \"We Speak No Treason\", also fictionalised unconfirmed speculation that Warbeck could have been another of Edward's illegitimate sons.<ref>Rosemary Hawley Jarman, We Speak No Treason, Book 1, Part Two</ref><ref>Smith, Anne Easter, The King's Grace</ref>\n* In [[Philippa Gregory]]'s 2009 novel ''[[The White Queen (novel)|The White Queen]]'', [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|the young Duke of York]] is sent into hiding by his mother, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], while a changeling is sent to the Tower. In the fifth novel of Gregory's ''The Cousins' War'' series, ''[[The White Princess]]'', a mysterious pretender appears, claiming to be Richard. King Henry Tudor invents an elaborate false history to justify denial of the pretender's claims, giving him the name Perkin Warbeck (among others). Although the novel never answers the question, Gregory states in the epilogue that she believes Warbeck's claim was genuine.\n* A miniseries ''[[The White Princess (miniseries)|The White Princess]]'' adapted from Gregory's novel was first aired on [[Starz]] in 2017 where Perkin Warbeck was played by Irish actor [[Patrick Gibson (actor)|Patrick Gibson]]. Unlike Gregory's original work, the series portrays Warbeck as the genuine Duke of York, who has escaped England and been raised by a Flemish boat maker.\n* A [[public house]] in [[Taunton]] and a cafe and shop in [[Falkland, Fife]] are named after Warbeck.\n* In the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Warbeck's name can be seen in the opening memory on a list of British Templars.\n* A latter section of Terence Morgan's novel ''The Master of Bruges'', expands on the theory that Prince Richard escaped to [[Flanders]], grew up in [[Tournai]] and returned to England as Perkin Warbeck.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n\n* {{Cite book|author=Ashley, Mike|title=British Kings & Queens|publisher=Carroll & Graf|year=2002|isbn=0-7867-1104-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofbr0000ashl_f1a2}} pp.&nbsp;231\u2013232.\n* [https://archive.org/details/cu31924091754410 Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357\u20131509, vol. 4, HM Register House, Edinburgh (1888)]\n* Busch, Wilhelm, \"England Under the Tudors,\" 1892. pp.&nbsp;440\u2013441.\n* {{cite book|title=Compota Thesaurariorum Regum Scotorum.

She has been most notably portrayed by [[Eileen Davidson]], who originated the role in June 1982 before departing in 1988. [[Brenda Epperson]] portrayed Ashley from 1988 to 1995, before [[Shari Shattuck]] portrayed the role for the next three years, until Davidson's return in 1999. Davidson was nominated in 2003 for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\nThe character is the daughter of [[Dina Mergeron]] and Brent Davis, although she believed [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] was her biological father until she reached adulthood. She has had relationships with various men throughout the years, most notably [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Steven Lassiter|Steven Lassiter]], [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]], [[Blade Bladeson]], [[Cole Howard]] and [[Brad Carlton]]. She has a daughter with Victor, [[Abby Newman]]. She is also known for her business contributions to her father's company, [[Jabot Cosmetics]], much like her brother [[Jack Abbott (Y&R)|Jack]]. In 2006, it was announced that Davidson was to leave ''The Young and the Restless''. She last appeared on January 11, 2007. Shortly after, the character crossed over to its sister soap, ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. There, she became intertwined with the [[Forrester family|Forresters]] and [[Forrester Creations]]; she also had a romance with [[Ridge Forrester]]. She left ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in 2008 and returned to ''The Young and the Restless'', where she has since had relationships with Victor once again and [[Tucker McCall]].\n\nIn May 2012, it was announced that Davidson was let go from ''The Young and the Restless'', leading to her exit on August 3, 2012. Davidson initially hadn't known why, but it was reported later that [[Sony Pictures Television]] terminated her contract with the show for her to return to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' as [[Kristen DiMera]], a character she had portrayed there over 14 years prior. Davidson made a brief return to ''The Young and the Restless'' in March 2013 for the soap's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Eileen-Davidson-The-Young-And-The-Restless-Return-1061207.aspx |title=Exclusive: Eileen Davidson on Her Return to The Young and the Restless |last=Logan |first=Michael |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> After subsequent guest appearances, Davidson returned to ''The Young and the Restless'' on September 3, 2014, as a series regular.

Twenty-two years later, after completing college, Ashley returns to Genoa City and applies for a job as a lab chemist at [[Jabot Cosmetics]],  the family company, using the name Susan Ashley so she will be hired for her skills, not her family connections. She takes over as president of the company after her brother [[Jack Abbott (Y&R)|Jack Abbott]] ([[Terry Lester]], later [[Peter Bergman]]) is shot on his one-year anniversary by his wife, [[Patty Williams]]. Ashley commences an unlucky streak of relationships; starting with French artist Eric Garrison, who slept with her mother, and Marc Mergeron, who is revealed to be her former stepbrother. Capitalizing on her unluckiness, it is revealed that Ashley's biological father is Brent Davis, not John Abbott, who remains unaware of Ashley's true paternity. Trauma leads Ashley to become missing with amnesia, where she is found by business tycoon [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] ([[Eric Braeden]]), who takes her back to Genoa City. Ashley has an affair with Victor, who is married to [[Nikki Newman]] ([[Melody Thomas Scott]]). To spite Ashley, Nikki engages in an affair with Jack and tries to have Victor's brother, Matt Miller, unsuccessfully seduce Ashley. Ultimately, Victor chooses to be with Ashley, angering Nikki. When Ashley falls pregnant with Victor's child, Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, causing Victor to leave Ashley, who secretly has an abortion. Ashley suffers a mental breakdown, before marrying her psychiatrist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Steven Lassiter|Steven Lassiter]] (Rod Arrants). Steven's former patient [[Leanna Love|Leanna Randolph]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]) stalks the couple and attempts to destroy Ashley. She writes a biography about Victor that exposes information about his dysfunctional relationship with Ashley. Steven is later shot and killed by an unstable patient.\n\nFollowing a short affair with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]), Ashley marries Victor. The marriage suffers because of  Nikki's ongoing problems as well as Victor's daughter [[Victoria Newman]]'s ([[Heather Tom]]) constant schemes to break them up. After her divorce from Victor, Ashley falls in love with Jabot's mysterious photographer [[Blade Bladeson]] ([[Michael Tylo]]), and they get married. Blade's vengeful twin brother [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Rick Bladeson|Rick Bladeson]] arrives in town, holds Blade hostage and impersonates him. Eventually, Ashley and Blade's marriage ends. She then falls romantically for [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Kurt Costner|Kurt Costner]] ([[Leigh McCloskey]]), who is shot saving her from muggers. The romance is short-lived, as Kurt leaves Ashley to be with Victor's ex-wife [[Hope Wilson]] ([[Signy Coleman]]). Ashley nearly engages in an affair with Victoria's husband [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]), an author who is writing a novel about her life, which requires them to spend time together. After Victoria's pregnancy results in a stillborn baby, Cole divorces her and marries Ashley. The marriage suffers a rough patch when Ashley travels to Madrid to help her stepbrother [[Rafael Delgado (The Young and the Restless)|Rafael Delgado]] ([[Carlos Bernard]]), who is dealing with dangerous customers after selling them forged paintings. Cole assumes that she is having an affair with Rafael, unaware of who he is. During this, Victoria attempts to sabotage the marriage. Ultimately, upon Ashley's return to Genoa City, the couple divorce.\n\nBy 2000, one of Jack's former lovers and Victor's latest ex-wife, [[Diane Jenkins]] ([[Alex Donnelley]]) steals Victor's sperm from a sperm bank, though Nikki switches the sample with Jack's sperm. Ashley then steals Victor's sperm and impregnates herself, claiming that the father is a stranger; this was to make up for the abortion she had years prior. She then marries Brad Carlton and gives birth to [[Abby Carlton]], who is raised to believe she is the daughter of Brad. Ashley is diagnosed with breast cancer, and feeling that she may not have time left, she confesses the truth about Abby's paternity to Victor. Brad and Ashley split, though are brought together when she becomes pregnant with their child. Stress over the battle between Jabot and Newman Enterprises causes her to leave town. While she is driving back, she is involved in a car accident, killing the unborn child. Victor is blamed for the child's death. Brad and Ashley's marriage continues to diminish and they are divorced. [[Tom Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), the dangerous ex-husband of John's wife [[Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]), arrives in town. To protect his family, John shoots and kills Tom. Ashley covers this up by confessing to the crime herself, though John soon confesses himself, and is jailed for seven years. Gloria contaminates Ashley's new line of beauty cream, which causes a woman to die. John suffers a heart attack following his release from prison, and passes away. Jack removes Gloria from the family, and Ashley leaves town to escape the drama. During a business trip to France, Ashley meets [[Rick Forrester]] ([[Kyle Lowder]]), and they have an affair. She later travels to Los Angeles to work with [[Forrester Creations]] as a lab chemist. Rick and Ashley decide to keep their affair a secret, and she commences a serious relationship with [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]), whom she becomes engaged to. Ridge's attentiveness to his former love [[Brooke Logan]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) ends the engagement. Ashley then has a short-lived romance with Brooke's brother [[Storm Logan|Storm]] ([[William deVry]]). Forrester Creations decide to discontinue their fragrance line, diminishing Ashley's role in the company. She leaves Los Angeles and moves to Europe with Abby.\n\nAshley locates a missing Victor in France, where they reunite. Upon their return to Genoa City as a couple, they are married and Ashley becomes pregnant. Victor's manipulative son [[Adam Newman]] ([[Michael Muhney]]) gas lights Ashley, making her believe that she is seeing the ghost of Victor's late wife, [[Sabrina Newman]]. Adam causes Ashley to fall down a staircase and lose her baby, though he convinces her that this was a dream, and she suffers from an hysterical pregnancy. Ashley checks herself into a psychiatric hospital where [[Sharon Newman]] ([[Sharon Case]]), also pregnant, is staying. After Ashley begins experiencing hysterical labor, Adam kidnaps Sharon's newborn baby [[Faith Newman]] and gives her to Ashley, with Sharon believing her baby was stillborn. In the ensuing months, Sharon marries Adam and develops a close friendship with Ashley. Six months after Faith is born, the doctor that delivered her (who was being blackmailed by Adam) confesses the truth in a letter. Ashley is forced to hand Faith over to Sharon and the child's father, Victor's son [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]). Ashley moves on with her life, and becomes engaged to wealthy tycoon [[Tucker McCall]] ([[Stephen Nichols]]). Prior to their engagement, he slept with [[Diane Jenkins]] ([[Maura West]]). They briefly split up because of Tucker's secret business plans with Jack, but reunite shortly thereafter. Abby accidentally runs over Tucker with her car, and Ashley protects her by taking the blame. She is accused of attempted murder and driving under the influence. All charges are ultimately dropped, and she marries Tucker. Their marriage quickly lands in divorce because of Tucker's business scheming and his affair with a previous lover, [[Harmony Hamilton]]. Ashley is later forced out as CEO of Jabot by Jack, and Ashley decides to move to New York City with Traci. She returns briefly a few months later for the wedding of Victor and Nikki. Months later, Ashley returns for the funeral of her niece Delia Abbott and comforts her brother Billy on his loss. She returns later to spend Thanksgiving with her family. While there, she sprained her ankle and met [[Stitch Rayburn|Dr. Stitch Rayburn]] ([[Sean Carrigan]]). Abby pushed for a romance, but Ashley reminded her that Stitch was married and had a young son.\n\nIn town for Abby and Tyler's engagement party, Ashley left early to drop by the hospital and \"run into\" Dr. Rayburn. But she found Victoria waiting for him to take her on a date. Ashley reminded her that she'd only been separated a week. When Ben arrived, Victoria was jealously catty, informing Ben that Ashley was her former stepmother.\n\nIn September 2014, Ashley did not show up in Genoa City after calling a meeting among the major Jabot stockholders, Jack, Billy, Traci, and Abby. Jack phoned her, and she explained that she was working on a special project, but had decided it was not yet ready to present to them.\n\nThe following month, Ashley returned and confirmed that her idea was for a revolutionary new fragrance, and she made a deal with Jack to become Co-CEO of Jabot again if it panned out. Abby had been treating Ben Rayburn nasty and spiteful ever since she found out that he had killed his father as a teen and taken someone else's identity to get his degree in medicine, and broken Victoria's heart. So Abby was shocked when Ashley hired Ben as a chemist for Jabot, despite Abby's objections. Ashley returned to New York City to wrap things up, tasking a reluctant Abby with bringing Ben up to speed on the cosmetics industry. Before she left, she consoled Billy that maybe she could help keep Ben away from Victoria for him.\n\nOn Ashley's return, she asked Ben to smell the new fragrance, he found it repulsive, but he kissed her. Ashley revealed that the fragrance contained pheromones, was a love potion, and the kiss had proven it. What she needed was his help to make the scent bearable. Later after Ben was arrested for fraud by a former patient, Ashley bailed him out. She confided in Ben, that she too had taken a murder rap for someone she loved. Ashley asked him to accompany her to Madison on business.\n\nBen showed up in Ashley's office drunk after seeing Billy and Victoria snuggling with their baby. Ashley threw him in the shower to sober him up, and he pulled her in too. They had sex, and Stitch spent the night. The next day, they agreed to tell no one after Ben found out that he still had a chance with Victoria.\n\nVictor invited Ashley to lunch and tried to get her to take a deal to leave Jabot and work for him at Newman-Chancellor. But Ashley declined and left early, arriving back at the lab in time to see her lab assistant Tobias taking photos of their secret work. She guessed that he was working for Victor, and decided to let him continue in order to feed him bogus information. Ashley runs into Joe Clark at the athletic club. After referring to them having a good thing going back in New York City, they made plans to spend New Year's Eve together. In May 2017, Ashley's mother Dina came for a \"permanent\" visit. In October 2017, Dina exposed that John Abbott wasn't Ashley's father. Ashley leaves Genoa City in October 2018, following a series of events that leave her feeling alienated from both the Abbott family and Jabot, following the discovery that John and Dina left legal documents leaving all of Ashley's product patents to her; she confesses she's leaving for Paris to launch her own company with said-patents.\n\n==Reception==\nJamey Giddens of [[Zap2it]] described Davidson as \"one of Genoa City's most beloved heroines\".<ref name=\"Heroine\">{{cite news|last=Giddens|first=Jamey|title=RUMOR REPORT: Is Eileen Davidson on Her Way OUT at The Young and the Restless?!|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/05/09/rumor-report-is-eileen-davidson-on-her-way-out-at-the-young-and-the-restless|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Zap2it]].

She has been most notably portrayed by [[Eileen Davidson]], who originated the role in June 1982 before departing in 1988. [[Brenda Epperson]] portrayed Ashley from 1988 to 1995, before [[Shari Shattuck]] portrayed the role for the next three years, until Davidson's return in 1999. Davidson was nominated in 2003 for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\nThe character is the daughter of [[Dina Mergeron]] and Brent Davis, although she believed [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] was her biological father until she reached adulthood. She has had relationships with various men throughout the years, most notably [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Steven Lassiter|Steven Lassiter]], [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]], [[Blade Bladeson]], [[Cole Howard]] and [[Brad Carlton]]. She has a daughter with Victor, [[Abby Newman]]. She is also known for her business contributions to her father's company, [[Jabot Cosmetics]], much like her brother [[Jack Abbott (Y&R)|Jack]]. In 2006, it was announced that Davidson was to leave ''The Young and the Restless''. She last appeared on January 11, 2007. Shortly after, the character crossed over to its sister soap, ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. There, she became intertwined with the [[Forrester family|Forresters]] and [[Forrester Creations]]; she also had a romance with [[Ridge Forrester]]. She left ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in 2008 and returned to ''The Young and the Restless'', where she has since had relationships with Victor once again and [[Tucker McCall]].\n\nIn May 2012, it was announced that Davidson was let go from ''The Young and the Restless'', leading to her exit on August 3, 2012. Davidson initially hadn't known why, but it was reported later that [[Sony Pictures Television]] terminated her contract with the show for her to return to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' as [[Kristen DiMera]], a character she had portrayed there over 14 years prior. Davidson made a brief return to ''The Young and the Restless'' in March 2013 for the soap's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Eileen-Davidson-The-Young-And-The-Restless-Return-1061207.aspx |title=Exclusive: Eileen Davidson on Her Return to The Young and the Restless |last=Logan |first=Michael |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> After subsequent guest appearances, Davidson returned to ''The Young and the Restless'' on September 3, 2014, as a series regular.

She stated: \"I think the character really suffered after she stole Victor\u2019s sperm from Diane [...] After that, the viewers lost a lot of respect for Ashley. People wanted Ashley to pay for it.

It was Ashley\u2019s redemption\".<ref name=\"Days\" /> Around this story arc, Tommy Garrett of ''[[Canyon News]]'' described Ashley as a \"damsel in distress\", stating that she had a \"twisted mind\" due to suffering a [[hysterical pregnancy]] after losing her unborn child at the hands of Adam.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Tommy|title=Leading Ladies Gold Standard, Women On the Edge|url=http://www.canyon-news.com/artman2/publish/Television/Leading_Ladies_Gold_Standard_Women_On_The_Edge.php|work=[[Canyon News]]|publisher=Glen Kelly|accessdate=August 11, 2013|date=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222152105/http://www.canyon-news.com/artman2/publish/Television/Leading_Ladies_Gold_Standard_Women_On_The_Edge.php|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of John, Jack works desperately to remove his wife [[Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) from the family, even illegally making changes to John's will. Explaining Ashley's ambivalence towards the situation, Davidson stated: \"Just because you don't like somebody doesn't mean you should do something illegal [...] The point is, their father loved her. And even if they don't like her, they have to honor what he wanted. Ashley never wanted to do anything that went against her father's wishes.\" The actress stated that Ashley \"just wants\" Jack to \"do the right thing\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinsey|first=Carolyn|title='Bold and the Beautiful': Crossover sister act|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/bold-beautiful-crossover-sister-act-article-1.276867|work=New York Daily News|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|accessdate=August 16, 2013|date=December 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\nAshley is born on April 29, 1960, to [[John Abbott, Sr.]] ([[Brett Halsey]], later [[Jerry Douglas (actor)|Jerry Douglas]]) and [[Dina Abbott Mergeron]] ([[Marla Adams]]). Twenty-two years later, after completing college, Ashley returns to Genoa City and applies for a job as a lab chemist at [[Jabot Cosmetics]],  the family company, using the name Susan Ashley so she will be hired for her skills, not her family connections. She takes over as president of the company after her brother [[Jack Abbott (Y&R)|Jack Abbott]] ([[Terry Lester]], later [[Peter Bergman]]) is shot on his one-year anniversary by his wife, [[Patty Williams]]. Ashley commences an unlucky streak of relationships; starting with French artist Eric Garrison, who slept with her mother, and Marc Mergeron, who is revealed to be her former stepbrother. Capitalizing on her unluckiness, it is revealed that Ashley's biological father is Brent Davis, not John Abbott, who remains unaware of Ashley's true paternity. Trauma leads Ashley to become missing with amnesia, where she is found by business tycoon [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] ([[Eric Braeden]]), who takes her back to Genoa City. Ashley has an affair with Victor, who is married to [[Nikki Newman]] ([[Melody Thomas Scott]]). To spite Ashley, Nikki engages in an affair with Jack and tries to have Victor's brother, Matt Miller, unsuccessfully seduce Ashley. Ultimately, Victor chooses to be with Ashley, angering Nikki. When Ashley falls pregnant with Victor's child, Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, causing Victor to leave Ashley, who secretly has an abortion. Ashley suffers a mental breakdown, before marrying her psychiatrist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Steven Lassiter|Steven Lassiter]] (Rod Arrants). Steven's former patient [[Leanna Love|Leanna Randolph]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]) stalks the couple and attempts to destroy Ashley. She writes a biography about Victor that exposes information about his dysfunctional relationship with Ashley. Steven is later shot and killed by an unstable patient.\n\nFollowing a short affair with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]), Ashley marries Victor. The marriage suffers because of  Nikki's ongoing problems as well as Victor's daughter [[Victoria Newman]]'s ([[Heather Tom]]) constant schemes to break them up. After her divorce from Victor, Ashley falls in love with Jabot's mysterious photographer [[Blade Bladeson]] ([[Michael Tylo]]), and they get married. Blade's vengeful twin brother [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Rick Bladeson|Rick Bladeson]] arrives in town, holds Blade hostage and impersonates him. Eventually, Ashley and Blade's marriage ends. She then falls romantically for [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Kurt Costner|Kurt Costner]] ([[Leigh McCloskey]]), who is shot saving her from muggers. The romance is short-lived, as Kurt leaves Ashley to be with Victor's ex-wife [[Hope Wilson]] ([[Signy Coleman]]). Ashley nearly engages in an affair with Victoria's husband [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]), an author who is writing a novel about her life, which requires them to spend time together. After Victoria's pregnancy results in a stillborn baby, Cole divorces her and marries Ashley. The marriage suffers a rough patch when Ashley travels to Madrid to help her stepbrother [[Rafael Delgado (The Young and the Restless)|Rafael Delgado]] ([[Carlos Bernard]]), who is dealing with dangerous customers after selling them forged paintings. Cole assumes that she is having an affair with Rafael, unaware of who he is. During this, Victoria attempts to sabotage the marriage. Ultimately, upon Ashley's return to Genoa City, the couple divorce.\n\nBy 2000, one of Jack's former lovers and Victor's latest ex-wife, [[Diane Jenkins]] ([[Alex Donnelley]]) steals Victor's sperm from a sperm bank, though Nikki switches the sample with Jack's sperm. Ashley then steals Victor's sperm and impregnates herself, claiming that the father is a stranger; this was to make up for the abortion she had years prior. She then marries Brad Carlton and gives birth to [[Abby Carlton]], who is raised to believe she is the daughter of Brad. Ashley is diagnosed with breast cancer, and feeling that she may not have time left, she confesses the truth about Abby's paternity to Victor. Brad and Ashley split, though are brought together when she becomes pregnant with their child. Stress over the battle between Jabot and Newman Enterprises causes her to leave town. While she is driving back, she is involved in a car accident, killing the unborn child. Victor is blamed for the child's death. Brad and Ashley's marriage continues to diminish and they are divorced. [[Tom Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), the dangerous ex-husband of John's wife [[Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]), arrives in town. To protect his family, John shoots and kills Tom. Ashley covers this up by confessing to the crime herself, though John soon confesses himself, and is jailed for seven years. Gloria contaminates Ashley's new line of beauty cream, which causes a woman to die. John suffers a heart attack following his release from prison, and passes away. Jack removes Gloria from the family, and Ashley leaves town to escape the drama. During a business trip to France, Ashley meets [[Rick Forrester]] ([[Kyle Lowder]]), and they have an affair. She later travels to Los Angeles to work with [[Forrester Creations]] as a lab chemist. Rick and Ashley decide to keep their affair a secret, and she commences a serious relationship with [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]), whom she becomes engaged to. Ridge's attentiveness to his former love [[Brooke Logan]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) ends the engagement. Ashley then has a short-lived romance with Brooke's brother [[Storm Logan|Storm]] ([[William deVry]]). Forrester Creations decide to discontinue their fragrance line, diminishing Ashley's role in the company. She leaves Los Angeles and moves to Europe with Abby.\n\nAshley locates a missing Victor in France, where they reunite. Upon their return to Genoa City as a couple, they are married and Ashley becomes pregnant. Victor's manipulative son [[Adam Newman]] ([[Michael Muhney]]) gas lights Ashley, making her believe that she is seeing the ghost of Victor's late wife, [[Sabrina Newman]]. Adam causes Ashley to fall down a staircase and lose her baby, though he convinces her that this was a dream, and she suffers from an hysterical pregnancy. Ashley checks herself into a psychiatric hospital where [[Sharon Newman]] ([[Sharon Case]]), also pregnant, is staying. After Ashley begins experiencing hysterical labor, Adam kidnaps Sharon's newborn baby [[Faith Newman]] and gives her to Ashley, with Sharon believing her baby was stillborn. In the ensuing months, Sharon marries Adam and develops a close friendship with Ashley. Six months after Faith is born, the doctor that delivered her (who was being blackmailed by Adam) confesses the truth in a letter. Ashley is forced to hand Faith over to Sharon and the child's father, Victor's son [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]). Ashley moves on with her life, and becomes engaged to wealthy tycoon [[Tucker McCall]] ([[Stephen Nichols]]). Prior to their engagement, he slept with [[Diane Jenkins]] ([[Maura West]]). They briefly split up because of Tucker's secret business plans with Jack, but reunite shortly thereafter. Abby accidentally runs over Tucker with her car, and Ashley protects her by taking the blame. She is accused of attempted murder and driving under the influence. All charges are ultimately dropped, and she marries Tucker. Their marriage quickly lands in divorce because of Tucker's business scheming and his affair with a previous lover, [[Harmony Hamilton]]. Ashley is later forced out as CEO of Jabot by Jack, and Ashley decides to move to New York City with Traci. She returns briefly a few months later for the wedding of Victor and Nikki. Months later, Ashley returns for the funeral of her niece Delia Abbott and comforts her brother Billy on his loss. She returns later to spend Thanksgiving with her family. While there, she sprained her ankle and met [[Stitch Rayburn|Dr. Stitch Rayburn]] ([[Sean Carrigan]]). Abby pushed for a romance, but Ashley reminded her that Stitch was married and had a young son.\n\nIn town for Abby and Tyler's engagement party, Ashley left early to drop by the hospital and \"run into\" Dr. Rayburn. But she found Victoria waiting for him to take her on a date. Ashley reminded her that she'd only been separated a week. When Ben arrived, Victoria was jealously catty, informing Ben that Ashley was her former stepmother.\n\nIn September 2014, Ashley did not show up in Genoa City after calling a meeting among the major Jabot stockholders, Jack, Billy, Traci, and Abby. Jack phoned her, and she explained that she was working on a special project, but had decided it was not yet ready to present to them.\n\nThe following month, Ashley returned and confirmed that her idea was for a revolutionary new fragrance, and she made a deal with Jack to become Co-CEO of Jabot again if it panned out. Abby had been treating Ben Rayburn nasty and spiteful ever since she found out that he had killed his father as a teen and taken someone else's identity to get his degree in medicine, and broken Victoria's heart. So Abby was shocked when Ashley hired Ben as a chemist for Jabot, despite Abby's objections. Ashley returned to New York City to wrap things up, tasking a reluctant Abby with bringing Ben up to speed on the cosmetics industry. Before she left, she consoled Billy that maybe she could help keep Ben away from Victoria for him.\n\nOn Ashley's return, she asked Ben to smell the new fragrance, he found it repulsive, but he kissed her. Ashley revealed that the fragrance contained pheromones, was a love potion, and the kiss had proven it. What she needed was his help to make the scent bearable. Later after Ben was arrested for fraud by a former patient, Ashley bailed him out. She confided in Ben, that she too had taken a murder rap for someone she loved. Ashley asked him to accompany her to Madison on business.\n\nBen showed up in Ashley's office drunk after seeing Billy and Victoria snuggling with their baby. Ashley threw him in the shower to sober him up, and he pulled her in too. They had sex, and Stitch spent the night. The next day, they agreed to tell no one after Ben found out that he still had a chance with Victoria.\n\nVictor invited Ashley to lunch and tried to get her to take a deal to leave Jabot and work for him at Newman-Chancellor. But Ashley declined and left early, arriving back at the lab in time to see her lab assistant Tobias taking photos of their secret work. She guessed that he was working for Victor, and decided to let him continue in order to feed him bogus information. Ashley runs into Joe Clark at the athletic club. After referring to them having a good thing going back in New York City, they made plans to spend New Year's Eve together. In May 2017, Ashley's mother Dina came for a \"permanent\" visit. In October 2017, Dina exposed that John Abbott wasn't Ashley's father. Ashley leaves Genoa City in October 2018, following a series of events that leave her feeling alienated from both the Abbott family and Jabot, following the discovery that John and Dina left legal documents leaving all of Ashley's product patents to her; she confesses she's leaving for Paris to launch her own company with said-patents.\n\n==Reception==\nJamey Giddens of [[Zap2it]] described Davidson as \"one of Genoa City's most beloved heroines\".<ref name=\"Heroine\">{{cite news|last=Giddens|first=Jamey|title=RUMOR REPORT: Is Eileen Davidson on Her Way OUT at The Young and the Restless?!|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/05/09/rumor-report-is-eileen-davidson-on-her-way-out-at-the-young-and-the-restless|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Zap2it]].
