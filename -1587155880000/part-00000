Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912), and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries, and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret \u2013 St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life, including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]], and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]], in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.\n\nThere have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''{{lang|de|Der Wiederg\u00e4nger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain}}'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]], and ''L'\u00e9nigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ethuin]].\n\n===Occult biography===\nA book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard, purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to this theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family, yet knew of his true birth, and left numerous hints throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon of this, in the form of explicit clues in the text of the plays, in pictures, and in the alleged use of [[Bacon's cipher]] in the works.\n\n===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===\nSaint Germain is the central figure in a series of books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as \"Godfr\u00e9 Ray King\", describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, Ballard discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the \"I AM\" Religious Activity, founded in 1930 \u2013 the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.\n\nThere are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the \"Green Books\". Another significant work, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, AKA the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the \"I AM\" Religious Activity.\n\n===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===\nSeveral [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: \n* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.\n* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, \"the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance\".<ref>Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32</ref> Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears \"a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet.\"<ref>Leadbeater, C.W.

''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934</ref>\n* [[Edgar Cayce]], the \"Sleeping Prophet\", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: \"When needed.\" (From reading # 254\u201383 on 2/14/1935.)\n* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.\n* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.\n* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice on 23 May 2014.\n*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973, St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meetings with him as well as other Masters.\n*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on 10 June 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana, and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book ''Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age''.<ref>\"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY\" (Meru Press, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Esoteric activities===\nMany groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.\n\nThe Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Master of the Ancient Wisdom, or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref>[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' \"An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages\" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on \"St. Germain\"</ref>\n\nIn [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the \"Chohan of the Seventh Ray\".<ref>\"Saint Germain\" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80\u201390 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)</ref> According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy, the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called \"The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius\".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is \"The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]\".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the \"Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]\".\n\nIn the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rak\u00f3czi'' or the ''Master R.''<ref name=\"fire1237\">Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three \u2013 Division A \u2013 Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237</ref>  In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi, otherwise known as the Great Divine Director, is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters. Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667</ref> He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that \"sometime after AD 2025,\" the Jesus, the Master Rak\u00f3czi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would \"externalise\"<!--British spelling of externalize-->, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530</ref>\n\nAlice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the \"manager of the executive council of the Christ\".<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508</ref>(Theosophists regard \"the Master Jesus\" and \"Christ\" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which \"Christ\" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]].) According to certain Theosophists, \"Christ\" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the \"executive council of the Christ\" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.\n\n===Previous incarnations===\nAccording to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as the following. (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)\n\n* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called \"The City of the Sun\"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then-lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].\n* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].\n* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.\n* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).\n* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt.

Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.<ref>Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]</ref>\n* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n===Ascension into masterhood===\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and even attended his own \"funeral\" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rak\u00f3czi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth \u2013 the sixth level of Initiation), at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name \"Saint Germain\".<ref>\"Saint Germain\" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse.

Another significant work, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, AKA the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the \"I AM\" Religious Activity.\n\n===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===\nSeveral [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: \n* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.\n* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, \"the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance\".<ref>Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32</ref> Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears \"a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet.\"<ref>Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240</ref>\n* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [[\"I AM\" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his \"training\" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.<ref>King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934</ref>\n* [[Edgar Cayce]], the \"Sleeping Prophet\", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: \"When needed.\" (From reading # 254\u201383 on 2/14/1935.)\n* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.\n* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.\n* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice on 23 May 2014.\n*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973, St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meetings with him as well as other Masters.\n*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on 10 June 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana, and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book ''Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age''.<ref>\"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY\" (Meru Press, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Esoteric activities===\nMany groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.\n\nThe Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Master of the Ancient Wisdom, or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref>[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' \"An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages\" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on \"St. Germain\"</ref>\n\nIn [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the \"Chohan of the Seventh Ray\".<ref>\"Saint Germain\" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80\u201390 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)</ref> According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy, the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called \"The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius\".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is \"The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]\".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the \"Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]\".\n\nIn the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rak\u00f3czi'' or the ''Master R.''<ref name=\"fire1237\">Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three \u2013 Division A \u2013 Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237</ref>  In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi, otherwise known as the Great Divine Director, is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters. Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667</ref> He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that \"sometime after AD 2025,\" the Jesus, the Master Rak\u00f3czi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would \"externalise\"<!--British spelling of externalize-->, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530</ref>\n\nAlice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the \"manager of the executive council of the Christ\".<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957\u2014Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508</ref>(Theosophists regard \"the Master Jesus\" and \"Christ\" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which \"Christ\" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]].) According to certain Theosophists, \"Christ\" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the \"executive council of the Christ\" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.\n\n===Previous incarnations===\nAccording to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as the following. (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)\n\n* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called \"The City of the Sun\"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then-lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].\n* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].\n* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.\n* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).\n* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427\u2013347 BC).\n* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.\n* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr \u2013 he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.\n* [[Proclus]], c. 410 \u2013 485 AD.

He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.\n* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.\n* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220\u20131292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.<ref>Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]</ref>\n* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n===Ascension into masterhood===\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and even attended his own \"funeral\" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rak\u00f3czi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth \u2013 the sixth level of Initiation), at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name \"Saint Germain\".<ref>\"Saint Germain\" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse.
