Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the [[United States Congress]]. [[Andrew W. Mellon]] donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by [[Paul Mellon]], [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]], [[Samuel Henry Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush Harrison Kress]], [[Peter Arrell Browne Widener]], [[Joseph E. Widener]], and [[Chester Dale]]. The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Americas and the largest mobile created by [[Alexander Calder]].\n\nThe Gallery's campus includes the original neoclassical West Building designed by [[John Russell Pope]], which is linked underground to the modern East Building, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], and the {{convert|6.1|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden|Sculpture Garden]]. The Gallery often presents temporary special exhibitions spanning the world and the history of art. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest museums]] in North America.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Gallery15Urlan.ogv|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art]]\n[[Pittsburgh]] banker (and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] from 1921 until 1932) [[Andrew W. Mellon]] began gathering a private collection of [[old master]] paintings and sculptures during World War I. During the late 1920s, Mellon decided to direct his collecting efforts towards the establishment of a new national gallery for the United States.\n\nIn 1930, partly for tax reasons, Mellon formed the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, which was to be the legal owner of works intended for the gallery. In 1930\u20131931, the Trust made its first major acquisition, [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|21 paintings]] from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St. Petersburg as part of the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], including such masterpieces as [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Alba Madonna]],'' [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'', and [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''.\n\nIn 1929 Mellon had initiated contact with the recently appointed Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Greeley Abbot]]. Mellon was appointed in 1931 as a Commissioner of the Institution's National Gallery of Art. When the director of the Gallery retired, Mellon asked Abbot not to appoint a successor, as he proposed to endow a new building with funds for expansion of the collections.\n\nHowever, Mellon's trial for tax evasion, centering on the Trust and the Hermitage paintings, caused the plan to be modified. In 1935, Mellon announced in ''[[The Washington Star]]'', his intention to establish a new gallery for old masters, separate from the Smithsonian. When asked by Abbot, he explained that the project was in the hands of the Trust and that its decisions were partly dependent on \"the attitude of the Government towards the gift\".\n\nIn January 1937, Mellon formally offered to create the new Gallery.  On his birthday, 24 March 1937, an Act of Congress accepted the collection and building funds (provided through the Trust), and approved the construction of a museum on the National Mall.\n\nThe new gallery was to be effectively self-governing, not controlled by the Smithsonian, but took the old name \"National Gallery of Art\" while the Smithsonian's gallery would be renamed the \"National Collection of Fine Arts\" (now the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]).<ref>Fink, Lois Marie \"A History of the Smithsonian American Art Museum\", [[University of Massachusetts Press]] (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-55849-616-3}}, chapter 3</ref><ref>[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm National Gallery of Art website: general introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208014849/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm |date=December 8, 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm National Gallery of Art website: chronology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407175119/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm |date=April 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDesigned by architect [[John Russell Pope]], the new structure was completed and accepted by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on behalf of the American people on March 17, 1941. Neither Mellon nor Pope lived to see the museum completed; both died in late August 1937, only two months after excavation had begun. At the time of its inception it was the largest marble structure in the world. The museum stands on the former site of the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] station, where in 1881 a disgruntled office seeker, [[Charles Guiteau]], shot President [[James Garfield]] (see [[James A. Garfield assassination]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.american-architecture.info/USA/USA-Washington/DC-010.htm| title=National Gallery of Art, West Building| publisher=American Architecture| accessdate=2 October 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006024153/http://www.american-architecture.info/USA/USA-Washington/DC-010.htm| archivedate=6 October 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs anticipated by Mellon, the creation of the National Gallery encouraged the donation of other substantial art collections by a number of private donors. Founding benefactors included such individuals as [[Paul Mellon]], [[Samuel H. Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush H. Kress]], [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], [[Chester Dale]], [[Joseph Widener]], [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]] and [[Edgar Garbisch|Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch]].\n\nThe Gallery's East Building was constructed in the 1970s on much of the remaining land left over from the original congressional action. Andrew Mellon's children, [[Paul Mellon]] and [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], funded the building. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the contemporary structure was completed in 1978 and was opened on June 1 of that year by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The new building was built to house the Museum's collection of modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, as well as study and research centers and offices. The design received a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1981.\n\nThe final addition to the complex is the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]]. Completed and opened to the public on May 23, 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting a number of pieces from the Museum's contemporary sculpture collection.\n\nIn 2011, an extensive refurbishment and renovation of the French galleries were undertaken. As part of the celebration of the reopening of this wing, organist [[Alexander Frey]] performed 4 sold-out recitals of music of France in one weekend in the French Gallery.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:National Gallery of Art Logo.gif|right|framed|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art logo.]]\nThe National Gallery of Art is supported through a private-public partnership. The United States federal government provides funds, through annual appropriations, to support the museum's operations and maintenance. All artwork, as well as special programs, are provided through private donations and funds. The museum is not part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nNoted directors of the National Gallery have included [[David E. Finley, Jr.]] (1938-1956), [[John Walker (curator)|John Walker]] (1956\u20131968), and [[J. Carter Brown]] (1968\u20131993). [[Earl A.

The West Building, composed of [[Tennessee marble|pink Tennessee marble]], was designed in 1937 by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style (as is Pope's other notable Washington, D.C. building, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]). Designed in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. Extending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine. Bright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.\n[[File:Dome of East building.jpg|thumb|271x271px|Dome of West Building, an entrance to permanent Renaissance Art collections]]\nThe West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the [[Medieval art|medieval period]] through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists. Highlights of the collection include many paintings by [[Jan Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].\n\nIn contrast, the design of the East Building by architect [[I. M. Pei]] is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the isosceles triangle came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.\n\nThe building's central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning {{convert|16000|sqft|m2}}. The atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east NGA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003215403/http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east |date=October 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below.  In 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels.  The renovation was completed in 2016.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=December 8, 2009 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311002118/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | archivedate=March 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe East Building focuses on [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], with a collection including works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Alexander Calder]], a 1977 mural by [[Robert Motherwell]] and works by many other artists. The East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA). Among the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of [[Barnett Newman]]'s ''The Stations of the Cross'' series of 14 black and white paintings (1958\u201366).<ref>{{cite web|title=In The Tower: Barnett Newman|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201023351/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|archivedate=1 February 2015}}</ref> Newman painted them after he had recovered from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://forward.com/articles/159912/his-cross-to-bear/?p=all| title= His Cross To Bear.

In 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist [[Leo Villareal]] to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation. Today, ''Multiverse'' is the largest and most complex light sculpture by Villareal featuring approximately 41,000 computer-programmed LED nodes that run through channels along the entire {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}}-long space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.142055.html|title=Leo Villareal: Multiverse|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nga.gov}}</ref> The concourse also includes the food court and a gift shop.\n\nThe final element of the National Gallery of Art complex, the Sculpture Garden was completed in 1999 after more than 30 years of planning. To the west of the West Building, on the opposite side of [[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|Seventh Street]], the {{convert|6.1|acres|1|abbr=on}} Sculpture Garden was designed by landscape architect [[Laurie Olin]]<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Gallery|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/about.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922015956/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/about.html|archivedate=22 September 2014}}</ref> as an outdoor gallery for monumental modern sculpture.\n\nThe Sculpture Garden contains plantings of Native American species of canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials.

Paintings in the permanent collection date from the [[Middle Ages]] to the present. The [[Italian Renaissance]] collection includes two panels from [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maest\u00e0 (Duccio)|Maesta]]'', the [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' by [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Filippo Lippi]], a [[Botticelli]] work on the same subject, [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Allendale Nativity]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[The Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|The Feast of the Gods]]'', ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' (the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Americas) and groups of works by [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nThe collections include paintings by many European masters, including a version of ''[[Saint Martin and the Beggar (El Greco)|Saint Martin and the Beggar]],'' by [[El Greco]], and works by [[Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald]], [[Cranach the Elder]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], among others. The collection of sculpture and decorative arts includes such works as the ''Chalice'' of [[Abbot Suger]] of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]] and a collection of work by [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas]]. Other highlights of the permanent collection include the second of the two original sets of [[Thomas Cole]]'s series of paintings titled ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'', (the first set is at the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]]) and the original version of ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley]] (two other versions are in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]).\n\nThe National Gallery's print collection comprises 75,000 prints, in addition to rare illustrated books. It includes collections of works by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], [[William Blake]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. The collection began with 400 prints donated by five collectors in 1941. In 1942, [[Joseph E. Widener]] donated his entire collection of nearly 2,000 works. In 1943, [[Lessing Rosenwald]] donated his collection of 8,000 old master and modern prints; between 1943 and 1979, he donated almost 14,000 more works. In 2008, Dave and [[Reba White Williams]] donated their collection of more than 5,200 American prints.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/prints.html|title=Prints|date=2013-06-19|publisher=Nga.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221210959/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/prints.html|archivedate=2013-12-21|url-status=live|accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the NGA purchased from a private French collection [[Gerard van Honthorst]]'s 1623 painting, ''The Concert'', which had not been publicly viewed since 1795.

Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the [[United States Congress]]. [[Andrew W. Mellon]] donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by [[Paul Mellon]], [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]], [[Samuel Henry Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush Harrison Kress]], [[Peter Arrell Browne Widener]], [[Joseph E. Widener]], and [[Chester Dale]]. The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Americas and the largest mobile created by [[Alexander Calder]].\n\nThe Gallery's campus includes the original neoclassical West Building designed by [[John Russell Pope]], which is linked underground to the modern East Building, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], and the {{convert|6.1|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden|Sculpture Garden]]. The Gallery often presents temporary special exhibitions spanning the world and the history of art. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest museums]] in North America.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Gallery15Urlan.ogv|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art]]\n[[Pittsburgh]] banker (and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] from 1921 until 1932) [[Andrew W. Mellon]] began gathering a private collection of [[old master]] paintings and sculptures during World War I. During the late 1920s, Mellon decided to direct his collecting efforts towards the establishment of a new national gallery for the United States.\n\nIn 1930, partly for tax reasons, Mellon formed the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, which was to be the legal owner of works intended for the gallery. In 1930\u20131931, the Trust made its first major acquisition, [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|21 paintings]] from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St. Petersburg as part of the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], including such masterpieces as [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Alba Madonna]],'' [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'', and [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''.\n\nIn 1929 Mellon had initiated contact with the recently appointed Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Greeley Abbot]]. Mellon was appointed in 1931 as a Commissioner of the Institution's National Gallery of Art. When the director of the Gallery retired, Mellon asked Abbot not to appoint a successor, as he proposed to endow a new building with funds for expansion of the collections.\n\nHowever, Mellon's trial for tax evasion, centering on the Trust and the Hermitage paintings, caused the plan to be modified. In 1935, Mellon announced in ''[[The Washington Star]]'', his intention to establish a new gallery for old masters, separate from the Smithsonian. When asked by Abbot, he explained that the project was in the hands of the Trust and that its decisions were partly dependent on \"the attitude of the Government towards the gift\".\n\nIn January 1937, Mellon formally offered to create the new Gallery.  On his birthday, 24 March 1937, an Act of Congress accepted the collection and building funds (provided through the Trust), and approved the construction of a museum on the National Mall.\n\nThe new gallery was to be effectively self-governing, not controlled by the Smithsonian, but took the old name \"National Gallery of Art\" while the Smithsonian's gallery would be renamed the \"National Collection of Fine Arts\" (now the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]).<ref>Fink, Lois Marie \"A History of the Smithsonian American Art Museum\", [[University of Massachusetts Press]] (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-55849-616-3}}, chapter 3</ref><ref>[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm National Gallery of Art website: general introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208014849/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm |date=December 8, 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm National Gallery of Art website: chronology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407175119/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm |date=April 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDesigned by architect [[John Russell Pope]], the new structure was completed and accepted by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on behalf of the American people on March 17, 1941. Neither Mellon nor Pope lived to see the museum completed; both died in late August 1937, only two months after excavation had begun. At the time of its inception it was the largest marble structure in the world. The museum stands on the former site of the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] station, where in 1881 a disgruntled office seeker, [[Charles Guiteau]], shot President [[James Garfield]] (see [[James A.

Founding benefactors included such individuals as [[Paul Mellon]], [[Samuel H. Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush H.

Rosenwald]] and [[Edgar Garbisch|Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch]].\n\nThe Gallery's East Building was constructed in the 1970s on much of the remaining land left over from the original congressional action. Andrew Mellon's children, [[Paul Mellon]] and [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], funded the building. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the contemporary structure was completed in 1978 and was opened on June 1 of that year by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The new building was built to house the Museum's collection of modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, as well as study and research centers and offices. The design received a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1981.\n\nThe final addition to the complex is the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]]. Completed and opened to the public on May 23, 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting a number of pieces from the Museum's contemporary sculpture collection.\n\nIn 2011, an extensive refurbishment and renovation of the French galleries were undertaken. As part of the celebration of the reopening of this wing, organist [[Alexander Frey]] performed 4 sold-out recitals of music of France in one weekend in the French Gallery.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:National Gallery of Art Logo.gif|right|framed|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art logo.]]\nThe National Gallery of Art is supported through a private-public partnership. The United States federal government provides funds, through annual appropriations, to support the museum's operations and maintenance. All artwork, as well as special programs, are provided through private donations and funds. The museum is not part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nNoted directors of the National Gallery have included [[David E. Finley, Jr.]] (1938-1956), [[John Walker (curator)|John Walker]] (1956\u20131968), and [[J. Carter Brown]] (1968\u20131993). [[Earl A.

The West Building, composed of [[Tennessee marble|pink Tennessee marble]], was designed in 1937 by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style (as is Pope's other notable Washington, D.C. building, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]). Designed in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. Extending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine. Bright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.\n[[File:Dome of East building.jpg|thumb|271x271px|Dome of West Building, an entrance to permanent Renaissance Art collections]]\nThe West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the [[Medieval art|medieval period]] through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists. Highlights of the collection include many paintings by [[Jan Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].\n\nIn contrast, the design of the East Building by architect [[I. M. Pei]] is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the isosceles triangle came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.\n\nThe building's central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning {{convert|16000|sqft|m2}}. The atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east NGA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003215403/http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east |date=October 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below.  In 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels.  The renovation was completed in 2016.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=December 8, 2009 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311002118/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | archivedate=March 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe East Building focuses on [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], with a collection including works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Alexander Calder]], a 1977 mural by [[Robert Motherwell]] and works by many other artists. The East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA). Among the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of [[Barnett Newman]]'s ''The Stations of the Cross'' series of 14 black and white paintings (1958\u201366).<ref>{{cite web|title=In The Tower: Barnett Newman|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201023351/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|archivedate=1 February 2015}}</ref> Newman painted them after he had recovered from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://forward.com/articles/159912/his-cross-to-bear/?p=all| title= His Cross To Bear.

In 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist [[Leo Villareal]] to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation.

[[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was used on the gravity anchors to level the stones. Joints of flexible colored [[neoprene]] were placed between the panels. This system was designed to allow each panel to hang independent of its neighbors, and NGA officials say they are not aware of any other panel system like it.\n\nHowever, many panels were accidentally mortared together.

These suits were very similar to modern tarot divination decks and are still used in traditional [[Italian playing cards|Italian]], [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] playing card decks.<ref>[[Donald Laycock]] in ''Skeptical\u2014a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 67</ref>\n\nThe first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]], [[Florence]] and [[Bologna]] when additional trump cards with allegorical [[illustration]]s were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called ''carte da trionfi'', triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], which became \"trumps\" in English. The earliest documentation of ''trionfi'' is found in a written statement in the court records of [[Florence]], in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=In Search of Tarot Sources|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=100}}</ref><ref>Pratesi, Franco.

He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \"trumps\" since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a ''novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus'', or \"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=Italian Cards - New Discoveries|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=18|issue=1, 2|pages=28-32, 33-38}}</ref> Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [[Sola Busca tarot|Sola-Busca]] and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.<ref name=\"DummettGame\"/>\n\nIn [[Florence]], an expanded deck called ''[[Minchiate]]'' was used.

It was only after the invention of the [[printing press]] that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [[Italian Wars]]. The most important tarot pattern used in these two countries was the [[Tarot of Marseilles]] of Milanese origin.<ref name=\"DummettGame\" />\n\n==Tarot gaming decks==\n{{Main article|Tarot card games}}\n[[File:Joueurs de tarot.JPG|thumb|200px|A French tarot game in session]]\nThe original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French variant in 1637.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=17-21}}</ref> The game of tarot has many regional variations. [[Tarocchini]] has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.\n\nThe 18th century saw tarot's greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the [[Rumelia|Ottoman Balkans]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214165-1|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetocar00parl}}</ref> [[French tarot]] experienced a revival beginning in the 1970s and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games\u2014often known as ''tarock'', ''tarok'', or ''tarokk'' are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]].\n\n===Italian-suited tarot decks===\n[[File:Tarot Piedmont 0.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tarocco Piemontese]]: the ''Fool'' card.]]\nThese were the oldest form of tarot deck to be made, being first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. The so-called occult tarot decks are based on decks of this type. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:\n* The [[Tarocco Piemontese]] consists of the four suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king, queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the [[pip cards]] for a total of 78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is numbered 0 despite not being a trump.\n* The [[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]] is similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno, and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese.\n* The [[Tarocco Bolognese]] omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62 cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].\n\n===Italo-Portuguese-suited tarot deck===\nThe '''[[Tarocco Siciliano]]''' is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips.<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-12.html Tarocco Siciliano, early form] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website. Retrieved 26 July 2015.</ref> Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, ''Miseria'' (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former [[stamp tax]]. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[[#cite note-8|<sup>[9]</sup>]]\n\n===French-suited tarot decks===\nThe illustrations of French-suited tarot trumps depart considerably from the older Italian-suited design, abandoning the Renaissance allegorical motifs. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for [[card games]]. The first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called \"[[Tiertarock]]\" ('Tier' being German for 'animal') appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with [[genre art]] or [[veduta]]. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:\n\n*The ''[[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]]'' (Industry and Luck) genre art tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. \n*The ''[[Cego|Adler-Cego]]'' animal tarot is used in the [[Rhine Rift Valley|Upper Rhine valley]] and its neighbouring hills such as the [[Black Forest]] or the [[Vosges]], and has 54 cards organized in the same fashion as the ''Industrie und Gl\u00fcck''. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices. \n*The ''[[Tarot Nouveau]]'' has 78 cards, and is commonly played in France and is somtimes used to play [[Cego]]. Its genre art trumps use Arabic numerals in corner indices.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Tiertarock Mannheim ca 1778.jpg|Example of 18th century \"[[Tiertarock]]\"\nFile:Salzburg Spielkarten c1840.jpg|Salzburg veduta trumps, circa 1840\nFile:Taroky trul.JPG|''[[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]]'' Tarock trumps\nFile:Adler-Cego trumps.jpg|[[Cego]] trumps\nFile:Oudlers1910.PNG|[[Tarot Nouveau]] trumps circa 1910\n</gallery>\n\n===German-suited tarot decks===\n[[German playing cards|German-suited decks]] for [[Bauerntarock]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg Tarock]] and [[Bavarian Tarock]] are different. They are not true tarot/tarock packs, but a [[Bavaria]]n or [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] pattern of the standard German-suited decks with only 36 cards; the [[pip card]]s ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (''[[Unter (playing card)|Unter]]''), Over Knave (''[[Ober (playing card)|Ober]]''), King, and Ace.

These new decks were called ''carte da trionfi'', triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], which became \"trumps\" in English. The earliest documentation of ''trionfi'' is found in a written statement in the court records of [[Florence]], in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=In Search of Tarot Sources|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=100}}</ref><ref>Pratesi, Franco.

He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \"trumps\" since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a ''novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus'', or \"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=Italian Cards - New Discoveries|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=18|issue=1, 2|pages=28-32, 33-38}}</ref> Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [[Sola Busca tarot|Sola-Busca]] and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.<ref name=\"DummettGame\"/>\n\nIn [[Florence]], an expanded deck called ''[[Minchiate]]'' was used.

It was only after the invention of the [[printing press]] that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [[Italian Wars]].

A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425.

[[Tarocchini]] has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.\n\nThe 18th century saw tarot's greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the [[Rumelia|Ottoman Balkans]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214165-1|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetocar00parl}}</ref> [[French tarot]] experienced a revival beginning in the 1970s and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games\u2014often known as ''tarock'', ''tarok'', or ''tarokk'' are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]].\n\n===Italian-suited tarot decks===\n[[File:Tarot Piedmont 0.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tarocco Piemontese]]: the ''Fool'' card.]]\nThese were the oldest form of tarot deck to be made, being first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. The so-called occult tarot decks are based on decks of this type. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:\n* The [[Tarocco Piemontese]] consists of the four suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king, queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the [[pip cards]] for a total of 78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is numbered 0 despite not being a trump.\n* The [[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]] is similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno, and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese.\n* The [[Tarocco Bolognese]] omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62 cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].\n\n===Italo-Portuguese-suited tarot deck===\nThe '''[[Tarocco Siciliano]]''' is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips.<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-12.html Tarocco Siciliano, early form] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website. Retrieved 26 July 2015.</ref> Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, ''Miseria'' (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former [[stamp tax]]. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[[#cite note-8|<sup>[9]</sup>]]\n\n===French-suited tarot decks===\nThe illustrations of French-suited tarot trumps depart considerably from the older Italian-suited design, abandoning the Renaissance allegorical motifs. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for [[card games]]. The first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called \"[[Tiertarock]]\" ('Tier' being German for 'animal') appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with [[genre art]] or [[veduta]]. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:\n\n*The ''[[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]]'' (Industry and Luck) genre art tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. \n*The ''[[Cego|Adler-Cego]]'' animal tarot is used in the [[Rhine Rift Valley|Upper Rhine valley]] and its neighbouring hills such as the [[Black Forest]] or the [[Vosges]], and has 54 cards organized in the same fashion as the ''Industrie und Gl\u00fcck''. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices. \n*The ''[[Tarot Nouveau]]'' has 78 cards, and is commonly played in France and is somtimes used to play [[Cego]]. Its genre art trumps use Arabic numerals in corner indices.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Tiertarock Mannheim ca 1778.jpg|Example of 18th century \"[[Tiertarock]]\"\nFile:Salzburg Spielkarten c1840.jpg|Salzburg veduta trumps, circa 1840\nFile:Taroky trul.JPG|''[[Industrie und Gl\u00fcck]]'' Tarock trumps\nFile:Adler-Cego trumps.jpg|[[Cego]] trumps\nFile:Oudlers1910.PNG|[[Tarot Nouveau]] trumps circa 1910\n</gallery>\n\n===German-suited tarot decks===\n[[German playing cards|German-suited decks]] for [[Bauerntarock]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg Tarock]] and [[Bavarian Tarock]] are different.

After it closed in 1969, it became what is now known as the [[Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley]].\n\n== History ==\nBrookley Air Force Base had its [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] beginnings with Mobile's first municipal airport, the original '''Bates Field'''. However, the site itself had been occupied from the time of Mobile's founding, starting with the home of Mobile's founding father, [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], in the early 18th century.<ref name=storymobile1>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', page 32. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. {{ISBN|0-940882-14-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] took over the then {{convert|1000|acre|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} Bates Field site and established the '''Brookley Army Air Field'''.<ref name=\"newhistory1\">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', page 213. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8173-1065-7}}</ref>  The military was attracted to the site because of the area's generally good flying weather and the bay-front location, but Alabama [[U.S. Congressman|Congressman]] [[Frank Boykin]]'s influence in [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] was important in convincing the [[United States Army|Army]] to locate the new military field in Mobile instead of [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref name=\"newhistory2\">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', page 210. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8173-1065-7}}</ref>  However, later that year, Tampa was also chosen for a military flying installation of its own, which would be named [[MacDill Field]], home of present-day [[MacDill Air Force Base]].\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Brookley Field Mobile Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|World War II scene at Brookley Army Air Field.]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Brookley Army Air Field became the major [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] supply base for the [[Air Material Command]] in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/><ref name=\"adahbrookley\">{{cite web |title=Alabama and World War II |work=Alabama Department of Archives and History |url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec50det.html |accessdate=2007-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807131752/http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec50det.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nMany air depot personnel, logisticians, mechanics, and other support personnel were trained at Brookley during the war.  Both Air Materiel and Technical Services Command organized mobile Depot Groups at Brookley, then once trained were deployed around the world as Air Depot Groups, Depot Repair Squadrons, Quartermaster Squadrons, Ordnance Maintenance, Military Police, and many other units whose mission was to support the front-line combat units with depot-level maintenance for aircraft and logistical support to maintain their operations.  [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] operated large numbers of cargo and passenger aircraft from the base as part of its Domestic Wing.\n\nDuring the war, Brookley became Mobile's largest employer, with about 17,000 skilled civilians capable of performing delicate work with fragile instruments and machinery.  In 1944, the Army decided to take advantage of Brookley's \nlarge, skilled workforce for its top-secret \"Ivory Soap\" project to hasten victory in the Pacific. The project required 24 large vessels to be re-modeled into Aircraft Repair and Maintenance Units that had to be able to accommodate B-29 bombers, P-51 Mustangs, R-4B Sikorsky helicopters, and amphibious vehicles.<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/><ref name=\"adahbrookley\"/>\n\nThe Air Force delivered all 24 vessels to Mobile, Alabama, in spring 1944 to start remodeling. Some 5,000 men \nunderwent a complex training process that prepared them to rebuild the vessels and operate them once on the water. By the end of the year, the vessels departed Mobile.\n\nOne of the keys to Allied victory in Europe was the Norden Bomb Sight, which enabled bomber squadrons to target Germany's war-making industry and infrastructure much more accurately.  The military repaired and calibrated the bombsights at Brookley in a secret facility, still standing and in use today.\n\nIn 1944 with the closure of the Army contract flying school at nearby [[Bates Army Airfield]],  Air Transport Command operations were shifted to Bates to alleviate runway traffic at Brookley.    Late in 1945 Bates Field was returned to civil control and ATC operations returned to Brookley.\n\n===Postwar use===\nFollowing World War II and the creation of an independent [[United States Air Force]], the installation became '''Brookley Air Force Base'''.   In 1947 with the closure of Morrison Field, Florida,  the [[C-74 Globemaster]] project was moved to Brookley.   The C-74 was, at the time, the largest military transport aircraft in the world.  It was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft]] after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The long distances across the Atlantic, and especially the Pacific Ocean to the combat areas indicated a need for a transoceanic heavy-lift military transport aircraft.\n\n[[File:1701st Air Transport Wing Douglas C-74 Globemaster at Brookley AFB.jpg|thumb|left|1701st Air Transport Wing Douglas C-74 Globemaster at Brookley AFB in the early 1950s]]\nThe \"C-74 squadron\" (later 521st Air Transport Group, [[1701st Air Transport Wing]]), [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] operated two squadrons of C-74 Globemasters from Brookley from 1947 until their retirement in 1955.  The eleven aircraft were used extensively for worldwide transport of personnel and equipment, supporting United States military missions.  They saw extensive service supporting the [[Berlin Airlift]] and the [[Korean War]] being used on scheduled [[Military Air Transport Service|MATS]] overseas routes through the late 1940s and mid-1950s.  Additionally, logistic support flights for [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), and [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) saw the Globemaster in North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the Caribbean, and within the United States. Two C-74s were used to support the first TAC [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]] flight across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. SAC also continued to use the Globemasters to rotate [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] Medium Bombardment Groups on temporary duty in England and Morocco as part of their REFLEX operation.  The C-74s were retired in 1955 due to lack of logistical support. The 1701st ATW flew strategic airlift missions on a worldwide scale with its [[C-124 Globemaster II]] fleet after the retirement of the C-74 until 1957 when Military Air Transport Service moved out of Brookley AFB and the base came under the full jurisdiction of Air Material Command.\n\nIn 1962, the Air Material Command was renamed as the [[Air Force Logistics Command]] ([[Air Force Logistics Command|AFLC]]) and Brookley AFB became an AFLC installation and the host base of the modification and repair center's successor organization, the '''Mobile Air Materiel Area''' (MOAMA).\n\nAfter an immediate end to many of the wartime jobs of World War II, the base's civilian workforce again expanded to around 16,000 people by 1962, a result of both the [[Cold War]] and other [[USAF]] base closings in other areas of the country.<ref name=\"newhistory3\">Thomason, Michael.

However, the site itself had been occupied from the time of Mobile's founding, starting with the home of Mobile's founding father, [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], in the early 18th century.<ref name=storymobile1>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', page 32. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. {{ISBN|0-940882-14-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] took over the then {{convert|1000|acre|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} Bates Field site and established the '''Brookley Army Air Field'''.<ref name=\"newhistory1\">Thomason, Michael.

Both Air Materiel and Technical Services Command organized mobile Depot Groups at Brookley, then once trained were deployed around the world as Air Depot Groups, Depot Repair Squadrons, Quartermaster Squadrons, Ordnance Maintenance, Military Police, and many other units whose mission was to support the front-line combat units with depot-level maintenance for aircraft and logistical support to maintain their operations.  [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] operated large numbers of cargo and passenger aircraft from the base as part of its Domestic Wing.\n\nDuring the war, Brookley became Mobile's largest employer, with about 17,000 skilled civilians capable of performing delicate work with fragile instruments and machinery.  In 1944, the Army decided to take advantage of Brookley's \nlarge, skilled workforce for its top-secret \"Ivory Soap\" project to hasten victory in the Pacific. The project required 24 large vessels to be re-modeled into Aircraft Repair and Maintenance Units that had to be able to accommodate B-29 bombers, P-51 Mustangs, R-4B Sikorsky helicopters, and amphibious vehicles.<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/><ref name=\"adahbrookley\"/>\n\nThe Air Force delivered all 24 vessels to Mobile, Alabama, in spring 1944 to start remodeling. Some 5,000 men \nunderwent a complex training process that prepared them to rebuild the vessels and operate them once on the water. By the end of the year, the vessels departed Mobile.\n\nOne of the keys to Allied victory in Europe was the Norden Bomb Sight, which enabled bomber squadrons to target Germany's war-making industry and infrastructure much more accurately.  The military repaired and calibrated the bombsights at Brookley in a secret facility, still standing and in use today.\n\nIn 1944 with the closure of the Army contract flying school at nearby [[Bates Army Airfield]],  Air Transport Command operations were shifted to Bates to alleviate runway traffic at Brookley.    Late in 1945 Bates Field was returned to civil control and ATC operations returned to Brookley.\n\n===Postwar use===\nFollowing World War II and the creation of an independent [[United States Air Force]], the installation became '''Brookley Air Force Base'''.   In 1947 with the closure of Morrison Field, Florida,  the [[C-74 Globemaster]] project was moved to Brookley.   The C-74 was, at the time, the largest military transport aircraft in the world.  It was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft]] after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The long distances across the Atlantic, and especially the Pacific Ocean to the combat areas indicated a need for a transoceanic heavy-lift military transport aircraft.\n\n[[File:1701st Air Transport Wing Douglas C-74 Globemaster at Brookley AFB.jpg|thumb|left|1701st Air Transport Wing Douglas C-74 Globemaster at Brookley AFB in the early 1950s]]\nThe \"C-74 squadron\" (later 521st Air Transport Group, [[1701st Air Transport Wing]]), [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] operated two squadrons of C-74 Globemasters from Brookley from 1947 until their retirement in 1955.  The eleven aircraft were used extensively for worldwide transport of personnel and equipment, supporting United States military missions.  They saw extensive service supporting the [[Berlin Airlift]] and the [[Korean War]] being used on scheduled [[Military Air Transport Service|MATS]] overseas routes though the late 1940s and mid-1950s.  Additionally, logistic support flights for [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), and [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) saw the Globemaster in North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the Caribbean, and within the United States. Two C-74s were used to support the first TAC [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]] flight across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. SAC also continued to use the Globemasters to rotate [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] Medium Bombardment Groups on temporary duty in England and Morocco as part of their REFLEX operation.  The C-74s were retired in 1955 due to lack of logistical support. The 1701st ATW flew strategic airlift missions on a worldwide scale with its [[C-124 Globemaster II]] fleet after the retirement of the C-74 until 1957 when Military Air Transport Service moved out of Brookley AFB and the base came under the full jurisdiction of Air Material Command.\n\nIn 1962, the Air Material Command was renamed as the [[Air Force Logistics Command]] ([[Air Force Logistics Command|AFLC]]) and Brookley AFB became an AFLC installation and the host base of the modification and repair center's successor organization, the '''Mobile Air Materiel Area''' (MOAMA).\n\nAfter an immediate end to many of the wartime jobs of World War II, the base's civilian workforce again expanded to around 16,000 people by 1962, a result of both the [[Cold War]] and other [[USAF]] base closings in other areas of the country.<ref name=\"newhistory3\">Thomason, Michael.

Twenty five miles downstream from the falls, the Tampaon meanders past the ancient pyramid site of Tamtoc. Archaeologists believe that [[Tamtoc]] is the northernmost pre-Columbian city with pyramids in Mexico, and some speculate that it could be the place of origin of the Aztecs from which they launched their migration to the Valley of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terraeantiqvae.blogia.com/2005/052804-tamtoc-la-mitica-aztlan.php |title=Tamtoc, la m\u00edtica Aztl\u00e1n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212023444/http://terraeantiqvae.blogia.com/2005/052804-tamtoc-la-mitica-aztlan.php |archivedate=12 December 2009 |website=Terrae Antiquae}}</ref> The best time to visit the waterfall is during the low water season from July to October, when it is easily accessible.\n\n===Tancanhuitz de Santos===\nThis town is located {{convert|65|km|mi|sp=us}} from Ciudad Valles.

It is located in the eastern part of the state ({{coord|21|59|00|N|99|1|0|W}}), in the cultural region of [[Huasteca]]. The city is also the municipal seat of the surrounding [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of the same name. The city had a 2014 census population of 176,935.\n\n==Government==\n\nCiudad Valles is a municipality governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President) or Mayor for a period of three years with no right to reelection.\n\n==Climate==\n\nCiudad Valles has a humid tropical climate. During the summer from April to October, Ciudad Valles experiences high temperatures. The all time high temperature is {{convert|48.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} along with a consistent humidity. In the winter Ciudad Valles has mild temperatures; a few times a year the thermometer registers less than {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} The all time low is {{convert|0|C|F}}.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe [[Pan-American Highway]] or Interamerican Highway built in the 1930s represents Ciudad Valles' most vital corridor. The Highway leads north to [[Nuevo Laredo]] via [[Monterrey]], and to the south to [[Mexico City]].\n\nCiudad Valles connects San Luis Potos\u00ed with [[Tampico]]. Both cities are politically and economically interrelated with Ciudad Valles.\n\n==Tourism in Ciudad Valles==\n\nCiudad Valles is one of Mexico's most popular destinations for tourists.\n\n===Micos waterfall===\nThese waterfalls are famous due to their steep falls in the middle of hills surrounded by vegetation.\n\nThese waterfalls are located {{convert|18|km|mi|sp=us}} from Ciudad Valles and are part of Tampaon river, best known as the Micos River. This name was given due to the abundance of spider monkeys that inhabited this area. This river goes down through a large series of falls with a vertiginous acceleration. Rafting through the rapids of this river is a popular activity. At the top of the waterfall there is a scenic viewpoint.\n\n===Tamasopo===\n[[File:Tamasopo7.jpg|thumb|right|220px|View of the Tamasopo Falls in San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n\nAnother destination for adventure tourism for the [[Verastegui Sierra]], where the spectacle of the ''Espinazo del Diablo'' (Backbone of the Devil) and its ravines which are up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep can be seen.
