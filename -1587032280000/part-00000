{"title_page": "1922 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that of the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, these communities, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and the Omeragaj of Shala came to form the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that of the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area.

The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

They were the first of the [[Indian Railways WCAM class|WCAM series]]. These locos were operational in routes around Mumbai. These locomotives worked on both AC as well as DC as their classification suggested.<ref name=IRFCA/> They hauled trains from DC section of suburban railway to AC section and thus performed a very critical task as they could easily operate on both AC and DC. However they performed poorly in DC mode compared to AC mode but they were very robust and had easy operating and handling characteristics. \nThese were 1st class of Wide Gauge's(W) Bi-current charged(CA - runs both under AC and DC) and Mixed load series(M - hauls both passenger and freight trains). These were the first electric locomotives to enter Western Railway's Mumbai division; prior to that steam and diesel locomotives used to haul trains in Western Railway's Mumbai division. These brought an end to the steam era in this division. They were also the first locomotives allotted to [[Valsad railway station|Valsad]] (BL) shed. Their top speed under DC was the lowest, as compared to other Bi-current charged locomotives. They were the first Bi-current charged locomotives in the country. Initially all were vacuum braked but were retrofitted with air brakes to make them [[Vacuum brake#Dual brakes|dual braked]]. Some also had their vacuum brakes replaced with air brakes. Introduced in 1975. One of the single pantographs on the WCAM-1 is used in dc traction; the other one carries ac current. The two pantographs were not identical, though similar in design. Originally built with vacuum brakes only, although a few (Nos. 21805, 21807, 21812, 21828, 21838, 21844, 21845, and 21850) had both vacuum and air brakes. They lacked dynamic brakes. The WCAM-1 did not use a variable ratio auto-transformer in AC mode like the others; it used a fixed-ratio transformer and rectifier bank to convert the OHE supply to 1500\u00a0V DC. The design of the transformers and notches made this a hard machine to operate, with the fusible links tending to blow often. Of the 28 notches, notches 4, 14, 21, and 28 were used for continuous operation, although notch 4 was intended for low-speed shunting and was very ineffective. Notches 14, 21, and 28 were the terminal notches of the series, series-parallel, and parallel circuit notch sequences. In DC mode, the WCAM-1 used resistor banks for speed control. However they were very robust machines and relatively easy in the handling characteristics. WCAM-1's had three traction modes (series, series-parallel, parallel) in both DC and AC mode, but using the parallel mode in DC was discouraged because of power problems. In practice this was not restrictive since series-parallel notches allowed reaching 75&nbsp;km/h or so. In AC mode, the locos were almost always used with the motors in all-parallel mode. Unlike the WCAM-2 and WCAM-3 locos, no reconfiguration has been carried out to force the use of all-parallel mode with AC. Weak field operation was available. They were briefly tried out for freight use by CR, but all finally ended up with WR. The top ones getting the WCAM-2P (see below). [5/02] However,CR's Indore-Pune weekly train had been hauled by a WR WCAM-1. Max. speed 100&nbsp;km/h, 110&nbsp;km/h after regearing. Traction motors were nose-suspended and axle-hung.\n\n==Technical specifications<ref name=IRFCA>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco-electric-dc.html#WCAM-1 WCAM-1] at Indian Railways Fan Club</ref>==\n\nOf all the 30 notches, 1-21 were DC notches allowing series operation of traction motors. Rest of the 8 notches allow series-parallel combination under DC. Under AC, the combinations were 3S-2P and 2S-3P. These locomotives could run in parallel combination but it was discouraged due to power problems under DC. Under AC, the locomotives were run under parallel notches nearly always. Although these engines were not rebuilt to use only parallel combination under AC. [[Field weakening]] of traction motors was possible at 21st and 30th notches. Voltage control was done by Tap changer operation under AC and Resistance notching under DC. Traction motors were charged by DC. Its prototypes were tested in the year 1971.<ref name=\"IRFCA history\">{{cite web|title=IRFCA history|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history5.html}}</ref><ref name=\"IRFCA electric loco specs\">{{cite web|title=IRFCA electric loco specs|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs2.html}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Traction Motors\n|Alstom/CLW TAO 659 A1 {{convert|2800|kg|abbr=on}}.

They were the first of the [[Indian Railways WCAM class|WCAM series]]. These locos were operational in routes around Mumbai. These locomotives worked on both AC as well as DC as their classification suggested.<ref name=IRFCA/> They hauled trains from DC section of suburban railway to AC section and thus performed a very critical task as they could easily operate on both AC and DC. However they performed poorly in DC mode compared to AC mode but they were very robust and had easy operating and handling characteristics. \nThese were 1st class of Wide Gauge's(W) Bi-current charged(CA - runs both under AC and DC) and Mixed load series(M - hauls both passenger and freight trains). These were the first electric locomotives to enter Western Railway's Mumbai division; prior to that steam and diesel locomotives used to haul trains in Western Railway's Mumbai division. These brought an end to the steam era in this division. They were also the first locomotives allotted to [[Valsad railway station|Valsad]] (BL) shed. Their top speed under DC was the lowest, as compared to other Bi-current charged locomotives. They were the first Bi-current charged locomotives in the country. Initially all were vacuum braked but were retrofitted with air brakes to make them [[Vacuum brake#Dual brakes|dual braked]]. Some also had their vacuum brakes replaced with air brakes. Introduced in 1975. One of the single pantographs on the WCAM-1 is used in dc traction; the other one carries ac current. The two pantographs were not identical, though similar in design. Originally built with vacuum brakes only, although a few (Nos. 21805, 21807, 21812, 21828, 21838, 21844, 21845, and 21850) had both vacuum and air brakes. They lacked dynamic brakes. The WCAM-1 did not use a variable ratio auto-transformer in AC mode like the others; it used a fixed-ratio transformer and rectifier bank to convert the OHE supply to 1500\u00a0V DC. The design of the transformers and notches made this a hard machine to operate, with the fusible links tending to blow often. Of the 28 notches, notches 4, 14, 21, and 28 were used for continuous operation, although notch 4 was intended for low-speed shunting and was very ineffective. Notches 14, 21, and 28 were the terminal notches of the series, series-parallel, and parallel circuit notch sequences. In DC mode, the WCAM-1 used resistor banks for speed control. However they were very robust machines and relatively easy in the handling characteristics. WCAM-1's had three traction modes (series, series-parallel, parallel) in both DC and AC mode, but using the parallel mode in DC was discouraged because of power problems. In practice this was not restrictive since series-parallel notches allowed reaching 75&nbsp;km/h or so. In AC mode, the locos were almost always used with the motors in all-parallel mode. Unlike the WCAM-2 and WCAM-3 locos, no reconfiguration has been carried out to force the use of all-parallel mode with AC. Weak field operation was available. They were briefly tried out for freight use by CR, but all finally ended up with WR. The top ones getting the WCAM-2P (see below). [5/02] However,CR's Indore-Pune weekly train had been hauled by a WR WCAM-1. Max. speed 100&nbsp;km/h, 110&nbsp;km/h after regearing. Traction motors were nose-suspended and axle-hung.\n\n==Technical specifications<ref name=IRFCA>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco-electric-dc.html#WCAM-1 WCAM-1] at Indian Railways Fan Club</ref>==\n\nOf all the 30 notches, 1-21 were DC notches allowing series operation of traction motors. Rest of the 8 notches allow series-parallel combination under DC. Under AC, the combinations were 3S-2P and 2S-3P. These locomotives could run in parallel combination but it was discouraged due to power problems under DC. Under AC, the locomotives were run under parallel notches nearly always. Although these engines were not rebuilt to use only parallel combination under AC. [[Field weakening]] of traction motors was possible at 21st and 30th notches. Voltage control was done by Tap changer operation under AC and Resistance notching under DC. Traction motors were charged by DC. Its prototypes were tested in the year 1971.<ref name=\"IRFCA history\">{{cite web|title=IRFCA history|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history5.html}}</ref><ref name=\"IRFCA electric loco specs\">{{cite web|title=IRFCA electric loco specs|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs2.html}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Traction Motors\n|Alstom/CLW TAO 659 A1 {{convert|2800|kg|abbr=on}}.

The village of Sandy Hook includes the communities of Berkshire, Riverside, Walnut Tree Hill, and Zoar, which also extends for a short distance into the Town of Monroe along Old Zoar Road and Bagburn Hill/Jordan Hill Road.\n\n==History==\nWithin a year of the settlement of Newtown, some of its proprietors began moving away from the central village to some of their larger parcels. Several proprietors with land in the same area relocated to these areas together to reduce isolation. Sandy Hook was one of the first of the outlying areas settled. Colonists found the [[Pootatuck River]] at Sandy Hook allowed for the setting up of saw and grist mills.

The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.<ref name=\"understanding-2\">{{cite journal |author1=Sachs, D.

Part of the reason being that manufacturing and services and not agriculture are the engines of growth. The more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.<ref name=\"understanding-2\">{{cite journal |author1=Sachs, D.

The [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] would win  the league championship with a record of ten wins, two losses and take over the  [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==League business==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\n\n===Executive===\n* Joe Power, Quebec (President)\n* James Strachan, Wanderers (1st Vice-President)\n* J.

At the meeting the two last amateur, or at least partly amateur teams resigned over the signing of players from other teams. [[Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal HC]] and [[Montreal Victorias]] left the league and later would continue as senior level men's teams playing for the [[Allan Cup]]. Unpaid players would no longer play with paid players.\n\nThe league would continue with four professional teams. The league name was changed to '''Eastern Canadian Hockey Association''' to reflect the change in status.\n\n==Regular season==\nThe Wanderers', [[Cecil Blachford]] had retired and [[Bruce Stuart]] had moved to Ottawa. New additions included [[Joe Hall]], [[Harry Smith (ice hockey, born 1883)|Harry Smith]], Jimmy Gardner and Steve Vair. The Wanderers would come close to their rivals, finishing second with nine wins and three losses.\n\nOttawa saw [[Harvey Pulford]] and [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] retire, and Tom Phillips leave. Ottawa would replace these players with [[Edgar Dey]], [[Billy Gilmour (ice hockey)|Billy Gilmour]] and [[Albert Kerr|Albert 'Dubby' Kerr]] from the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]]. Alf Smith would organize the [[Ottawa Senators (FHL)|Ottawa Senators]] of the [[Federal Amateur Hockey League|Federal Hockey League]].\n\nShamrocks added [[Harry Hyland]], and Quebec saw the start of the career of [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]].\n\nOttawa played an exhibition game prior to the season with the Toronto professionals on January 2 in Toronto.

Ottawa would win the next 5\u20134 in Ottawa, and defeat Montreal in Montreal 9\u20138 before 8000 fans. Ottawa would finish the series winning 8\u20133 in Ottawa to clinch the championship.\n\n[[Marty Walsh (ice hockey)|Marty Walsh]] of Ottawa would win the scoring championship with 38 goals.

Teams played a twelve-game schedule. The [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] would win  the league championship with a record of ten wins, two losses and take over the  [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==League business==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\n\n===Executive===\n* Joe Power, Quebec (President)\n* James Strachan, Wanderers (1st Vice-President)\n* J. Eveleigh, Montreal (2nd Vice-President)\n* [[Emmett Quinn]], Quebec (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nThe [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] league meeting was held November 4, 1908, and was a pivotal meeting in the evolution from amateur to professional ice hockey leagues. At the meeting the two last amateur, or at least partly amateur teams resigned over the signing of players from other teams. [[Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal HC]] and [[Montreal Victorias]] left the league and later would continue as senior level men's teams playing for the [[Allan Cup]]. Unpaid players would no longer play with paid players.\n\nThe league would continue with four professional teams. The league name was changed to '''Eastern Canadian Hockey Association''' to reflect the change in status.\n\n==Regular season==\nThe Wanderers', [[Cecil Blachford]] had retired and [[Bruce Stuart]] had moved to Ottawa. New additions included [[Joe Hall]], [[Harry Smith (ice hockey, born 1883)|Harry Smith]], Jimmy Gardner and Steve Vair. The Wanderers would come close to their rivals, finishing second with nine wins and three losses.\n\nOttawa saw [[Harvey Pulford]] and [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] retire, and Tom Phillips leave. Ottawa would replace these players with [[Edgar Dey]], [[Billy Gilmour (ice hockey)|Billy Gilmour]] and [[Albert Kerr|Albert 'Dubby' Kerr]] from the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]]. Alf Smith would organize the [[Ottawa Senators (FHL)|Ottawa Senators]] of the [[Federal Amateur Hockey League|Federal Hockey League]].\n\nShamrocks added [[Harry Hyland]], and Quebec saw the start of the career of [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]].\n\nOttawa played an exhibition game prior to the season with the Toronto professionals on January 2 in Toronto.

Ottawa would win the next 5\u20134 in Ottawa, and defeat Montreal in Montreal 9\u20138 before 8000 fans. Ottawa would finish the series winning 8\u20133 in Ottawa to clinch the championship.\n\n[[Marty Walsh (ice hockey)|Marty Walsh]] of Ottawa would win the scoring championship with 38 goals.

In game one, Harry Smith scored 5 goals as he led the Wanderers to a 7\u20133 victory.

(The Shamrocks would fold before the next season and never played a challenge.)

These factors formed a rationale for the implementation of the Green Revolution as a development strategy in India.\n\n=== Frequent famines ===\nIn 1964-65 and 1965\u201366, India experienced two severe droughts which led to food shortages and famines among the country's growing population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sangha|first=Kamaljit Kaur|date=2014|title=Modern agricultural practices and analysis of socio-economic and ecological impacts of development in agriculture sector, Punjab, India - A review|journal=Indian Journal of Agricultural Research|volume=48|issue=5|pages=331|doi=10.5958/0976-058x.2014.01312.2|issn=0367-8245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2c0365b5e0f885da15f5c52ff2f6c858a7db564e}}</ref> Modern agricultural technologies appeared to offer strategies to counter the frequency of famines.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|title=Green revolution : history, impact and future|last=Jain, H.

They took loans from [[landlords]], who charged high rates of [[interest]]s and also exploited the farmers later on to work in their fields to repay the loans ([[farm labourer]]s).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Proper financing was not given during the Green Revolution period, which created a lot of problems and sufferings to the farmers of India. Government also helped those under loans.\n\n=== Low Productivity ===\nIn the context of India's rapidly growing population, the country's traditional agricultural practices yielded insufficient food production. By the 1960s, this low productivity led India to experience food grain shortages that were more severe than those of other developing countries. Agricultural technological advancements offered opportunities to increase productivity.<ref name=\":22\"/>\n\n== Criticisms of the Green Revolution ==\nThe Green Revolution yielded great economic prosperity during its early years. In Punjab, where it was first introduced, the Green Revolution led to significant increases in the state's agricultural output, supporting India\u2019s overall economy. By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains,<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=Jashandeep Singh|date=2014|title=Green Revolution: A Case Study of Punjab|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=75|pages=1192\u20131199|via=JSTOR}}</ref> and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent.<ref name=\":02\" /> Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceofgreen00shiv|title=The Violence of the green revolution : ecological degredation and political conflict|last=Shiva, Vandana.|date=1991|publisher=Zed|isbn=0-86232-964-7|oclc=24740968|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India.\n\n=== Indian Economic Sovereignty ===\nCriticism of the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying [[Monsanto]] BT cotton seeds\u2014sold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans\u2014typically at high interest rates.<ref name=\":12\"/> Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist [[Vandana Shiva]] writes that this is the \"second Green Revolution\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest \u2013 notably MNCs like Monsanto\u2014as encourage by the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFarmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates.<ref name=\":12\" /> Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole.<ref name=\":12\" /> According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-suicides-unabated-in-punjab-over-900-in-2-years/727671.html|title=Farm suicides unabated in Punjab, over 900 in 2 years|last=Bharti|first=Vishav|date=Feb 12, 2019|work=The Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental Damage ===\nExcessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused [[overexploitation|over-use]] of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual [[soil degradation]]. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals.[https://sol.du.ac.in/mod/book/view.php?id=1735&chapterid=1695]\n\n=== Increased Regional disparities ===\nThe green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out.\n\nThe states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{India topics}}\n{{Agriculture in India}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural revolutions]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture in India]]\n[[Category:Intensive farming]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of India]]\n[[Category:Economic history of India]]\n[[Category:Indira Gandhi administration]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, India (1947\u2013present)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Punjab Monsoon.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] led India's [[Green Revolution]] and earned the distinction of being the country's wheat basket.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073911/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | url-status= live}} Section: \"The Green Revolution\", pp. 17\u201320.</ref>]]\n\nThe '''Green Revolution in India''' refers to a period when Indian [[agriculture in India|agriculture]] was converted into an industrial system due to the adoption of modern methods and technology such as the use of [[High-yielding variety|high yielding variety (HYV) seeds]], tractors, irrigation facilities, pesticides, and fertilizers.

Due to the rise in use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, there was a negative effect on the [[soil]] and the land (e.g., [[land degradation]]).\n\n=== Other practices ===\n{{Prose|section|date=January 2018}}\n* [[Irrigation]] infrastructure\n* Use of [[pesticides]]\n** Use of [[insecticides]]\n** Use of [[herbicide]]s\n* Consolidation of [[Possession (law)|holdings]]\n* [[Land reforms]]\n* Improved [[rural infrastructure]]\n* Supply of agricultural [[credit (finance)|credit]]\n* Use of chemical or [[synthetic fertilizers]]\n* Use of [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinklers]] or [[drip irrigation]] systems\n* Use of advanced [[machinery]]\n* Use of [[vector quantity]]\n\n== Rationale for the Green Revolution ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nThe Green Revolution in India was first introduced in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] in the late 1960s as part of a development program issued by international donor agencies and the Government of India.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Dutta|first=Swarup|date=June 2012|title=Green Revolution Revisited: The Contemporary Agrarian Situation in Punjab, India|journal=Social Change|volume=42|issue=2|pages=229\u2013247|doi=10.1177/004908571204200205|issn=0049-0857}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], India's grain economy hinged on a unilateral relation of exploitation.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=Late Victorian holocausts : El Ni\u00f1o famines and the making of the Third World|last=Davis, Mike, 1946- author.|isbn=978-1-78168-360-6|oclc=1051845720|year = 2017}}</ref> Consequently, when India gained independence, the weakened country quickly became vulnerable to frequent famines, financial instabilities, and low productivity. These factors formed a rationale for the implementation of the Green Revolution as a development strategy in India.\n\n=== Frequent famines ===\nIn 1964-65 and 1965\u201366, India experienced two severe droughts which led to food shortages and famines among the country's growing population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sangha|first=Kamaljit Kaur|date=2014|title=Modern agricultural practices and analysis of socio-economic and ecological impacts of development in agriculture sector, Punjab, India - A review|journal=Indian Journal of Agricultural Research|volume=48|issue=5|pages=331|doi=10.5958/0976-058x.2014.01312.2|issn=0367-8245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2c0365b5e0f885da15f5c52ff2f6c858a7db564e}}</ref> Modern agricultural technologies appeared to offer strategies to counter the frequency of famines.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|title=Green revolution : history, impact and future|last=Jain, H.

They took loans from [[landlords]], who charged high rates of [[interest]]s and also exploited the farmers later on to work in their fields to repay the loans ([[farm labourer]]s).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Proper financing was not given during the Green Revolution period, which created a lot of problems and sufferings to the farmers of India. Government also helped those under loans.\n\n=== Low Productivity ===\nIn the context of India's rapidly growing population, the country's traditional agricultural practices yielded insufficient food production. By the 1960s, this low productivity led India to experience food grain shortages that were more severe than those of other developing countries. Agricultural technological advancements offered opportunities to increase productivity.<ref name=\":22\"/>\n\n== Criticisms of the Green Revolution ==\nThe Green Revolution yielded great economic prosperity during its early years. In Punjab, where it was first introduced, the Green Revolution led to significant increases in the state's agricultural output, supporting India\u2019s overall economy. By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains,<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=Jashandeep Singh|date=2014|title=Green Revolution: A Case Study of Punjab|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=75|pages=1192\u20131199|via=JSTOR}}</ref> and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent.<ref name=\":02\" /> Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceofgreen00shiv|title=The Violence of the green revolution : ecological degredation and political conflict|last=Shiva, Vandana.|date=1991|publisher=Zed|isbn=0-86232-964-7|oclc=24740968|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India.\n\n=== Indian Economic Sovereignty ===\nCriticism of the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying [[Monsanto]] BT cotton seeds\u2014sold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans\u2014typically at high interest rates.<ref name=\":12\"/> Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist [[Vandana Shiva]] writes that this is the \"second Green Revolution\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest \u2013 notably MNCs like Monsanto\u2014as encourage by the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFarmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates.<ref name=\":12\" /> Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole.<ref name=\":12\" /> According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-suicides-unabated-in-punjab-over-900-in-2-years/727671.html|title=Farm suicides unabated in Punjab, over 900 in 2 years|last=Bharti|first=Vishav|date=Feb 12, 2019|work=The Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental Damage ===\nExcessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused [[overexploitation|over-use]] of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual [[soil degradation]]. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals.[https://sol.du.ac.in/mod/book/view.php?id=1735&chapterid=1695]\n\n=== Increased Regional disparities ===\nThe green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out.\n\nThe states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{India topics}}\n{{Agriculture in India}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural revolutions]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture in India]]\n[[Category:Intensive farming]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of India]]\n[[Category:Economic history of India]]\n[[Category:Indira Gandhi administration]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, India (1947\u2013present)]]\n", "name_user": "Priyadarshi Mukhopadhyay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_in_India"}
