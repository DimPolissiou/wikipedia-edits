His ecclesiastical studies were completed at the [[The Scots College (Rome)|Pontifical Scots College]], and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.\n\n==Priesthood==\nTartaglia was [[ordination|ordained]] [[priest]] by Archbishop [[Thomas Winning]] at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, [[Dennistoun]] on 30 June 1975. He then returned to Rome where he completed his ordinary course of studies in 1976 before beginning research for his doctorate in Sacred Theology. In 1978 he was additionally appointed as dean of studies at the Scots College in Rome, and was also acting vice-rector at that time.\n\nAfter obtaining his [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|STD]] degree in 1980, on the [[Council of Trent]]'s teaching on the [[Eucharist]], he was appointed assistant priest at Our Lady of Lourdes, [[Cardonald]], while at the same time becoming an extramural lecturer at St. Peter's College, [[Newlands, Glasgow|Newlands]], Glasgow.\n\nA year later, he was appointed lecturer at St. Peter's College, becoming director of studies in 1983. When Chesters College, [[Bearsden]], opened in 1985 he was made vice-rector. In 1987 he was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]].\n\nHe served as rector until 1993 when he was sent to St. Patrick's, [[Dumbarton]], as assistant priest before being appointed parish priest of St Mary's, [[Duntocher]] in 1995. In 2004 the [[Bishops' Conference of Scotland]] asked him to return to seminary as rector of the Pontifical Scots College, Rome.\n\n==Episcopate==\nOn 13 September 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] nominated Tartaglia as Bishop of Paisley.  On 20 November 2005 the [[Feast of Christ the King|Solemnity of Christ the King]], he was consecrated in [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] by [[Archbishop Mario Conti]]. The co-consecrating bishops were Archbishop [[Raymond Leo Burke]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|St Louis]], [[Missouri]] ([[United States]]) and Bishop [[John Mone]], Emeritus Bishop of Paisley.\n\nIn 2006 he attracted controversy for attacking UK law relating to the family. He outlined his opinion that the [[Family Law Act 1996]], which made [[divorce]] quicker and easier, [[civil partnership]] legislation giving homosexual relationships legal status, and the [[Gender Recognition Act]], allowing people to change their gender designation, undermined the family in society: \"Unfortunately, in our times, the minds of many have been so darkened by hubris and by the selfish pursuit of their own gratification that they have lost sight of the natural law which God has written into his creation...\".<ref>\"Bishop lays down the law to Labour\", p. 3, ''[[The Catholic Times (UK and Ireland)|The Catholic Times]]'', 15 October 2006.</ref> He reiterated this in 2010 when he wrote to [[David Cameron]] to insist that \"the Catholic Church will not register civil partnerships nor celebrate same-sex unions: not now, not in the future, not ever, no matter what legislation or regulations your government enacts or endorses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Writer |first=Staff |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/07/23/catholic-church-will-never-recognise-gay-marriage-bishop-tells-cameron |title=Catholic Church will \u2018never\u2019 recognise gay marriage, bishop tells Cameron |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> He also criticised the UK government's decision to upgrade its [[nuclear weapon]]s capability.\n\nIn 2008, as president of the National Communications Commission of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland, he wrote to every parish in Scotland decrying the media for pushing a \u201csecular and humanistic agenda\u201d. Arguing his belief that \"over two thirds\" of Scots are actually Christians, and that the proportion of people who work the media does not reflect this, leading to a \"fundamental disconnection between the provider and the consumer\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 2008 Tartaglia was mooted by some commentators as a possible successor to the [[Archdiocese of Westminster|see of Westminster]], albeit with an outside chance. In the event the new appointee was Archbishop [[Vincent Nichols]].<ref name=\"timesonline1\"/>\n\nOn 24 July 2012 the [[Holy See]] announced the appointment of Tartaglia as [[Archbishop of Glasgow]] to succeed Archbishop Mario Conti. He took possession of the diocese on 8 September 2012, the [[Nativity of Mary|Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\nOn 29 June 2013, Tartaglia received the [[pallium]] from [[Pope Francis]] at a Mass in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], on the liturgical [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul]].\n\n==Comments on homosexuality==\nIn April 2012 he participated in a conference on religious freedom and tolerance, held at [[Oxford University]]. In response to a point made by a member of the audience, Tartaglia raised the death of \"a gay Catholic MP who died at the age of 44\", a likely reference to [[David Cairns (politician)|David Cairns]], whose death from [[pancreatitis]] he claimed was potentially due to his sexuality. He went on to imply that the connection was being avoided, saying \"...nobody said anything...and why his body should just shut down at that age, obviously he could have had a disease which would have killed anyone, but you seem to hear so many stories about this kind of thing, but society won't address it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18980379 |title=BBC News - Archbishop Philip Tartaglia's gay MP remark 'adds to family's grief' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Cairns's partner Dermot Kehoe criticised him for making a claim for which was contradicted by the medical evidence, and for adding to the grief suffered by the family of the deceased, accused Tartaglia of prejudice, homophobia and ignorance and called for him to apologise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotland-to-allow-gay-marriage-as-bishop-accused-of-homophobia.1343214680|title=Scotland to allow gay marriage as bishop accused of homophobia | work= Herald Scotland|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Comments on sex abuse==\nIn August 2015, Tartaglia commented at a Mass:{{quote|The Catholic Bishops of Scotland are shamed and pained by what you have suffered.

His ecclesiastical studies were completed at the [[The Scots College (Rome)|Pontifical Scots College]], and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.\n\n==Priesthood==\nTartaglia was [[ordination|ordained]] [[priest]] by Archbishop [[Thomas Winning]] at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, [[Dennistoun]] on 30 June 1975. He then returned to Rome where he completed his ordinary course of studies in 1976 before beginning research for his doctorate in Sacred Theology. In 1978 he was additionally appointed as dean of studies at the Scots College in Rome, and was also acting vice-rector at that time.\n\nAfter obtaining his [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|STD]] degree in 1980, on the [[Council of Trent]]'s teaching on the [[Eucharist]], he was appointed assistant priest at Our Lady of Lourdes, [[Cardonald]], while at the same time becoming an extramural lecturer at St. Peter's College, [[Newlands, Glasgow|Newlands]], Glasgow.\n\nA year later, he was appointed lecturer at St. Peter's College, becoming director of studies in 1983. When Chesters College, [[Bearsden]], opened in 1985 he was made vice-rector. In 1987 he was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]].\n\nHe served as rector until 1993 when he was sent to St. Patrick's, [[Dumbarton]], as assistant priest before being appointed parish priest of St Mary's, [[Duntocher]] in 1995. In 2004 the [[Bishops' Conference of Scotland]] asked him to return to seminary as rector of the Pontifical Scots College, Rome.\n\n==Episcopate==\nOn 13 September 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] nominated Tartaglia as Bishop of Paisley.  On 20 November 2005 the [[Feast of Christ the King|Solemnity of Christ the King]], he was consecrated in [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] by [[Archbishop Mario Conti]]. The co-consecrating bishops were Archbishop [[Raymond Leo Burke]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|St Louis]], [[Missouri]] ([[United States]]) and Bishop [[John Mone]], Emeritus Bishop of Paisley.\n\nIn 2006 he attracted controversy for attacking UK law relating to the family. He outlined his opinion that the [[Family Law Act 1996]], which made [[divorce]] quicker and easier, [[civil partnership]] legislation giving homosexual relationships legal status, and the [[Gender Recognition Act]], allowing people to change their gender designation, undermined the family in society: \"Unfortunately, in our times, the minds of many have been so darkened by hubris and by the selfish pursuit of their own gratification that they have lost sight of the natural law which God has written into his creation...\".<ref>\"Bishop lays down the law to Labour\", p. 3, ''[[The Catholic Times (UK and Ireland)|The Catholic Times]]'', 15 October 2006.</ref> He reiterated this in 2010 when he wrote to [[David Cameron]] to insist that \"the Catholic Church will not register civil partnerships nor celebrate same-sex unions: not now, not in the future, not ever, no matter what legislation or regulations your government enacts or endorses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Writer |first=Staff |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/07/23/catholic-church-will-never-recognise-gay-marriage-bishop-tells-cameron |title=Catholic Church will \u2018never\u2019 recognise gay marriage, bishop tells Cameron |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> He also criticised the UK government's decision to upgrade its [[nuclear weapon]]s capability.\n\nIn 2008, as president of the National Communications Commission of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland, he wrote to every parish in Scotland decrying the media for pushing a \u201csecular and humanistic agenda\u201d. Arguing his belief that \"over two thirds\" of Scots are actually Christians, and that the proportion of people who work the media does not reflect this, leading to a \"fundamental disconnection between the provider and the consumer\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 2008 Tartaglia was mooted by some commentators as a possible successor to the [[Archdiocese of Westminster|see of Westminster]], albeit with an outside chance. In the event the new appointee was Archbishop [[Vincent Nichols]].<ref name=\"timesonline1\"/>\n\nOn 24 July 2012 the [[Holy See]] announced the appointment of Tartaglia as [[Archbishop of Glasgow]] to succeed Archbishop Mario Conti. He took possession of the diocese on 8 September 2012, the [[Nativity of Mary|Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\nOn 29 June 2013, Tartaglia received the [[pallium]] from [[Pope Francis]] at a Mass in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], on the liturgical [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul]].\n\n==Comments on homosexuality==\nIn April 2012 he participated in a conference on religious freedom and tolerance, held at [[Oxford University]]. In response to a point made by a member of the audience, Tartaglia raised the death of \"a gay Catholic MP who died at the age of 44\", a likely reference to [[David Cairns (politician)|David Cairns]], whose death from [[pancreatitis]] he claimed was potentially due to his sexuality. He went on to imply that the connection was being avoided, saying \"...nobody said anything...and why his body should just shut down at that age, obviously he could have had a disease which would have killed anyone, but you seem to hear so many stories about this kind of thing, but society won't address it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18980379 |title=BBC News - Archbishop Philip Tartaglia's gay MP remark 'adds to family's grief' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Cairns's partner Dermot Kehoe criticised him for making a claim for which was contradicted by the medical evidence, and for adding to the grief suffered by the family of the deceased, accused Tartaglia of prejudice, homophobia and ignorance and called for him to apologise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotland-to-allow-gay-marriage-as-bishop-accused-of-homophobia.1343214680|title=Scotland to allow gay marriage as bishop accused of homophobia | work= Herald Scotland|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Comments on sex abuse==\nIn August 2015, Tartaglia commented at a Mass:{{quote|The Catholic Bishops of Scotland are shamed and pained by what you have suffered.

Lance is one of two women under the alias [[Black Canary]] within the [[DC Universe]]; she is [[Black Canary (Dinah Drake)|Dinah Drake]]'s daughter and successor of the superhero mantle in the post-''Crisis'' narratives.  She is commonly affiliated with the  ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and the archer superhero [[Green Arrow]], professionally and romantically. She is also a common member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\nBlack Canary has been adapted into various media, including [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|direct-to-video animated films]], video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV Series)|Young Justice]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. In ''Birds of Prey'' she was played by [[Rachel Skarsten]], and in ''Smallville'' she was played by [[Alaina Huffman]]. In ''Arrow'' and the [[Arrowverse]] shows the character Dinah Laurel Lance is portrayed by [[Katie Cassidy]]. Dinah Lance made her cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'', portrayed by [[Jurnee Smollett-Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/birds-prey-is-called-fantabulous-emancipation-one-harley-quinn-1163151|title=Margot Robbie Reveals Full 'Birds of Prey' Title: 'The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn'|website=thehollywoodreporter|date=November 20, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122043959/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/birds-prey-is-called-fantabulous-emancipation-one-harley-quinn-1163151|archive-date=November 22, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Post-Crisis}}Fictional character biography==\nFollowing the universe-altering events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (concluding in March 1986), Black Canary's history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake Lance. Although some references (for example, those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series) tried to distinguish the two Canaries by calling the first \"Diana\", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name.\n\nThe two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in ''Secret Origins'' #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book|last= Beatty|first= Scott|author-link= Scott Beatty| contribution= Black Canary|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 50|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name \"Laurel\" from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= Manley, Mike; Hanna, Scott; Golden, Michael|story= Sensei & Student Part Five Murder & Mystery|title= [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]|issue= 66|date=June 2004}}</ref>).\n\nThe younger Dinah has her own \"canary cry\"\u2014in this version, the result of a [[metagene]] absent from both her parents\u2014which (unlike the Silver Age Black Canary) she can control.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Growing up surrounded by her mother's friends in the disbanded JSA (seeing them as uncles and aunts), she wishes to be a costumed hero like her mother, but the elder Dinah discourages her, feeling that the world has become too dangerous for her daughter to succeed. Regardless, Dinah finds fighters (including former JSA member [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]]) who help her hone her skills, and after years of dedication and training, she assumes the mantle of Black Canary despite her mother's opposition. Like her mother, Dinah operates out of Gotham, with a day job in the family floral business.\n\nIn an early ''Birds of Prey'' issue, writer [[Chuck Dixon]] has Dinah briefly married and divorced at a young age. Although ex-husband Craig Windrow seems to need her help, he actually wants to reconcile after he embezzles from the mob.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller= Giordano, Dick|inker= Faucher, Wayne|story= |title= Birds of Prey: Wolves|issue= 1|date= 1997}}</ref> Dinah's early marriage and ex-husband are not mentioned again until the 2007 ''Black Canary'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]].\n\nAfter joining the Justice League, Dinah meets Green Arrow (Oliver Queen). Although she dislikes him at first, they become romantically involved despite their age difference; opposite the earlier depiction, in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] stories Oliver is considerably older than Dinah. Dinah is a League member for about six years, including a brief stint with [[Justice League International]] (JLI, which she helps found). After her mother's death from radiation poisoning received during her battle with Aquarius, Dinah feels that her time in the JLA is over. She moves to Seattle with Green Arrow and opens a flower shop, Sherwood Florist.\n\nWhen Dinah belonged to the JLI during the 1980s she wore a new costume, a blue-and-black full-body jumpsuit with a bird motif and a slightly looser fit instead of her traditional, skin-tight black outfit with fishnet stockings. The change was poorly received and short-lived, and later artists restored her original look.<ref name=\"Kingman\" >{{cite journal|last = Kingman|first = Jim|title = The Ballad of Ollie and Dinah|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 10\u201321|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = May 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n===''Birds of Prey''===\n{{main|Birds of Prey (team)}}\nWhen former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]] is [[Batman: The Killing Joke|seriously injured]] by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], she reestablishes her crime-fighting career as Oracle, information broker to the superhero community.

Her relationship with Oracle is rocky at first, since her impulsiveness clashes with Oracle's organization. Gradually, they learn to work together and became friends.

In a  Week 51 back-up feature of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Black Canary is at the battle which forms the League. Its core is Black Canary, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman. In the 2007 ''Black Canary'' miniseries, she and Green Arrow join the Justice League after its founding and are tested by founding member Batman early in their membership.\n\nDuring publication of the ''Infinite Crisis'' limited series, most [[DC Universe]] comic books advanced one year. After this \"[[One Year Later]]\" jump, Dinah trades life experiences with [[Lady Shiva]] to soften the warrior and begins a harsh training regimen in an unidentified Vietnamese [[shanty town]]. The regimen replicates Shiva's early life and training, and Shiva assumes Dinah's role in Oracle's group.\n\nDuring ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', several series include tie-ins and run-ups to the wedding of Dinah and Ollie.<ref>Cowsill, Alan \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 331: \"Two of DC's best-loved characters were married in the ''Green Arrow and Black Canary Wedding Special'' - or so it seemed.\"</ref> ''The Black Canary Wedding Planner'' details the preparations; in ''Birds of Prey'' #109, Dinah and Barbara discuss the wedding (and Ollie). ''Countdown: Justice League Wedding Special'', and ''Justice League'' #13 deal with the bachelor and bachelorette parties. A plot thread throughout is a plan by the [[Injustice League]] to attack the wedding.\n\nDinah resigns as JLA chairwoman after the team's confrontation with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]].

The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in ''Green Arrow Rebirth'' #1, and instantly hit it off. In the ensuing ''Green Arrow'' series, Dinah is the first to notice something awry with Oliver's apparent suicide (in fact, an attempted assassination by [[Shado (comics)|Shado]]) and disappearance. She is also a current member of the Birds of Prey, as well as the Justice League of America. In ''Birds of Prey: Rebirth'', it is revealed that Dinah and Barbara ([[Batgirl]]) have been good friends for a few years now, while just meeting [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]] ([[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]).

Although some references (for example, those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series) tried to distinguish the two Canaries by calling the first \"Diana\", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name.\n\nThe two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in ''Secret Origins'' #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force.

Its core is Black Canary, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman. In the 2007 ''Black Canary'' miniseries, she and Green Arrow join the Justice League after its founding and are tested by founding member Batman early in their membership.\n\nDuring publication of the ''Infinite Crisis'' limited series, most [[DC Universe]] comic books advanced one year.

The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in ''Green Arrow Rebirth'' #1, and instantly hit it off. In the ensuing ''Green Arrow'' series, Dinah is the first to notice something awry with Oliver's apparent suicide (in fact, an attempted assassination by [[Shado (comics)|Shado]]) and disappearance. She is also a current member of the Birds of Prey, as well as the Justice League of America. In ''Birds of Prey: Rebirth'', it is revealed that Dinah and Barbara ([[Batgirl]]) have been good friends for a few years now, while just meeting [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]] ([[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). In ''Justice League of America'', she is seen fighting Caitlin Snow ([[Killer Frost]]), and is later recruited by [[Batman]] due to the skills she possesses.\n\n=={{anchor|Powers, abilities, and equipment}}Powers, abilities and equipment==\nAlthough depictions of Black Canary have varied over the years, she is often portrayed as a prodigious hand-to-hand combatant, having mastered styles such as [[Aikido]],<ref>''Black Canary'' vol. 3 #2 (September 2007)</ref> [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Hapkido]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Green Arrow'' vol. 2 Annual #1 (September 1988)</ref><ref>''Batman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (October 1997)</ref><ref name=\"BlackCanaryMartialArts\">''Birds of Prey'' vol. 1 #58 (October 2003)</ref> [[Jujutsu]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Okinawan martial arts|Shuri-te]],<ref name=BlackCanaryMartialArts /> and [[Wing Chun]].<ref>''JSA'' #14 (September 2000)</ref> She has been trained by other top-tier fighters, such as [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Lady Shiva]], [[Cassandra Cain]], and [[Wonder Woman]], as well as having bested [[Batman]], from time to time, in hand-to-hand combat.  In addition to her martial arts skills, Black Canary has been depicted as an expert motorcyclist, gymnast, covert operative and investigator.

Later, the cry is depicted as an inborn [[metahuman]] ability.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.

Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992\u201393.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39\u201348</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994\u201395.]]\nThe club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993\u201398)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team were  an amateur outfit who first played here in 1861.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I.

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15\u201319</ref>\n\nThe opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], with Palace losing 0\u20131 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club.

Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]].
