It aired on October 26, 2017 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. The episode was written by Jalysa Conway and directed by [[Cecilie Mosli]]; Conway, an Air Force veteran, found inspiration in her own experiences to conceive the episode. \"Danger Zone\" takes place during two time lapses: the present time, in Seattle, where [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) deals with the decision his sister, Megan Hunt ([[Abigail Spencer]]) has made with former fianc\u00e9e [[Nathan Riggs]] ([[Martin Henderson]]), to move in to [[Malibu, California]] with Megan's adopted son from [[Iraq]], Farouk; and in Iraq during 2007, where Megan, Riggs, Owen and his best friend [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) were stationed, explaining the backstory of Megan's kidnapping and Riggs' proposal to her.\n\n\"Danger Zone\" was designed as the departure for series regular [[Martin Henderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/greys-anatomy-season-14-martin-henderson-1202600103/|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 14 Sees Another Series Regular Depart|first=Danielle|last=Turchiano|date=27 October 2017|website=Variety|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> having joined the cast in 2015 and conceived originally as the love interest for [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) following the death of her husband, [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]).\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 7.67 million viewers. It received moderately positive reception from critics and fans, praising Spencer's performance, as well Mosli's direction and Conway's writing, but being less receptive into Martin Henderson's abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Iraq in 2007, Megan is waiting to hear back on stratification rankings. She needs to be number one to realise her dream of becoming flight surgeon. As she goes to wake up Nathan, she finds a necklace under a pile of clothes. He claims he intended to propose to her and chose for a necklace rather than a ring since she loses everything that is not attached to her. She accepts and shares the news with Teddy and Owen, but her happiness is quickly crushed when it is announced that she is not number one in the ranking. Megan thinks that Owen, her Commanding Officer, has recommended her, while he actually did the opposite in an attempt to protect her from the dangerous position. As multiple wounded soldiers come in after two of their Iraqi allies went rogue, the siblings end up operating on the same patient and Megan discovers the truth. Meanwhile, Teddy and Nathan operate together. Teddy knows Nathan cheated on Megan because she recognised the necklace as belonging to a woman named Felicia. He admits to cheating and she convinces him to tell Megan the truth since he really does want to marry her. This leads to a heated confrontation between the two, which is interrupted when Megan has to tend to Sana, one of her patients. When Megan tells Owen about Nathan cheating, he tells her to get away from Nathan and board the next evacuation helicopter with the patient, which is against protocol. At the same time, Teddy's patient informs her that the second shooter was actually an Iraqi woman, whom the Army doctors were previously told tried to wrestle the gun out of a man's hands. Teddy connects the dots but she's seconds too late to warn Megan, and can only watch the helicopter fly away. Distraught over both her brother's and Nathan's betrayal, Megan is distracted and does not notice Sana reaching for a gun, which would lead to Megan being kidnapped.\n\nIn the present, Owen decides to drive with Megan to her new house in Malibu, which Nathan and Farouk are preparing as they await her arrival. On the road, they happily reminisce about their past but end up fighting over the fact that Owen caused her to lose out on the flight surgeon training. They eventually have a heart-to-heart when he confesses he'd rather have her stay in Seattle with him. She makes it clear it is not his job to protect her anymore, and that she has no reason to hate Nathan for cheating on her as, unbeknownst to Owen, she had cheated on him first. She confides that all those years in captivity have taught her that every little bit of happiness is worth clinging to, regardless of what everyone else thinks. In captivity, she decided she wanted to live on the beach to experience freedom. She also offers Owen some words of wisdom by pointing out that he is very loyal to his ideas and ideals, but that in order to be happy, he might have to break up with some of those ideals. Meanwhile, Nathan and Meredith have their final conversation through texts, in which they thank one another for what they have meant in each other's lives. Megan then joins Nathan and Farouk at their new home. As one happy family, they spend time on the beach.\n\nOwen returns home to Amelia and announces that he has decided they need to separate to be happy again, something she has come to realise as well. They return their rings and hug.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MartinhEN.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Abigail Spencer 2013 2.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Martin Henderson]] (''left'') and [[Abigail Spencer]] (''right'') made their final appearances in \"Danger Zone\" as Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt.\n}}\nThe episode marked the final appearances of Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt. It also marks Kim Raver's completed return guest arc. [[Shonda Rhimes]] announced the exit of Martin Henderson as Nathan Riggs via Twitter. She said, \"I loved that we were able to give Riggs a happy ending worthy of his character and talent. As for Martin, this is not an ending for our relationship. He has been  part of the Shondaland family since the pilot of Inside the Box and he will always be family. I can\u2019t wait to find a new project to work with him on in the future.\" Henderson indicated in an interview with ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' that his departure was a storytelling based decision, as he was given a \"short-term contract\", adding, \"This [was] my final year so I was expecting Nathan\u2019s storyline to be wrapped up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/26/martin-henderson-leaves-greys-anatomy-nathan-season-14/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: [Spoiler] Exits|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=27 October 2017|publisher=tvline.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHenderson shared his thoughts on his relationships with both Megan and Meredith\n<blockquote>\nI think there was clearly something for Nathan in those relationships. Feelings like that, I don\u2019t think they go away. The nature of his previous commitment to Megan and his feelings around that put him in a horrible state of having to choose between two people he cares about, but honoring his commitment to Megan and following through on that is the right thing to do. It doesn\u2019t negate his feelings for Meredith. The complications of Meredith\u2019s emotions, the loss of Derek and moving on from that still plagues her. And there\u2019s as much ambiguity around all those feelings. The two of them found each other and that provided good drama. I feel bad for fans who were keen on Meredith and Nathan making it, and not being privy to where each character would go. It\u2019s hard to hear those outpourings from those who didn\u2019t know it was going to end up like this. But it makes for nice drama and it\u2019s something that Shonda does brilliantly: Dashing people\u2019s hopes and expectations. That\u2019s why the show continues to be successful. You can\u2019t predict what will happen to people at any time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/greys-anatomy-martin-henderson-leaving-interview-shonda-rhimes-1202194978/|title=Departing \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Series Regular & Shonda Rhimes On Surprise Doctor Exit|first=Nellie Andreeva,Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=27 October 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn Owen's decision to break up with [[Amelia Shepherd]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) for good after the successful removal of her tumor, McKidd said, \"There\u2019s always a chance with every relationship for reconciliation. Even though it seems, by the end of this episode, that this is what\u2019s to happen with Owen and Amelia, they have a lot of history and there\u2019s a lot of love there. So they are going to try to be friends. That\u2019s their commitment right now.

It aired on October 26, 2017 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. The episode was written by Jalysa Conway and directed by [[Cecilie Mosli]]; Conway, an Air Force veteran, found inspiration in her own experiences to conceive the episode. \"Danger Zone\" takes place during two time lapses: the present time, in Seattle, where [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) deals with the decision his sister, Megan Hunt ([[Abigail Spencer]]) has made with former fianc\u00e9e [[Nathan Riggs]] ([[Martin Henderson]]), to move in to [[Malibu, California]] with Megan's adopted son from [[Iraq]], Farouk; and in Iraq during 2007, where Megan, Riggs, Owen and his best friend [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) were stationed, explaining the backstory of Megan's kidnapping and Riggs' proposal to her.\n\n\"Danger Zone\" was designed as the departure for series regular [[Martin Henderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/greys-anatomy-season-14-martin-henderson-1202600103/|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 14 Sees Another Series Regular Depart|first=Danielle|last=Turchiano|date=27 October 2017|website=Variety|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> having joined the cast in 2015 and conceived originally as the love interest for [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) following the death of her husband, [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]).\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 7.67 million viewers. It received moderately positive reception from critics and fans, praising Spencer's performance, as well Mosli's direction and Conway's writing, but being less receptive into Martin Henderson's abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Iraq in 2007, Megan is waiting to hear back on stratification rankings. She needs to be number one to realise her dream of becoming flight surgeon. As she goes to wake up Nathan, she finds a necklace under a pile of clothes. He claims he intended to propose to her and chose for a necklace rather than a ring since she loses everything that is not attached to her. She accepts and shares the news with Teddy and Owen, but her happiness is quickly crushed when it is announced that she is not number one in the ranking. Megan thinks that Owen, her Commanding Officer, has recommended her, while he actually did the opposite in an attempt to protect her from the dangerous position. As multiple wounded soldiers come in after two of their Iraqi allies went rogue, the siblings end up operating on the same patient and Megan discovers the truth. Meanwhile, Teddy and Nathan operate together. Teddy knows Nathan cheated on Megan because she recognised the necklace as belonging to a woman named Felicia. He admits to cheating and she convinces him to tell Megan the truth since he really does want to marry her. This leads to a heated confrontation between the two, which is interrupted when Megan has to tend to Sana, one of her patients. When Megan tells Owen about Nathan cheating, he tells her to get away from Nathan and board the next evacuation helicopter with the patient, which is against protocol. At the same time, Teddy's patient informs her that the second shooter was actually an Iraqi woman, whom the Army doctors were previously told tried to wrestle the gun out of a man's hands. Teddy connects the dots but she's seconds too late to warn Megan, and can only watch the helicopter fly away. Distraught over both her brother's and Nathan's betrayal, Megan is distracted and does not notice Sana reaching for a gun, which would lead to Megan being kidnapped.\n\nIn the present, Owen decides to drive with Megan to her new house in Malibu, which Nathan and Farouk are preparing as they await her arrival. On the road, they happily reminisce about their past but end up fighting over the fact that Owen caused her to lose out on the flight surgeon training. They eventually have a heart-to-heart when he confesses he'd rather have her stay in Seattle with him. She makes it clear it is not his job to protect her anymore, and that she has no reason to hate Nathan for cheating on her as, unbeknownst to Owen, she had cheated on him first. She confides that all those years in captivity have taught her that every little bit of happiness is worth clinging to, regardless of what everyone else thinks. In captivity, she decided she wanted to live on the beach to experience freedom. She also offers Owen some words of wisdom by pointing out that he is very loyal to his ideas and ideals, but that in order to be happy, he might have to break up with some of those ideals. Meanwhile, Nathan and Meredith have their final conversation through texts, in which they thank one another for what they have meant in each other's lives. Megan then joins Nathan and Farouk at their new home. As one happy family, they spend time on the beach.\n\nOwen returns home to Amelia and announces that he has decided they need to separate to be happy again, something she has come to realise as well. They return their rings and hug.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MartinhEN.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Abigail Spencer 2013 2.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Martin Henderson]] (''left'') and [[Abigail Spencer]] (''right'') made their final appearances in \"Danger Zone\" as Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt.\n}}\nThe episode marked the final appearances of Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt. It also marks Kim Raver's completed return guest arc. [[Shonda Rhimes]] announced the exit of Martin Henderson as Nathan Riggs via Twitter. She said, \"I loved that we were able to give Riggs a happy ending worthy of his character and talent. As for Martin, this is not an ending for our relationship. He has been  part of the Shondaland family since the pilot of Inside the Box and he will always be family. I can\u2019t wait to find a new project to work with him on in the future.\" Henderson indicated in an interview with ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' that his departure was a storytelling based decision, as he was given a \"short-term contract\", adding, \"This [was] my final year so I was expecting Nathan\u2019s storyline to be wrapped up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/26/martin-henderson-leaves-greys-anatomy-nathan-season-14/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: [Spoiler] Exits|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=27 October 2017|publisher=tvline.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHenderson shared his thoughts on his relationships with both Megan and Meredith\n<blockquote>\nI think there was clearly something for Nathan in those relationships. Feelings like that, I don\u2019t think they go away. The nature of his previous commitment to Megan and his feelings around that put him in a horrible state of having to choose between two people he cares about, but honoring his commitment to Megan and following through on that is the right thing to do. It doesn\u2019t negate his feelings for Meredith. The complications of Meredith\u2019s emotions, the loss of Derek and moving on from that still plagues her. And there\u2019s as much ambiguity around all those feelings. The two of them found each other and that provided good drama. I feel bad for fans who were keen on Meredith and Nathan making it, and not being privy to where each character would go. It\u2019s hard to hear those outpourings from those who didn\u2019t know it was going to end up like this. But it makes for nice drama and it\u2019s something that Shonda does brilliantly: Dashing people\u2019s hopes and expectations. That\u2019s why the show continues to be successful. You can\u2019t predict what will happen to people at any time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/greys-anatomy-martin-henderson-leaving-interview-shonda-rhimes-1202194978/|title=Departing \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Series Regular & Shonda Rhimes On Surprise Doctor Exit|first=Nellie Andreeva,Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=27 October 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn Owen's decision to break up with [[Amelia Shepherd]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) for good after the successful removal of her tumor, McKidd said, \"There\u2019s always a chance with every relationship for reconciliation.

Also, people found in possession of marked goods provide the police with solid evidence of criminal activity. Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Unique Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a uniform equipment control system (UECS) able to generate unique identification numbers (UIN) for storage and retrieval on a uniform identification system (UIS). The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience fewer burglaries than their neighbors.

Also, people found in possession of marked goods provide the police with solid evidence of criminal activity. Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Unique Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a uniform equipment control system (UECS) able to generat unique identification numbers (UIN) for storage and retrieval on a uniform identification system (UIS).

The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] platform at one time referencing \"the twin relics of barbarism\u2014polygamy and slavery.\"<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm US History.org] website</ref> The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], [[Orson Pratt]],<ref name=Embry1994 /> by the request of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]].\n\nFor over 60 years, the [[LDS Church and politics in the United States|LDS Church and the United States]] were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the [[Utah War]] of 1857 and 1858, given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.<ref name=Embry1994 /> In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In 1879, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'',<ref>''Reynolds v.

After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before Congress and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, and established [[excommunication]] as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small \"fundamentalist\" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB) and the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church).

On July 8, 1862, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] into law, which forbade the practice in U.S. territories. Lincoln made a statement that he had no intentions of enforcing it if the LDS Church would not interfere with him, and so the matter was laid to rest for a time. But rhetoric continued, and polygamy became an impediment to Utah being admitted as a state. Brigham Young preached in 1866 that if Utah will not be admitted to the Union until it abandons polygamy, \"we shall never be admitted.\"<ref>''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''11''':266.</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, immigrants to Utah who were not members of the church continued the contest for political power. They were frustrated by the consolidation of the members. Forming the [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]], non-Mormons began pushing for political changes and sought to weaken the church's dominance in the territory. In September 1871, Young was indicted for adultery due to his plural marriages. On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''.\n\n===1882 Edmunds Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds Act}}\nIn February 1882, [[George Q. Cannon]], a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the [[Edmunds Act]] was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. \"Unlawful cohabitation\", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment.<ref name=Embry1994 /> It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, [[Rudger Clawson]] was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.\n\n===1887 Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act}}\n[[File:Polygamists in prison.jpg|thumb|290px|Portrait of polygamists in prison, at the Utah Penitentiary, including [[George Q. Cannon]] in 1889, arrested under the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act.]]\nIn 1887, the [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.\n\nThe church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate \"underground\".\n\nFollowing the passage of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting  priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], \"stopping all the ordinances therein,\" and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed:\n\n{{quote|I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 1|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>}}\n\n==1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage==\n{{Main|1890 Manifesto}}\nThe final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the [[general authorities]] that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by [[George Q. Cannon]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] and unanimously approved.\n\nWhile many church leaders in 1890 regarded the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/sfeature/utah_04.html|title=The Mormons \u2013 Special Features \u2013 PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hardy|1992}}</ref>\n\n===1904 Second Manifesto===\n{{Main|Second Manifesto}}\nIt was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]], that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide.<ref>Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159.</ref> Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the [[Reed Smoot hearings|Smoot hearings]] made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.\n\nThe ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]]. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]], who both resigned from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]]. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.\n\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=The History of Polygamy|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-history-polygamy-2|website=heritage.utah.gov|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|year=1994|quote=Those involved in plural marriages after 1904 were excommunicated; and those married between 1890 and 1904 were not to have church callings where other members would have to sustain them.

Lyman]] was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the [[law of chastity]].\n\n==Remnants within sects==\n[[Image:Teens from polygamous families.jpg|200px|thumb|Teens from polygamous families along with over 200 supporters demonstrate at a pro-plural marriage rally in Salt Lake City in 2006<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=Teens defend polygamy at Utah rally\n|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902171217/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|last=Dobner\n|first=Jennifer\n|agency=[[Associated Press]]\n|date=20 August 2006\n|work=[[Yahoo!

These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of \"exaltation\" through mere ''belief'' in polygamy).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1985|pp=24 fn. 65}}</ref>\n\nFor public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormon-fundamentalists- \"Mormon Fundamentalists\"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term \"Mormon\",<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/polygamist-sects-are-not--mormons,--church-says \"Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says\"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> journalists generally have not complied, and \"Mormon fundamentalist\" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]\" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the [[Book of Mormon]] and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.\n\n==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==\n{{Main|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's [[sacred text]]s and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through [[Mormonism and polygamy#Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died|vicarious sealing]] if they are also deceased.<ref>[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) \u00a7 3.6.1.</ref>\n\n===Reasons for polygamy===\nAs early as the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The [[Book of Jacob]] condemned polygamy as adultery,<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|23|29}}.</ref> but left open the proviso that \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things.\"<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|30}}.</ref> Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the [[1890 Manifesto]] and [[Second Manifesto]] rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.\n\nHowever, [[Bruce R. McConkie]] controversially stated in his 1958 book, ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', that God will \"obviously\" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.<ref>Bruce R. McConkie, ''Mormon Doctrine'', 2d ed., Bookcraft, 1966, p. 578 (\"Obviously the holy practice [of plural marriage] will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium.\"). See also Janet Bennion, ''Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q90cUKnsFEMC&pg=PA20 online at google books]: \"Ironically, many mainstream Mormons still believe plural marriage to be a law of the highest degree of heaven, simply in suspension until the millennium.\"</ref> This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium.<ref>John Cairncross, ''After polygamy was made a sin: the social history of Christian polygamy'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7730-0}}, p. 181.</ref> Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage.\n\n====Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died====\nIn the case where a man's first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives.<ref>[[Charles W. Penrose]], ''\"Mormon\" Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life'', 1897, Salt Lake City, p.66 (\"In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory.\"); [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [[Bruce R. McConkie]], ed., ''Doctrines of Salvation'', 1956, vol. 2, p. 67 (Smith, who was sealed to two different women, stated, \"[M]y wives will be mine in the eternity.\"); [[Harold B. Lee]], ''Deseret News 1974 Church Almanac'', p. 17 (\"My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan joins Fern/That three might be, more fitted for eternity./'O Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee'.\").</ref> Apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] is an example of such a case.<ref>\"When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side.\" [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/10/timing?lang=eng \"Timing\"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 2003.</ref>\n\nUnder LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple \"for time only\", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.\n\nAs of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died.<ref name = CHOI>LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998) p. 72. \"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\"</ref> Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012|talk=y}}\nA man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a \"sealing clearance\" from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a \"cancellation of sealing\" (sometimes called a \"temple divorce\"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.\n\n====Proxy sealings where both spouses have died====\nAccording to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.<ref name = CHOI/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.familysearch.org/kb/UserGuide/en/policy/r_wws_policy_sealing_to_spouse_multiple_husbands.html|title=Help Center \u2014 FamilySearch.org|website=help.familysearch.org}}</ref>\n\nChurch doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:\n# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.\n# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.\n\n==Criticism of plural marriage==\n\n===Instances of unhappy plural marriage===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=226\u2013228}}</ref> LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book ''[[In Sacred Loneliness]]'', described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Compton|1997\">{{Harvnb|Compton|1997}}</ref>\n\n===A means for male sexual gratification===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=204\u2013290}}</ref>  Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|p=202}}</ref> Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1876|pp=65\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1842|pp=226\u2013232}}</ref> Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, [[Fanny Alger]], by taking Alger as his second wife.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=132\u2013134}}</ref> Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair.<ref>{{Harvnb|Compton|1996|pp=174\u2013207}}</ref> However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as \"debatable supposition\" rather than \"established fact\".<ref>[http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm \"Review of Todd Compton, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 33 (Spring 2001): 184\u201386</ref>\n\nOthers conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor [[Heber C. Kimball]], expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that \"I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time.\"<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]], ''[[Brigham Young: American Moses]]'', p. 100 (1985).</ref> When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate. He was later shocked to learn that he was to marry a younger woman.<ref name=\"Whitney 1888 p=326\">{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|p=326}}</ref> His biographer writes that he \"became sick in body, but his mental wretchedness was too great to allow of his retiring, and he would walk the floor till nearly morning, and sometimes the agony of his mind was so terrible that he would wring his hands and weep like a child\".<ref name=\"Whitney 1888 p=326\"/> While his wife Vilate had trials \"grievous to bear\" as a result of her acceptance of plural marriage, she supported her husband in his religious duties, and taught her children that \"she could not doubt the plural order of marriage was of God, for the Lord had revealed it to her in answer to prayer.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|pp=325\u2013328}}</ref>\n\n===Underage plural marriages===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=294}}</ref> Historian [[George D.

In 1857, he stated, \"I shall not seal the people as I have done. Old Father Alread brought three young girls 12 & 13 years old. I would not seal them to him.

Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gage|1972}}</ref> [[Ann Eliza Young]], nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=440\u2013454}}</ref>\n\n===Incestuous plural marriages===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral.<ref name=\"Abanes 2003 pp=297\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=306\u2013319}}</ref> In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the sealing of [[John Milton Bernhisel]] to his sister, Maria, in a ceremony that included the sealing of Bernhisel to multiple relatives, some of whom were deceased.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faulring|1987|p=424}}</ref> However, this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between Bernhisel and his sister.

The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] platform at one time referencing \"the twin relics of barbarism\u2014polygamy and slavery.\"<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm US History.org] website</ref> The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], [[Orson Pratt]],<ref name=Embry1994 /> by the request of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]].\n\nFor over 60 years, the [[LDS Church and politics in the United States|LDS Church and the United States]] were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the [[Utah War]] of 1857 and 1858, given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.<ref name=Embry1994 /> In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In 1879, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'',<ref>''Reynolds v. United States'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009192447/http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/scripts/supremecourt/glossary.cgi?term=r&letter=yes \u201cThe History of The Supreme Court\u201d]</ref> the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: \"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.\"<ref name=Embry1994 />\n\nIn 1890, when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still the practice, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially terminated the practice of polygamy.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration |od|1}}</ref> Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before Congress and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease and established [[excommunication]] as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small \"fundamentalist\" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB) and the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice.<ref>The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word \"Mormon\" in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy {{cite web |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide \u2014 LDS Newsroom |accessdate=2014-04-15}}; the church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25396937 |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> On its web site, the church states that \"the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy\" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.<ref name=LDSofficialstatement /><ref>Citing [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]], chapter 2, from the [[Book of Mormon]]: \"Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none . ...

On July 8, 1862, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] into law, which forbade the practice in U.S. territories. Lincoln made a statement that he had no intentions of enforcing it if the LDS Church would not interfere with him, and so the matter was laid to rest for a time. But rhetoric continued, and polygamy became an impediment to Utah being admitted as a state. Brigham Young preached in 1866 that if Utah will not be admitted to the Union until it abandons polygamy, \"we shall never be admitted.\"<ref>''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''11''':266.</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, immigrants to Utah who were not members of the church continued the contest for political power. They were frustrated by the consolidation of the members. Forming the [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]], non-Mormons began pushing for political changes and sought to weaken the church's dominance in the territory. In September 1871, Young was indicted for adultery due to his plural marriages. On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''.\n\n===1882 Edmunds Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds Act}}\nIn February 1882, [[George Q. Cannon]], a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the [[Edmunds Act]] was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. \"Unlawful cohabitation\", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment.<ref name=Embry1994 /> It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, [[Rudger Clawson]] was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.\n\n===1887 Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act}}\n[[File:Polygamists in prison.jpg|thumb|290px|Portrait of polygamists in prison, at the Utah Penitentiary, including [[George Q. Cannon]] in 1889, arrested under the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act.]]\nIn 1887, the [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.\n\nThe church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate \"underground\".\n\nFollowing the passage of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting  priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], \"stopping all the ordinances therein,\" and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed:\n\n{{quote|I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 1|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>}}\n\n==1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage==\n{{Main|1890 Manifesto}}\nThe final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the [[general authorities]] that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by [[George Q. Cannon]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] and unanimously approved.\n\nWhile many church leaders in 1890 regarded the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/sfeature/utah_04.html|title=The Mormons \u2013 Special Features \u2013 PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hardy|1992}}</ref>\n\n===1904 Second Manifesto===\n{{Main|Second Manifesto}}\nIt was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]], that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide.<ref>Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159.</ref> Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the [[Reed Smoot hearings|Smoot hearings]] made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.\n\nThe ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]]. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W.

Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73.

These groups continue to practice \"the Principle\". In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle [[Mark E. Petersen]] coined the term \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]]\" to describe such people.<ref>Ken Driggs, \"'This Will Someday Be the Head and Not the Tail of the Church': A History of the Mormon Fundamentalists at Short Creek\", ''[[Journal of Church and State]]'' '''43''':49 (2001) at p. 51.</ref> Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term \"Mormon fundamentalists\" and suggests using the term \"polygamist sects\" to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy.<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/controversies.html|title=The Mormons .

These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of \"exaltation\" through mere ''belief'' in polygamy).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1985|pp=24 fn. 65}}</ref>\n\nFor public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormon-fundamentalists- \"Mormon Fundamentalists\"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term \"Mormon\",<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/polygamist-sects-are-not--mormons,--church-says \"Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says\"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> journalists generally have not complied, and \"Mormon fundamentalist\" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]\" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the [[Book of Mormon]] and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.\n\n==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==\n{{Main|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's [[sacred text]]s and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through [[Mormonism and polygamy#Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died|vicarious sealing]] if they are also deceased.<ref>[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) \u00a7 3.6.1.</ref>\n\n===Reasons for polygamy===\nAs early as the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The [[Book of Jacob]] condemned polygamy as adultery,<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|23|29}}.</ref> but left open the proviso that \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things.\"<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|30}}.</ref> Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the [[1890 Manifesto]] and [[Second Manifesto]] rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.\n\nHowever, [[Bruce R. McConkie]] controversially stated in his 1958 book, ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', that God will \"obviously\" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.<ref>Bruce R. McConkie, ''Mormon Doctrine'', 2d ed., Bookcraft, 1966, p. 578 (\"Obviously the holy practice [of plural marriage] will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium.\"). See also Janet Bennion, ''Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q90cUKnsFEMC&pg=PA20 online at google books]: \"Ironically, many mainstream Mormons still believe plural marriage to be a law of the highest degree of heaven, simply in suspension until the millennium.\"</ref> This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium.<ref>John Cairncross, ''After polygamy was made a sin: the social history of Christian polygamy'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7730-0}}, p. 181.</ref> Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage.\n\n====Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died====\nIn the case where a man's first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives.<ref>[[Charles W. Penrose]], ''\"Mormon\" Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life'', 1897, Salt Lake City, p.66 (\"In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory.\"); [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [[Bruce R.

Lee]], ''Deseret News 1974 Church Almanac'', p. 17 (\"My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan joins Fern/That three might be, more fitted for eternity./'O Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee'.\").</ref> Apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] is an example of such a case.<ref>\"When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side.\" [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/10/timing?lang=eng \"Timing\"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 2003.</ref>\n\nUnder LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple \"for time only\", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.\n\nAs of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died.<ref name = CHOI>LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998) p. 72. \"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\"</ref> Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012|talk=y}}\nA man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a \"sealing clearance\" from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a \"cancellation of sealing\" (sometimes called a \"temple divorce\"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.\n\n====Proxy sealings where both spouses have died====\nAccording to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.<ref name = CHOI/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.familysearch.org/kb/UserGuide/en/policy/r_wws_policy_sealing_to_spouse_multiple_husbands.html|title=Help Center \u2014 FamilySearch.org|website=help.familysearch.org}}</ref>\n\nChurch doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:\n# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.\n# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.\n\n==Criticism of plural marriage==\n\n===Instances of unhappy plural marriage===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=226\u2013228}}</ref> LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book ''[[In Sacred Loneliness]]'', described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Compton|1997\">{{Harvnb|Compton|1997}}</ref>\n\n===A means for male sexual gratification===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=204\u2013290}}</ref>  Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|p=202}}</ref> Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1876|pp=65\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1842|pp=226\u2013232}}</ref> Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, [[Fanny Alger]], by taking Alger as his second wife.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=132\u2013134}}</ref> Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair.<ref>{{Harvnb|Compton|1996|pp=174\u2013207}}</ref> However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as \"debatable supposition\" rather than \"established fact\".<ref>[http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm \"Review of Todd Compton, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 33 (Spring 2001): 184\u201386</ref>\n\nOthers conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor [[Heber C. Kimball]], expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that \"I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time.\"<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]], ''[[Brigham Young: American Moses]]'', p. 100 (1985).</ref> When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate.

The dynasty was founded by [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah of Iran]].\n\nThe Pahlavis came to power after [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler of Iran, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The Iranian parliament, known as the ''[[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]'', convening as a [[Constituent Assembly]] on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (''[[Shah]]'') of Imperial State of [[Name of Iran|Persia]]. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] asked foreign delegates to use the [[endonym]] [[Name of Iran|Iran]] in formal correspondence and the official name the Imperial State of Iran was adopted.\n\nFollowing the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in 1953 supported by United Kingdom and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the [[Iranian Revolution|end]] of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922151735/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |archivedate=22 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] ethnicity.

In 1935, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that \"[[Persia]]\" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called \"Iran\" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.\n\nReza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the [[Soviet Union]]. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in [[World War II]]. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a [[neutral country]], but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to [[sabotage]] British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.\n\n==World War II==\n{{History of Iran}}\n{{Main|Invasion of Iran (1941)}}\nOn 13 September 1943 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946.<ref name=Jessup>{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945\u20131985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}</ref> At the time, the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]], a [[communist party]] that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in [[Tehran]] were occupied and the [[Isfahan]] branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan]] had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party.<ref name=\"Jessup\" /><ref>''The Iranian Crisis of 1945\u20131946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict'', by Fred H.

His wife was crowned as the [[Shahbanu]] of Iran.]]\n[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].\n\nIn 1951, the ''Majlis'' (the [[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] as new prime minister by a vote of 79\u201312, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see [[Abadan Crisis]]). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see [[Operation Ajax]]). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.\n\nMajor plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.\n\n==Collapse of the dynasty==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}\n[[File:Shah and Farah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and his wife left Iran on 16 January 1979.]]\n[[File:ShahVaRohanioon1.jpg|thumb|The last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] meets clergy. Some of Iranian clergy opposed him while some others supported him as \"The only Shi'ite ruler\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\n\nThe Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, [[SAVAK]]. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the \"[[White Revolution]]\". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]]. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the [[SAVAMA]]. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. [[Hossein Fardoust]], who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.\n\nMohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in [[Egypt]], Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of [[Anwar Sadat]].

Although the country was referred to as Persia by westerners, and the dominant language in court and administration was [[Persian language|Persian]] the dichotomy between pure Persian and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] elements had remained obvious until 1925.<!--Leave this redirect for now, as it may be more correct to refer to [[Western Persian]]--> The Pahlavi rule was instrumental in Iran's nationalisation in line with Persian culture and language which, amongst other ways, was achieved through the official ban on the use minority languages such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and successful suppression of separatist movements. [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]] is credited for [[Sheikh Khazal rebellion|reunification of Iran]] under a powerful central government. The use of minority languages in schools and newspapers was not tolerated. The succeeding regime&nbsp;\u2013 [[the Islamic Republic of Iran]]&nbsp;\u2013 has adopted a more inclusive approach in relation to the use of ethnic minorities and their language, however the issues as to [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], the Iran's largest ethnic minority, remain and pose considerable challenges for the unity and territorial integrity of [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tohidi|first=Nayereh|title=Iran: regionalism, ethnicity and democracy|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-irandemocracy/regionalism_3695.jsp|access-date=1 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714195518/http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-irandemocracy/regionalism_3695.jsp|archive-date=14 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==Pahlavi Shahs of Iran==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Name !!

The succession order of the [[List of monarchs of Persia|Persian throne]] in [[Iranian Revolution|1979]] was: (If Mohammad Reza Shah were to die or abdicate, \"[[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|number 1]]\" would take over the throne)\n\n# Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Cyrus Reza Pahlavi,]] eldest son of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]]\n# Prince [[Ali-Reza Pahlavi|Ali Reza Pahlavi II,]] youngest son of Mohammad Reza Shah\n# Prince [[Patrick Ali Pahlavi]], son of Prince [[Ali Reza Pahlavi I]].

So if the Pahlavi Dynasty returns to Iran now, with Crown Prince Cyrus Reza as the King, here is how the succession order might look like:\n\n# Princess [[Princess Noor Pahlavi|Noor Pahlavi,]] eldest daughter of Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Cyrus Reza]] \n# Princess [[Iman Pahlavi]], second daughter of Crown Prince Cyrus Reza\n# Princess [[Farah Pahlavi, Princess of Iran|Farah

The dynasty was founded by [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah of Iran]].\n\nThe Pahlavis came to power after [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler of Iran, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The Iranian parliament, known as the ''[[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]'', convening as a [[Constituent Assembly]] on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (''[[Shah]]'') of Imperial State of [[Name of Iran|Persia]]. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] asked foreign delegates to use the [[endonym]] [[Name of Iran|Iran]] in formal correspondence and the official name the Imperial State of Iran was adopted.\n\nFollowing the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in 1953 supported by United Kingdom and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the [[Iranian Revolution|end]] of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922151735/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |archivedate=22 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] ethnicity.

In 1935, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that \"[[Persia]]\" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called \"Iran\" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.\n\nReza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the [[Soviet Union]]. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in [[World War II]]. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a [[neutral country]], but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to [[sabotage]] British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.\n\n==World War II==\n{{History of Iran}}\n{{Main|Invasion of Iran (1941)}}\nOn 13 September 1943 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946.<ref name=Jessup>{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945\u20131985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}</ref> At the time, the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]], a [[communist party]] that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in [[Tehran]] were occupied and the [[Isfahan]] branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan]] had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party.<ref name=\"Jessup\" /><ref>''The Iranian Crisis of 1945\u20131946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict'', by Fred H.

His wife was crowned as the [[Shahbanu]] of Iran.]]\n[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].\n\nIn 1951, the ''Majlis'' (the [[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] as new prime minister by a vote of 79\u201312, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see [[Abadan Crisis]]). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see [[Operation Ajax]]). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.\n\nMajor plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.\n\n==Collapse of the dynasty==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}\n[[File:Shah and Farah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and his wife left Iran on 16 January 1979.]]\n[[File:ShahVaRohanioon1.jpg|thumb|The last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] meets clergy. Some of Iranian clergy opposed him while some others supported him as \"The only Shi'ite ruler\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\n\nThe Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, [[SAVAK]]. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the \"[[White Revolution]]\". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]]. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the [[SAVAMA]]. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. [[Hossein Fardoust]], who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.\n\nMohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in [[Egypt]], Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of [[Anwar Sadat]]. On his death, his son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi]] succeeded him ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as heir apparent to the Pahlavi dynasty.

Jesse was born in Kearney, Missouri in 1847, going on to become one of the most famous outlaws in the American Wild West.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== Littor Strand ===\nLittor Strand is a lovely, family-friendly, Green Flag beach, which stretches for miles along the Estuary into the adjoining Beale Beach.  Home to Bottlenose Dolphins and migrant waders, such as the Brent Geese seen below, the beach is an ideal place to unwind.\n\nThe beach plays host to numerous resident species of birdlife, including Oystercatchers, Curlews, Dunlins, and various types of Seagull.\n[[File:Littor Sunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset on Littor Strand]]\n\n\nGiven the beach is located close to the Atlantic coast, we are treated to some spectacular, unspoiled sunsets during the year. Also, with the vast, sandy beach at low tide, it is an ideal location for dogs to enjoy their own little bit of heaven on earth.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== \"The Buildings\" ===\nTullahinell House, known as \u201cThe Buildings\u201d, was the former Landlord\u2019s residence of Maxwell V. Blacker-Douglas. During the famine, Douglas provided employment on his farm for many in the area.\n\nThere was also a mill located here in the late-1800s, the stream for which no longer exists, having originally been artificially diverted to the Buildings. \n\nIn the early 1900s, the Buildings was at times used as a refuge for Republicans fleeing British authorities. It also played host to a meeting of important senior Republican figures, including Cathal Brugha and Arthur Griffith, during the War of Independence.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== Asdee Church ===\nThe church in the village was built in 1835 and paid for by the Hickie family for the people of Asdee. The church was extended and renovated in 1964.\n\nThe Hickies came from Clare, where they had been chiefs and hereditary physicians to the Kings of Munster, before having their lands confiscated and given to Cromwellian settlers in the 1650s.\n\nThe family moved, settled in & built Kilelton House, between Asdee & Ballylongford. For nearly three centuries, the family were benefactors to the villages of Asdee & Ballylongford. Until the inception of the National Education Act, the family had been managers of the boys and girls schools in Asdee.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== St Eoin's Well ===\nSt Eoin\u2019s Well, located near the village, hosts an annual mass every June.

Jesse was born in Kearney, Missouri in 1847, going on to become one of the most famous outlaws in the American Wild West.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== Littor Strand ===\nLittor Strand is a lovely, family-friendly, Green Flag beach, which stretches for miles along the Estuary into the adjoining Beale Beach.  Home to Bottlenose Dolphins and migrant waders, such as the Brent Geese seen below, the beach is an ideal place to unwind.\n\nThe beach plays host to numerous resident species of birdlife, including Oystercatchers, Curlews, Dunlins, and various types of Seagull.\n[[File:Littor Sunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset on Littor Strand]]\n\n\nGiven the beach is located close to the Atlantic coast, we are treated to some spectacular, unspoiled sunsets during the year. Also, with the vast, sandy beach at low tide, it is an ideal location for dogs to enjoy their own little bit of heaven on earth.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== \"The Buildings\" ===\nTullahinell House, known as \u201cThe Buildings\u201d, was the former Landlord\u2019s residence of Maxwell V. Blacker-Douglas. During the famine, Douglas provided employment on his farm for many in the area.\n\nThere was also a mill located here in the late-1800s, the stream for which no longer exists, having originally been artificially diverted to the Buildings. \n\nIn the early 1900s, the Buildings was at times used as a refuge for Republicans fleeing British authorities. It also played host to a meeting of important senior Republican figures, including Cathal Brugha and Arthur Griffith, during the War of Independence.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== Asdee Church ===\nThe church in the village was built in 1835 and paid for by the Hickie family for the people of Asdee. The church was extended and renovated in 1964.\n\nThe Hickies came from Clare, where they had been chiefs and hereditary physicians to the Kings of Munster, before having their lands confiscated and given to Cromwellian settlers in the 1650s.\n\nThe family moved, settled in & built Kilelton House, between Asdee & Ballylongford. For nearly three centuries, the family were benefactors to the villages of Asdee & Ballylongford. Until the inception of the National Education Act, the family had been managers of the boys and girls schools in Asdee.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== St Eoin's Well ===\nSt Eoin\u2019s Well, located near the village, hosts an annual mass every June. The well has been historically attributed to healing properties.[http://asdeevillage.com/about/]\n\n=== The Shannon Way Trail ===\nThe Shannon Way Walking Trail gives a picturesque view of the Shannon Estuary.
