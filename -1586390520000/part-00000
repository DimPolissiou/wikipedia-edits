In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BC), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BC may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BC.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BC than the traditional dating to the second millennium BC.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BC.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea.

In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]]. Three of these, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the [[Synoptic Gospels]], give similar accounts. The Gospel of John account varies more significantly.<ref name=\"Puskas\"/>\n\nScholars do not agree on which events surrounding the death of Jesus should be considered part of the 'Passion narrative', and which ones merely precede and succeed the actual Passion narrative itself.

Jesus gives final instructions, [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|predicts his betrayal]], and tells them all to remember him.\n* Jesus predicts the Denial of Peter: on the path to [[Gethsemane]] after the meal, Jesus tells the disciples they will all fall away that night. After [[Saint Peter|Peter]] protests he will not, Jesus says Peter will deny him three times before the cock crows.\n* The [[Agony in the Garden]]: later that night at Gethsemane, Jesus prays while the disciples rest. [[Luke 22:43\u201344]] adds that Jesus was terrified, and sweat blood; however, the oldest manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke do not contain these two verses, the other three canonical gospels don't mention this event either, and various manuscripts contain these verses elsewhere, even in the Gospel of Matthew (suggesting repeated attempts at insertion); thus, most modern scholars consider this tradition a later [[Christian interpolation]], probably to counter [[docetism]].<ref name=Aland>{{Cite book |last=Aland |first= Kurt |authorlink=Kurt Aland |last2=Aland |first2=Barbara |authorlink2=Barbara Aland |others=Erroll F.

During the arrest in Gethsemane, someone (Peter according to John) takes a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant, Malchus.\n* The [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]] at the high priest's palace, later that night. The arresting party brings Jesus to the [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish supreme court); according to Luke's Gospel, Jesus is beaten by his Jewish guards prior to his examination;<ref>{{bible verse||Luke|22:63}}</ref> the court examines him, in the course of which, according to John's Gospel, Jesus is struck in the face by one of the Jewish officials;<ref>{{bibleverse||John|18:22}}</ref> the court determine he deserves to die. According to Matthew's Gospel, the court then \"[[Mocking of Jesus#First stage|spat in his face and struck him with their fists.]]\"<ref>{{bible verse||Matthew|26:67}}</ref> They then send him to [[Pontius Pilate]]. According to the synoptic gospels, the high priest who examines Jesus is [[Caiaphas]]; in John, Jesus is also interrogated by [[Annas]], Caiaphas' father-in-law.\n* The [[Denial of Peter]] in the courtyard outside the high priest's palace, the same time. Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus\u2019 fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, ''Alexander'' and ''Rufus.'' However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\")<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>  Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on  Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role.  Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version.  Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC).  This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people.  By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God.  The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy.  For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.  He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second  prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross.  From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah.  For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people.  All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019  Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper... Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books.  But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion.  For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn... He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God...and glorieth that he hath God for his father.  Let us see then if his words be true... For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.  Let us examine him by outrages and tortures... Let us condemn him to a most shameful death ... These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.  Namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them.  He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water... For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019  And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third ''prophecy'', the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the ''cup'' he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others.  Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to ''the Passion''. The ''cup'' is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross.  Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service.  These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (''i.e.'': when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\") <ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion\u2014from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]\u2014during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777.  Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day.  During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes  prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nFor a full list of the subjects forming narrative works of art on the Passion, or episodes from it, see [[Life of Christ in art]].  Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects.  The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions.  [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story.  The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].   Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]].  This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]].  The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours.  They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''.  The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King.  [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section.  One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels.

It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\".

[[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus.

Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, ''Alexander'' and ''Rufus.'' However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\")<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>  Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on  Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role.  Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version.  Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC).  This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people.  By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God.  The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy.  For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.  He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second  prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross.  From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah.  For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people.  All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019  Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper... Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books.  But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion.  For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn... He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God...and glorieth that he hath God for his father.  Let us see then if his words be true... For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.  Let us examine him by outrages and tortures... Let us condemn him to a most shameful death ... These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.  Namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them.  He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water... For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019  And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third ''prophecy'', the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the ''cup'' he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others.  Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to ''the Passion''. The ''cup'' is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross.  Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service.  These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (''i.e.'': when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\") <ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion\u2014from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]\u2014during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777.  Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day.  During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes  prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nFor a full list of the subjects forming narrative works of art on the Passion, or episodes from it, see [[Life of Christ in art]].  Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects.  The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions.  [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story.  The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].   Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]].  This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]].  The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours.  They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''.  The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King.  [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section.  One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels.

It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates. However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide. Traditional Bethlehem cloth is striped like pajama material.<ref>Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, exhibition notes</ref> It would thus appear that Jesus' \"[[Seamless robe of Jesus|seamless robe]]\" was made of cloth from either Bethlehem or Damascus.\n*A tradition linked to [[icon]]s of Jesus holds that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] was a pious woman of Jerusalem who then gave [[Veil of Veronica|her kerchief]] to him to wipe his forehead.
