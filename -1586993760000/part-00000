{"title_page": "Historiography of the May Revolution", "text_new": "[[File:BartolomeMitre002.JPG|thumb|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] wrote one of the first historical interpretations of the May Revolution.]]\n[[Historiography|Historiographical studies]] of the [[May Revolution]] started in the second half of the 19th century in [[Argentina]] and have extended to modern day. All historiographical perspectives agree in considering the May Revolution as the turning point that gave birth to the modern nation of Argentina, and that the Revolution was unavoidable in 1810. The main topics of disagreement between Argentine historians are the specific weight of the diverse [[causes of the May Revolution]], who were the leaders of it among the different involved parties, whenever there was popular support for it or not, and whenever the loyalty to the captive Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]] was real or an elaborate masquerade to conceal pro-independence purposes.\n\n==Factual concerns==\nHistorians do not face many doubts or unknown details. The most important details were properly recorded at the time, and made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, the different historical views on the topic differ on interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events rather than the accuracy of the depiction of the event themselves. The modern historical vision of the revolutionary events do not differ significantly from the contemporary ones.\n\nThe only factual topics that remain unconfirmed are the quotes and speeches made at the Open Cabildo or the audience with Cisneros, as the quotes kept do not come from transcriptions or recordings but from memories wrote years later or from oral tradition. Another disputed topic is the existence or not of the [[Operations plan]], a secret document allegedly written by [[Mariano Moreno]] and setting harsh way for the [[Primera Junta]] to achieve its goals. Supporters of it consider that it is coherent with the actions taken by the Junta, like the execution of [[Santiago de Liniers]], while detractors consider it a literary forgery made by an enemy of the Revolution in order to harm its public image in Europe.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= Mariano Moreno, \"El sabiecito del sur\"\n|last= Galasso\n|first= Norberto\n|authorlink= Norberto Galasso\n|year= 2004\n|publisher= Colihue\n|location= uruapan michoacan estado unido islamico \n|language= spanish\n|isbn= 950-581-799-1\n|pages= 25\u201348\n}}</ref>\n\nIt is a topic of discussion which were the reasons to create a Junta with Cisneros, instead of following the results of the open cabildo in the first place. Historian [[Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n]] considers that the formula responded to Benito Lue y Riega's proposal of keeping the Viceroy in power along with partners or attachments, even though it was defeated at the open cabildo vote. Abad de Santill\u00e1n argues that this formula made the lobbyists believe they could contain the growing threat of revolution.<ref>Abad de Santill\u00e1n, p. 410 {{lang-es|Los resultados del congreso general del 22 de mayo hab\u00edan sido burlados y los cabildantes creyeron que hab\u00eda sido contenido de ese modo la revoluci\u00f3n amenazante de la calle.}}<br/>{{lang-en|The results of the general congress of may 22 were ignored and the members of the Cabildo thought they had contained the threatening revolution of the streets.}}</ref> [[F\u00e9lix Luna]], on the other hand, considers that it was an effort to avoid further conflicts, by choosing a middle ground solution, conceding something to all involved parties. Cisneros would remain in office, but sharing the power with the criollos.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 34 {{Lang-es|Por otra parte, en un evidente esfuerzo por evitar conflictos y suavizar los efectos de su resoluci\u00f3n, el cuerpo capitular design\u00f3 una Junta \"de coalici\u00f3n\". [...] Era una inteligente soluci\u00f3n intermedia, pero el ambiente de Buenos Aires no era propicio para estas v\u00edas.}}\n<br/>\n{{Lang-en|Besides, in a clear attempt to avoid conflicts and smooth the effects of the resolution, the capitular chapter designed a \"coalition\" Junta. [...] It was an intelligent middle-ground solution, but the mood of Buenos Aires was not prepared for that route.}}</ref>\n\nIt is also unclear which person or group decided the members of the Primera Junta. Saavedra claims in [[Memoria aut\u00f3grafa|his memoirs]], as do liberal historians like [[Vicente Fidel L\u00f3pez]], that it was exclusively a product of the popular initiative.<ref>Scenna, p. 39</ref> Others, such as historian [[F\u00e9lix Luna]], feel the proposal shows such a level of balance among the relevant political and ideological parties involved that it can't be considered as merely the result of an improvised popular initiative.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 39 {{Lang-es|Las personalidades incluidas representaban con tanta nitidez las fuerzas pol\u00edticas e ideol\u00f3gicas y los intereses en juego, que no puede suponerse fueron el fruto de una improvisaci\u00f3n}}\n<br/>\n{{Lang-en|The people included clearly represented the political and ideological forces and interests at stake, so that it can't be considered the fruit of an improvised initiative.}}</ref> The proposed President, Saavedra, made a decisive intervention in the revolution and had prestige among all parties involved. Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso, Manuel Belgrano, Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli, and Mariano Moreno were lawyers influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and the first three were former supporters of the Carlotist project. Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu were peninsulars involved in commercial activities of some importance. Both of them were supporters of [[Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga]], as was Moreno. Miguel de Azcu\u00e9naga was a military man with contacts in high society, and the priest Manuel Alberti represented the aspirations of the lower clergy. [[Miguel Angel Scenna]] points out in his book ''[[Las brevas maduras]]'' that \"such balance could not have been the result of chance, or from influences from outside the local context, but of a compromise of the parties involved\". Both authors deny the theory that the composition of the Junta may have been suggested by the British; there was no time for that, and there were no British people in Buenos Aires important enough to influence such matters.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 40 {{Lang-es|Con ello se refutan, de paso, las infundadas versiones que de tiempo en tiempo han circulado en nuestra historiograf\u00eda dando por posible que la Primera Junta haya sido producto de sugerencias brit\u00e1nicas. Ni hubo tiempo para hacerlo ni hab\u00eda ning\u00fan ingl\u00e9s importante en Buenos Aires como para asumir semejante responsabilidad.}}\n<br/>\n{{Lang-en|This would refute, incidentally, the unfounded versions that from time to time have circulated in our historiography, considering it possible for the Primera Junta to have been the product of British suggestions. There was no time to do so, and there was no notable Englishman in Buenos Aires to take on such a responsibility.}}</ref> Finally, the idea of the junta being chosen by the military is unlikely; despite the presence of Saavedra as president of the junta, it wasn't a [[military Junta]]; the majority of its members were civilians. Even more, it included Mariano Moreno, whose enmity with Saavedra dated from the failed mutiny of 1809.<ref>Scenna, p. 44-45</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThe first people who wrote about the Revolution were most of the protagonists themselves of it, writing memories, biographies or diaries. However, their works were motivated by other purposes than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or manifest their support or rejection for public figures or ideas of the time.<ref>Gelman, p. 32</ref> For example, [[Manuel Moreno]] wrote the biography of his brother Mariano to use it as propaganda for the Revolution in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his [[Memoria aut\u00f3grafa|autobiography]] at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself before his sons. Some points shared between those writings are the mentions to the British Invasions as a clear antecedent, the pride about the [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent nature]] of the Revolution at its first stages, the rejection to the later developments of the [[Argentine Civil War]], and the description of the events as the [[Retroversion of the sovereignty of the people|recovery of the sovereignty]] delegated to the kKing.<ref>Gelman, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe first remarkable historiographical school of interpretation of the history of Argentina was founded by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]], in his book ''[[Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina]]''. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political [[egalitarianism]], the conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and the attempt to establish a national organization on [[Constitutionalism|constitutional principles]] as opposed to the [[Charismatic authority|leadership]] of the [[caudillo]]s.<ref name=\"inconclusa\">{{cite book\n|title= Mayo, la revoluci\u00f3n inconclusa\n|last= Poli Gonzalvo\n|first= Alejandro\n|authorlink= Alejandro Poli Gonzalvo\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= Emec\u00e9 Editores S.A.\n|location= [[Buenos Aires]]\n|isbn= 978-950-04-3030-2\n|page= 22}}</ref> Mitre introduced the idea that the nation of [[Argentina]] existed prior to 1810, and that it was subjugated up to that point by the Spanish authorities.<ref>Gelman, p. 15</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Esteban Echeverr\u00eda]] epitomized the ideals of May in the concepts of [[Progress (history)|progress]] and [[democracy]]. In the future, these concepts would be the axis around which revisionist history would differ from the canonical history in reference to the events of May. The canonical version claimed progress and justify the abandonment or delay the realization of democratic ideals in order not to risk the economic prosperity of society arguing that even then was not able to properly take advantage of political freedom. This situation was known as the establishment of the \"Possible Republic.\"<ref name=\"inconclusa\"/> Mitre and Echeverr\u00eda were part of the '37 Generation, a group of [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors born during the revolution itself and formed in the local context generated after it. Those authors did not work purely in intellectual fields, but took instead active part in the political events of their time, and strongly opposed the governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. They were closer to the unitarians than to the federalists, but were not fully unitarians either: they thought that it wasn't enough to apply directly the new ideas generated in Europe or the United States, but instead to adapt them to the local contexts of the R\u00edo de la Plata.<ref>Gelman, p. 132</ref> They choose the May Revolution as the point to mark the birth of the nation because of their rejection to the Spanish or aboriginal cultures.<ref>Gelman, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe last years of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were marked in Argentina by a growing industrialization process and the arrival of huge numbers of European immigrants. Historiographical studies were increased by the \"''New Historical school''\", in order to forge a \"national identity\", and the May Revolution had great prominence. There were discussions about the level of influence that the many [[causes of the May Revolution]] actually had, or whose interventions were the most decisive, but two points shared by all historians were to consider the May Revolution as the birth of Argentina, and to consider it an inevitable consequence of the causes that led to it (meaning, the chance of the May Revolution never taking place is not considered a feasible possibility by historians).<ref>Gelman, p. 16-17</ref> There was also a subtle change: the scope of the revolution as a subject of study originally ''started'' with the events of May 1810 in Buenos Aires and kept going on for decades. They were later split, and the name \"May Revolution\" made reference only to events that led to the removal of Cisneros and the creation of the Primera Junta.<ref>Gelman, p. 17-18</ref> A new element added by those historians was to consider, either to support or reject the idea, whenever there was an active and strong popular support for the Revolution, instead of explaining it solely around the actions of a limited number of enlightened men.<ref>Gelman, p. 193</ref> Nevertheless, they kept the previous approaches for the most part.<ref>Gelman, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe academic consensus of the end of the 19th century began to be questioned by the time of the World Wars, when liberalism lost its former hegemony and fascism and left-wing ideologies became important. Liberalism attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective, though [[Ricardo Levene]] and the ''[[National Academy of History of Argentina|National Academy of History]]''.<ref>Gelman, p. 256</ref> This school of thought kept most of the viewpoints of Mitre. Left-wing authors opposed it with a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] production, based in nationalism and anti-imperialism. However, revisionists would work mainly with the [[historiography of Juan Manuel de Rosas]], [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] or Mitre himself, without working much with the War of Independence, and in fact [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] was equally supported by both genres.<ref name=\"rev\">Gelman, p.257</ref> Nevertheless, they deemphasized the idea of a conflict between criollos and peninsulars, and described it instead as a conflict between liberalism and absolutism.<ref name=\"rev\"/> The fascist author [[Hugo Wast]] would describe the Revolution as a military coup carried out by military leaders, and where the population was completely uninvolved.\n\nThe 150\u00ba anniversary of the May Revolution found the liberal and revisionist historiographies opposing each other more strongly. The senator from Corrientes J. An\u00edbal D\u00e1vila promoted the republication of old documents so that \"''the intentions of the antihistory of Argentina does not confuse the current generations, the masses and the youth with misleading slogans''\".<ref>Gelman, p. 309</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rosa]] would react by stating that the Revolution was carried out by the masses and that those were shadowed by other figures by liberal historians seeking to falsify history.<ref name=\"Gelman, p. 312\">Gelman, p. 312</ref> The perspectives of Rosa found great acceptance in society and are currently part of the Argentine historic common sense.<ref name=\"Gelman, p. 312\"/>\n\nBy the 1970 decade authors like [[Tulio Halperin Donghi]] or [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Chiaramonte]] attempted to provide a less absolute perspective about the May Revolution, by making detailed analysis of the local and international contexts and the possible options that the revolutionaries had at their disposal, with the Revolution being one option among many others.<ref>Gelman, p. 19</ref>\n\n==Disputes==\n\n===Revolutionary purposes===\n<!-- This subsection is linked from [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America]], fix that article if this section is renamed -->\n[[File:Fernando VII en un campamento, por Goya.jpg|thumb|The May Revolution declared loyalty to [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].]]\nThe government created on May 25 was pronounced loyal to the deposed Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]], but historians do not agree on whenever such loyalty was genuine or not. Since Mitre, many historians consider that such loyalty was merely a political deception to gain factual autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Grandes protagonistas de la historia argentina: Mariano Moreno|last=Luna|first=F\u00e9lix|publisher=Planeta|year=2004|isbn=950-49-1248-6|location=Buenos Aires|page=25|pages=|language=es|chapter=Consecuencias de la asonada|quote={{lang-es|El joven abogado sigue fiel a su posici\u00f3n, y sabe que el sector juvenil y republicano del partido patriota lo apoya.

The ruse is known as the \"''Mask of Ferdinand VII''\" and would have been upheld by the [[Primera Junta]], the [[Junta Grande]], and the First and Second Triumvirates. The [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] was intended to declare [[Independence|independency]], but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members; however, it suppressed mentions to Ferdinand VII from official documents. The supreme directors held an ambivalent attitude until the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence of 1816]].\n\nFor Britain the change was favorable, as it facilitated trade with the cities of the area without seeing it hampered by the monopoly that Spain maintained over their colonies. However, Britain prioritized the war in Europe against France, allied with the Spanish power sector that had not yet been submitted, and could not appear to support American independentist movements or allow military attention of Spain being divided into two different fronts. Consequently, they pushed for independence demonstrations not being made explicit. This pressure was exerted by [[Lord Strangford]], the British ambassador at the court of Rio de Janeiro, expressing support to the Junta, but conditioned \"''...if the behavior is consistent and that Capital retained on behalf of Mr. Dn. Fernando VII and his legitimate successors.''\"<ref name=\"WWK\">{{cite book\n|title= British Policy and the Independence of Latin America\n|authorlink= William W.

Alberdi thought that \"''The Argentine revolution is a chapter of the Hispanoamerican revolution, which is such of the Spanish one, and this, as well, of the European revolution.''\" They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between the new libertarian ideas and [[Autocracy|absolutism]], without the intention to cut the relation with Spain, but to reformulate it. Thus, it would have the characteristics of a [[civil war]] instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Mart\u00edn had lived so far most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Mart\u00edn talked about the enemies, he called them \"[[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]]\" or \"[[Goths]]\", but never \"Spanish\".\n\nAccording to those historians, the Spanish revolution against absolutism got mixed with the [[Peninsular War]]. Charles IV was seen as an absolutist king, and by standing against his father many Spanish got the wrong understanding that Ferdinand VII sympathized with the new enlighten ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of Ferdinand VII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution or the one in Chile) would have been seeking to replace the absolutist power with others made under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals themselves of the French Revolution ([[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|liberty, equality and fraternity]]) were still respected by those people. However, those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack, which promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping the old order of maintaining the new one. This situation would have changed with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, as he [[Absolutist Restauration|restored absolutism]] and persecuted the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For the people in South America, the idea of remaining as part of the Spanish Empire, but with a new relation with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point would have been a return to absolutism, or independentism.\n\n====Documents====\n[[Cornelio Saavedra]] spoke about the issue privately with [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Viamonte]] in a letter from 27 June 1811, addressing topics such as a known display of independentism by [[M\u00e1ximo de Zamudio]]. This letter was subsequently rescued. In it, he explicitly mentioned the situation as a deception to avoid England from declaring war on them.\n\n{{cquote|Foreign courts, and very specially the British one, demand nothing, save that we carry on the name of Ferdinand and the hate to Napoleon.

In them you can see by yourself it is expressly said that the British court declares not to feel itself compeled by any convention to sustain a part of the Spanish monarchy against the other, for reason of some remaining disagreement among them about the type of government, in which they have to rule their respective systems, under the condition that they recognize their legitimate sovereign, and they oppose the tyranny and the usurpation of the France. Thus, if we did not recognize Ferdinand, Britain would have the right or feel itself obliged to sustain our enemies that do so, and would declare war upon us, same as if we did not despise Napoleon; and what forces does the poor viceroyalty of Buenos Aires have to resist this power in the first steps of its childhood?

The progressive Criollos and young people, represented on the Junta by Moreno, Castelli, Belgrano and Paso, aspired to far-reaching political, economic and social reforms. Moreover, the military and bureaucrats, whose views were carried forward by Saavedra, simply wanted a renewal of office holders, aspiring to remove the Spanish from the exclusive use of power, but inheriting their privileges and powers. The merchants and landlords subordinated the political issues to the economic decisions, particularly with respect to the opening or not of trade with England. Finally, some groups shuffled possibilities to replace the authority of the Regency Council with that of Charlotte of Portugal or the British crown, but such projects have had limited impact. These groups worked together for the common goal of expelling Cisneros from power, but after the Primera Junta was settled they began to express their internal differences.\n\nNo [[religion|religious]] factors were involved in the revolution: all the revolutionaries and royalists agreed to support [[Catholicism]]. Still, most church leaders opposed the revolution. In Upper Peru the royalists and religious authorities sought to equate the revolutionaries with heretics, but the revolutionary leaders always promoted conciliatory policies in the religious aspects. For instance, Mariano Moreno translated [[The Social Contract]] to Spanish, but left aside the chapters that criticized religion. The priests and monks, however, were divided geographically: the provinces \"from below\" were loyal to the revolution, while those of Upper Peru preferred to remain loyal to the monarchy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[May Revolution]]\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book\n|title= Doscientos a\u00f1os pensando la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo\n|last= Gelman\n|first= Jorge\n|authorlink= Jorge Gelman\n|author2=Ra\u00fal Fradkin\n|year= 2010\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|location= Buenos Aires\n|isbn= 978-950-07-3179-9}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.redaccionpopular.com/content/corrientes-interpretativas-de-la-revoluci%C3%B3n-de-mayo-de-1810 Corrientes interpretativas de la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo de 1810] {{in lang|es}}\n\n{{May Revolution}}\n{{Historiography}}\n\n[[Category:Historiography of Argentina]]\n[[Category:May Revolution]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:BartolomeMitre002.JPG|thumb|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] wrote one of the first historical interpretations of the May Revolution.]]\n[[Historiography|Historiographical studies]] of the [[May Revolution]] started in the second half of the 19th century in [[Argentina]] and have extended to modern day. All historiographical perspectives agree in considering the May Revolution as the turning point that gave birth to the modern nation of Argentina, and that the Revolution was unavoidable in 1810. The main topics of disagreement between Argentine historians are the specific weight of the diverse [[causes of the May Revolution]], who were the leaders of it among the different involved parties, whenever there was popular support for it or not, and whenever the loyalty to the captive Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]] was real or an elaborate masquerade to conceal pro-independence purposes.\n\n==Factual concerns==\nHistorians do not face many doubts or unknown details. The most important details were properly recorded at the time, and made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, the different historical views on the topic differ on interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events rather than the accuracy of the depiction of the event themselves. The modern historical vision of the revolutionary events do not differ significantly from the contemporary ones.\n\nThe only factual topics that remain unconfirmed are the quotes and speeches made at the Open Cabildo or the audience with Cisneros, as the quotes kept do not come from transcriptions or recordings but from memories wrote years later or from oral tradition. Another disputed topic is the existence or not of the [[Operations plan]], a secret document allegedly written by [[Mariano Moreno]] and setting harsh way for the [[Primera Junta]] to achieve its goals. Supporters of it consider that it is coherent with the actions taken by the Junta, like the execution of [[Santiago de Liniers]], while detractors consider it a literary forgery made by an enemy of the Revolution in order to harm its public image in Europe.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= Mariano Moreno, \"El sabiecito del sur\"\n|last= Galasso\n|first= Norberto\n|authorlink= Norberto Galasso\n|year= 2004\n|publisher= Colihue\n|location= Buenos Aires, Argentina\n|language= spanish\n|isbn= 950-581-799-1\n|pages= 25\u201348\n}}</ref>\n\nIt is a topic of discussion which were the reasons to create a Junta with Cisneros, instead of following the results of the open cabildo in the first place. Historian [[Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n]] considers that the formula responded to Benito Lue y Riega's proposal of keeping the Viceroy in power along with partners or attachments, even though it was defeated at the open cabildo vote. Abad de Santill\u00e1n argues that this formula made the lobbyists believe they could contain the growing threat of revolution.<ref>Abad de Santill\u00e1n, p. 410 {{lang-es|Los resultados del congreso general del 22 de mayo hab\u00edan sido burlados y los cabildantes creyeron que hab\u00eda sido contenido de ese modo la revoluci\u00f3n amenazante de la calle.}}<br/>{{lang-en|The results of the general congress of may 22 were ignored and the members of the Cabildo thought they had contained the threatening revolution of the streets.}}</ref> [[F\u00e9lix Luna]], on the other hand, considers that it was an effort to avoid further conflicts, by choosing a middle ground solution, conceding something to all involved parties. Cisneros would remain in office, but sharing the power with the criollos.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 34 {{Lang-es|Por otra parte, en un evidente esfuerzo por evitar conflictos y suavizar los efectos de su resoluci\u00f3n, el cuerpo capitular design\u00f3 una Junta \"de coalici\u00f3n\".

[...] It was an intelligent middle-ground solution, but the mood of Buenos Aires was not prepared for that route.}}</ref>\n\nIt is also unclear which person or group decided the members of the Primera Junta. Saavedra claims in [[Memoria aut\u00f3grafa|his memoirs]], as do liberal historians like [[Vicente Fidel L\u00f3pez]], that it was exclusively a product of the popular initiative.<ref>Scenna, p. 39</ref> Others, such as historian [[F\u00e9lix Luna]], feel the proposal shows such a level of balance among the relevant political and ideological parties involved that it can't be considered as merely the result of an improvised popular initiative.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 39 {{Lang-es|Las personalidades incluidas representaban con tanta nitidez las fuerzas pol\u00edticas e ideol\u00f3gicas y los intereses en juego, que no puede suponerse fueron el fruto de una improvisaci\u00f3n}}\n<br/>\n{{Lang-en|The people included clearly represented the political and ideological forces and interests at stake, so that it can't be considered the fruit of an improvised initiative.}}</ref> The proposed President, Saavedra, made a decisive intervention in the revolution and had prestige among all parties involved. Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso, Manuel Belgrano, Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli, and Mariano Moreno were lawyers influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and the first three were former supporters of the Carlotist project. Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu were peninsulars involved in commercial activities of some importance. Both of them were supporters of [[Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga]], as was Moreno. Miguel de Azcu\u00e9naga was a military man with contacts in high society, and the priest Manuel Alberti represented the aspirations of the lower clergy. [[Miguel Angel Scenna]] points out in his book ''[[Las brevas maduras]]'' that \"such balance could not have been the result of chance, or from influences from outside the local context, but of a compromise of the parties involved\". Both authors deny the theory that the composition of the Junta may have been suggested by the British; there was no time for that, and there were no British people in Buenos Aires important enough to influence such matters.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 40 {{Lang-es|Con ello se refutan, de paso, las infundadas versiones que de tiempo en tiempo han circulado en nuestra historiograf\u00eda dando por posible que la Primera Junta haya sido producto de sugerencias brit\u00e1nicas.

There was no time to do so, and there was no notable Englishman in Buenos Aires to take on such a responsibility.}}</ref> Finally, the idea of the junta being chosen by the military is unlikely; despite the presence of Saavedra as president of the junta, it wasn't a [[military Junta]]; the majority of its members were civilians. Even more, it included Mariano Moreno, whose enmity with Saavedra dated from the failed mutiny of 1809.<ref>Scenna, p. 44-45</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThe first people who wrote about the Revolution were most of the protagonists themselves of it, writing memories, biographies or diaries. However, their works were motivated by other purposes than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or manifest their support or rejection for public figures or ideas of the time.<ref>Gelman, p. 32</ref> For example, [[Manuel Moreno]] wrote the biography of his brother Mariano to use it as propaganda for the Revolution in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his [[Memoria aut\u00f3grafa|autobiography]] at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself before his sons. Some points shared between those writings are the mentions to the British Invasions as a clear antecedent, the pride about the [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent nature]] of the Revolution at its first stages, the rejection to the later developments of the [[Argentine Civil War]], and the description of the events as the [[Retroversion of the sovereignty of the people|recovery of the sovereignty]] delegated to the kKing.<ref>Gelman, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe first remarkable historiographical school of interpretation of the history of Argentina was founded by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]], in his book ''[[Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina]]''. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political [[egalitarianism]], the conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and the attempt to establish a national organization on [[Constitutionalism|constitutional principles]] as opposed to the [[Charismatic authority|leadership]] of the [[caudillo]]s.<ref name=\"inconclusa\">{{cite book\n|title= Mayo, la revoluci\u00f3n inconclusa\n|last= Poli Gonzalvo\n|first= Alejandro\n|authorlink= Alejandro Poli Gonzalvo\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= Emec\u00e9 Editores S.A.\n|location= [[Buenos Aires]]\n|isbn= 978-950-04-3030-2\n|page= 22}}</ref> Mitre introduced the idea that the nation of [[Argentina]] existed prior to 1810, and that it was subjugated up to that point by the Spanish authorities.<ref>Gelman, p. 15</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Esteban Echeverr\u00eda]] epitomized the ideals of May in the concepts of [[Progress (history)|progress]] and [[democracy]]. In the future, these concepts would be the axis around which revisionist history would differ from the canonical history in reference to the events of May. The canonical version claimed progress and justify the abandonment or delay the realization of democratic ideals in order not to risk the economic prosperity of society arguing that even then was not able to properly take advantage of political freedom. This situation was known as the establishment of the \"Possible Republic.\"<ref name=\"inconclusa\"/> Mitre and Echeverr\u00eda were part of the '37 Generation, a group of [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors born during the revolution itself and formed in the local context generated after it. Those authors did not work purely in intellectual fields, but took instead active part in the political events of their time, and strongly opposed the governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. They were closer to the unitarians than to the federalists, but were not fully unitarians either: they thought that it wasn't enough to apply directly the new ideas generated in Europe or the United States, but instead to adapt them to the local contexts of the R\u00edo de la Plata.<ref>Gelman, p. 132</ref> They choose the May Revolution as the point to mark the birth of the nation because of their rejection to the Spanish or aboriginal cultures.<ref>Gelman, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe last years of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were marked in Argentina by a growing industrialization process and the arrival of huge numbers of European immigrants. Historiographical studies were increased by the \"''New Historical school''\", in order to forge a \"national identity\", and the May Revolution had great prominence. There were discussions about the level of influence that the many [[causes of the May Revolution]] actually had, or whose interventions were the most decisive, but two points shared by all historians were to consider the May Revolution as the birth of Argentina, and to consider it an inevitable consequence of the causes that led to it (meaning, the chance of the May Revolution never taking place is not considered a feasible possibility by historians).<ref>Gelman, p. 16-17</ref> There was also a subtle change: the scope of the revolution as a subject of study originally ''started'' with the events of May 1810 in Buenos Aires and kept going on for decades. They were later split, and the name \"May Revolution\" made reference only to events that led to the removal of Cisneros and the creation of the Primera Junta.<ref>Gelman, p. 17-18</ref> A new element added by those historians was to consider, either to support or reject the idea, whenever there was an active and strong popular support for the Revolution, instead of explaining it solely around the actions of a limited number of enlightened men.<ref>Gelman, p. 193</ref> Nevertheless, they kept the previous approaches for the most part.<ref>Gelman, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe academic consensus of the end of the 19th century began to be questioned by the time of the World Wars, when liberalism lost its former hegemony and fascism and left-wing ideologies became important. Liberalism attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective, though [[Ricardo Levene]] and the ''[[National Academy of History of Argentina|National Academy of History]]''.<ref>Gelman, p. 256</ref> This school of thought kept most of the viewpoints of Mitre. Left-wing authors opposed it with a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] production, based in nationalism and anti-imperialism. However, revisionists would work mainly with the [[historiography of Juan Manuel de Rosas]], [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] or Mitre himself, without working much with the War of Independence, and in fact [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] was equally supported by both genres.<ref name=\"rev\">Gelman, p.257</ref> Nevertheless, they deemphasized the idea of a conflict between criollos and peninsulars, and described it instead as a conflict between liberalism and absolutism.<ref name=\"rev\"/> The fascist author [[Hugo Wast]] would describe the Revolution as a military coup carried out by military leaders, and where the population was completely uninvolved.\n\nThe 150\u00ba anniversary of the May Revolution found the liberal and revisionist historiographies opposing each other more strongly. The senator from Corrientes J. An\u00edbal D\u00e1vila promoted the republication of old documents so that \"''the intentions of the antihistory of Argentina does not confuse the current generations, the masses and the youth with misleading slogans''\".<ref>Gelman, p. 309</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rosa]] would react by stating that the Revolution was carried out by the masses and that those were shadowed by other figures by liberal historians seeking to falsify history.<ref name=\"Gelman, p. 312\">Gelman, p. 312</ref> The perspectives of Rosa found great acceptance in society and are currently part of the Argentine historic common sense.<ref name=\"Gelman, p. 312\"/>\n\nBy the 1970 decade authors like [[Tulio Halperin Donghi]] or [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Chiaramonte]] attempted to provide a less absolute perspective about the May Revolution, by making detailed analysis of the local and international contexts and the possible options that the revolutionaries had at their disposal, with the Revolution being one option among many others.<ref>Gelman, p. 19</ref>\n\n==Disputes==\n\n===Revolutionary purposes===\n<!-- This subsection is linked from [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America]], fix that article if this section is renamed -->\n[[File:Fernando VII en un campamento, por Goya.jpg|thumb|The May Revolution declared loyalty to [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].]]\nThe government created on May 25 was pronounced loyal to the deposed Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]], but historians do not agree on whenever such loyalty was genuine or not.

The ruse is known as the \"''Mask of Ferdinand VII''\" and would have been upheld by the [[Primera Junta]], the [[Junta Grande]], and the First and Second Triumvirates. The [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] was intended to declare [[Independence|independency]], but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members; however, it suppressed mentions to Ferdinand VII from official documents. The supreme directors held an ambivalent attitude until the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence of 1816]].\n\nFor Britain the change was favorable, as it facilitated trade with the cities of the area without seeing it hampered by the monopoly that Spain maintained over their colonies. However, Britain prioritized the war in Europe against France, allied with the Spanish power sector that had not yet been submitted, and could not appear to support American independentist movements or allow military attention of Spain being divided into two different fronts. Consequently, they pushed for independence demonstrations not being made explicit. This pressure was exerted by [[Lord Strangford]], the British ambassador at the court of Rio de Janeiro, expressing support to the Junta, but conditioned \"''...if the behavior is consistent and that Capital retained on behalf of Mr. Dn. Fernando VII and his legitimate successors.''\"<ref name=\"WWK\">{{cite book\n|title= British Policy and the Independence of Latin America\n|authorlink= William W.

Alberdi thought that \"''The Argentine revolution is a chapter of the Hispanoamerican revolution, which is such of the Spanish one, and this, as well, of the European revolution.''\" They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between the new libertarian ideas and [[Autocracy|absolutism]], without the intention to cut the relation with Spain, but to reformulate it. Thus, it would have the characteristics of a [[civil war]] instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Mart\u00edn had lived so far most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Mart\u00edn talked about the enemies, he called them \"[[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]]\" or \"[[Goths]]\", but never \"Spanish\".\n\nAccording to those historians, the Spanish revolution against absolutism got mixed with the [[Peninsular War]]. Charles IV was seen as an absolutist king, and by standing against his father many Spanish got the wrong understanding that Ferdinand VII sympathized with the new enlighten ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of Ferdinand VII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution or the one in Chile) would have been seeking to replace the absolutist power with others made under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals themselves of the French Revolution ([[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|liberty, equality and fraternity]]) were still respected by those people. However, those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack, which promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping the old order of maintaining the new one. This situation would have changed with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, as he [[Absolutist Restauration|restored absolutism]] and persecuted the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For the people in South America, the idea of remaining as part of the Spanish Empire, but with a new relation with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point would have been a return to absolutism, or independentism.\n\n====Documents====\n[[Cornelio Saavedra]] spoke about the issue privately with [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Viamonte]] in a letter from 27 June 1811, addressing topics such as a known display of independentism by [[M\u00e1ximo de Zamudio]]. This letter was subsequently rescued. In it, he explicitly mentioned the situation as a deception to avoid England from declaring war on them.\n\n{{cquote|Foreign courts, and very specially the British one, demand nothing, save that we carry on the name of Ferdinand and the hate to Napoleon.

In them you can see by yourself it is expressly said that the British court declares not to feel itself compeled by any convention to sustain a part of the Spanish monarchy against the other, for reason of some remaining disagreement among them about the type of government, in which they have to rule their respective systems, under the condition that they recognize their legitimate sovereign, and they oppose the tyranny and the usurpation of the France. Thus, if we did not recognize Ferdinand, Britain would have the right or feel itself obliged to sustain our enemies that do so, and would declare war upon us, same as if we did not despise Napoleon; and what forces does the poor viceroyalty of Buenos Aires have to resist this power in the first steps of its childhood? Or what need does it have to willingly attract for itself this powerful and external enemy when it hasn't ended with the interior ones that keep bothering us to this day?

It detailed abuses made by the Spanish, and former chances for separatism that were not used. Of course, once the independence was declared openly, there would not have been any further need for keeping a masquerade of submission. In the specific case of the May Revolution, it says:\n\n{{cquote|In the meantime we established our government junta similar to those of Spain. Its establishment was merely provisional and in the name of the captive king Ferdinand. Viceroy Don Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros wrote instructions to the governors to prepare for the civil war and arm some provinces against the others.<ref>[http://www.lariojacultural.com.ar/Nota.asp?id=226 Manifiesto que hace a las naciones el Congreso General Constituyente de las Provincias Unidas del R\u00edo de La Plata sobre el Tratamiento y Crueldades que ha Sufrido de los Espa\u00f1oles y Motivado la Declaraci\u00f3n de su Independencia.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006170724/http://www.lariojacultural.com.ar/Nota.asp?id=226 |date=2011-10-06 }} Entretanto nosotros establecimos nuestra Junta de gobierno a semejanza de las de Espa\u00f1a.

El virrey don Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros expidi\u00f3 circulares a los gobernadores para que se preparasen a la guerra civil y armasen unas provincias contra otras.</ref>}}\n\n==Groups involved==\nThe groups who supported or carried out the revolution were not completely homogeneous in their purpose, and several had disparate interests together. The progressive Criollos and young people, represented on the Junta by Moreno, Castelli, Belgrano and Paso, aspired to far-reaching political, economic and social reforms. Moreover, the military and bureaucrats, whose views were carried forward by Saavedra, simply wanted a renewal of office holders, aspiring to remove the Spanish from the exclusive use of power, but inheriting their privileges and powers. The merchants and landlords subordinated the political issues to the economic decisions, particularly with respect to the opening or not of trade with England. Finally, some groups shuffled possibilities to replace the authority of the Regency Council with that of Charlotte of Portugal or the British crown, but such projects have had limited impact. These groups worked together for the common goal of expelling Cisneros from power, but after the Primera Junta was settled they began to express their internal differences.\n\nNo [[religion|religious]] factors were involved in the revolution: all the revolutionaries and royalists agreed to support [[Catholicism]]. Still, most church leaders opposed the revolution. In Upper Peru the royalists and religious authorities sought to equate the revolutionaries with heretics, but the revolutionary leaders always promoted conciliatory policies in the religious aspects. For instance, Mariano Moreno translated [[The Social Contract]] to Spanish, but left aside the chapters that criticized religion. The priests and monks, however, were divided geographically: the provinces \"from below\" were loyal to the revolution, while those of Upper Peru preferred to remain loyal to the monarchy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[May Revolution]]\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book\n|title= Doscientos a\u00f1os pensando la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo\n|last= Gelman\n|first= Jorge\n|authorlink= Jorge Gelman\n|author2=Ra\u00fal Fradkin\n|year= 2010\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|location= Buenos Aires\n|isbn= 978-950-07-3179-9}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.redaccionpopular.com/content/corrientes-interpretativas-de-la-revoluci%C3%B3n-de-mayo-de-1810 Corrientes interpretativas de la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo de 1810] {{in lang|es}}\n\n{{May Revolution}}\n{{Historiography}}\n\n[[Category:Historiography of Argentina]]\n[[Category:May Revolution]]\n", "name_user": "177.243.220.117", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFactual concerns)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_May_Revolution"}

They wear leather jackets, gold jewelry, and have pin straight hair.

Marieme and the girls grow close and she eventually begins to act and dress just like them.  After committing theft, the girls pay for a hotel room, steal dresses, drink alcohol, do drugs, lip sync to \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\", by [[Rihanna]], and dance all night long. At the hotel, Lady encourages Marieme to ignore her abusive older brother's phone calls and gives her a gold necklace with the name Vic for Victory.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nFighting is part of competing with other groups.<ref name=\"Girlhood\"/>  Lady sets up a fight with a girl in a rival group.  Unfortunately, Lady is beaten, and has her shirt torn off which is viewed as a disgrace.  Due to her loss, her father cuts all of her hair off and makes her keep her distance from the group.  Vic/Marieme, wants to prove to herself, as well as Lady, that she has the strength to beat their rival.  Vic wins the battle by ripping the girl's shirt off and cutting her bra, leaving her topless.  Both Lady and Vic's brother are incredibly proud of her.\n\nVic is physically assaulted by her brother when he finds out she slept with Ismael, so she leaves home and starts to work for Abou, a local drug dealer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abraham|first1=Amelia|title='Girlhood' Gives Young Black Girls Some Much-Needed Screen Time|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/celine-sciammas-new-film|website=Vice|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>  While working for Abou, Vic lives in an apartment with two male roommates.

When her boyfriend discovers she has been binding her breasts, they fight. \n\nAfterwards, she goes to a party at Abou's place where, despite her dressed down look, Abou approaches and tries to kiss her. She tells him no and pushes him away.  Vic goes to Ishmael's place to tell him she's done with Abou and he offers to let her stay at his place and marry her. Vic refuses, telling him she doesn't want that kind of life.

It is noted that the earl had not paid the tax. The earl's house in Kilwinning, Easter Chambers or the old abbot's dwelling, had 15 hearths. Thirty-seven other dwellings were listed within the barony of Eglinton.<ref name=\"Urquhart, Page 92\">Urquhart, Page 92</ref>\n\nThe stables were built from stones taken from the Easter Chambers of Kilwinning Abbey; being the Abbots lodgings and later that of the Earls of Eglinton. In 1784, over a period of four months, the building was demolished and the stones were taken to Eglinton.<ref>Service, Page 140</ref>\n\nThe construction of the new castle was not universally accepted as beneficial; Fullarton records that \"The hoary grandeur of the old fortalice lay deeply buried amid the dense groves of immemorial growth which closely invested and obscured it; no innovating projects of improvement, nor change of any kind, had ever been permitted to disturb the sanctity of its seclusion, or to ruffle the feelings even of the most fastiduous worshipper of things as they are, or, more properly perhaps, chance to be\".<ref>Fullarton, Page 85</ref> The castle is said to have had a moat.<ref>Anstruther, Page 27</ref>\n\n====Covenating times====\nIn the 1640s [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] had been sent by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Neil Montgomery of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] negotiated a 4,000 merks penalty for the Eglinton Estates; three tenants having already been killed, with some deer and sheep also taken from the park.<ref>Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior. Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society. {{ISBN|0-85411-059-3}}. p. 205.</ref>\n\n====Ley tunnels====\nPersistent rumours exist of a [[Ley tunnel]] which is said to run from Kilwinning Abbey, under the 'Bean Yaird', below the 'Easter Chaumers' and the 'Leddy firs', and then underneath the Garnock and on to Eglinton Castle. No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries which does exist under the old abbey.<ref>Service, page 48.</ref> A ley or an escape tunnel is also said to run from the castle to exit at the old waterfall near the rockery. It is reported that a tunnel ran from the castle to near the existing Castle Bridge. This tunnel was stone lined and tall enough for a man to walk through. This is likely to have been the main drain from the castle.\n\n===The Pleasure gardens===\n\n[[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1636 describes the landscape on his journey south from Glasgow as \"a barren and poor country\", but the earls had clearly enhanced Eglinton for he comments that the land at Irvine was \"dainty, pleasant, level, champaign country.\"<ref>Brereton</ref>\n[[File:Eglinton Temple, Kilwinning, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Temple which the Countess of Eglinton had proposed for the Belvidere Hill.]]\n\nThe grounds of the castle were described in one record of the 1840s as follows:\n\n''Its princely gates soon presented themselves and we thought we should easily find our way to Irvine through the park. It was a rich treat to wander in these extensive grounds. We soon made way through a handsome avenue to the gardens. The hot-houses for fruits and flowers are on a magnificent scale, and on reaching the parterre we were delighted with the elegance which pervaded it. A glassy river with a silvery cascade came gliding gently through these fairy regions, as though conscious of the luxuriant paradise which it was watering. Nor was the classic taste wanting, nor horticultural skill, to render this a region of enchantment. Two elegant cast-iron bridges, vases, statues, a sun-dial; these pretty combinations from the world of art could not fail to please the beholder. Leaving these luxurious regions we again wandered among thick woods, and occasionally obtained glimpses of the proud castle, peering over the trees. At length we found our way to a seat beneath some noble weepers of the ash tribe, and here we had a fine view of the castle, towering majestically over the dense foliage.''\n[[File:Map of Dunduff castle & roads.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Ayrshire by William Aiton, 1811]]\n''Among our wanderings we passed an enormous quadrangular building, resembling some of our London hospitals. It forms the stables, and it is quite detached, at some distance from the Castle. We mistook our way, owing to the many devious paths, and wandered deeper and deeper into the recesses of this extensive domain. In passing through one long avenue, which was so dark that we were unable to see our steps; myriads of rooks took flight at our approach, and the air was quite blackened with them. At one time, we found ourselves walking alongside of the preserves, at another we were wandering in the deer park, and startling the early slumbers of these pretty creatures. At length we reached a gate, which we fully expected would lead into the high road to Irvine: but, to our great consternation, we found it was the point from which several roads diverged, each, apparently, leading into a thick forest, and it was evident that we had much space yet to traverse ere we could be clear of the extensive grounds of Eglintoun.''<ref>Phipps, pages 61\u201363.</ref>\n\nService quotes a verse pertaining to the Eglinton Woods:\n{| cellpadding=10 border=\"0\" align=center\n|-\n| bgcolor=#f4f4f4|\n\nThe Guid Wee Green Folk\n\nDoon by the Lugton,<br>\nIn Eglinton Woods,<br>\nIn blue-bell and foxglove,<br>\nIn the faulded up buds,<br>\nIt's there whaur they bide,<br>\nIt's there whaur they troke,<br>\nIt's there whaur they hide -<br>\nThe guid wee green folk.<br><ref>Service, Page 181</ref>\n|}\n\nA mention in Badderley's 'Through Guide' circa 1890 indicates that the Eglinton Castle grounds were open to the public on Saturdays.<ref>Newsletter (1989), Page 8</ref>\n\n====Notable trees====\nThe 'Fauna, Flora and Geology of the Clyde Area'<ref>Scott Elliot, G.

Tree removal for sale as timber was one of the first acts of the new owners of the estate when it was sold in the late 1940s, however many had already been removed in 1925 by Neill of Prestwick and Howie of Dunlop, both being timber merchants.<ref>Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.</ref>\n\nThe significant trees were:- Holly (6' 10'' girth); Sycamore (13' 2'' girth \u2013 Deer Park); Field Maple (6' 5'' girth); Horse Chestnut (11' 4'' girth); Gean (girth 11' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Hawthorn (8' 3'' girth); Fraxinus heterophylla (4' 6'' girth \u2013 Lady Jane's Cottage); Elm (12' 7' girth \u2013 castle); Hornbeam (14' girth \u2013 between Castle & Mains); Holly Oak (5' 2'' girth \u2013 gardens); Sweet Chestnut (16' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Beech (18' 3'' girth \u2013 Old Wood); Cut-leaved Beech (8' 11'' girth); Larch (8' 9'' girth); Cedar of Lebanon (9' 11'' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Scots Pine (11' girth \u2013 between Castle and Mains).\n\n===The Eglinton Tournament===\n[[File:The Melee, Eglinton Tournament.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]] by [[James Henry Nixon]] in 1839]]\nEglinton is best remembered for the lavish, if ill-fated [[Eglinton Tournament]], a [[medieval]]-style [[tournament]] organised in 1839 by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl]]. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style torrential rain washed the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as [[jousting]]. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (the future [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napol\u00e9on III of France|Napol\u00e9on III of the French]]).<ref>Ker, Page 318</ref>\n\n===The demise of the castle===\n[[Image:Robertsonscunn2.jpg|thumb|200px|Robertson's map of the 1820s showing a lochan at Eglinton Castle.]]\nThe immense cost of upkeep, the poor condition of the castle and death duties took their toll on the family finances; the castle was abandoned in 1925. De-roofed in 1926, the lead being removed and sold,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park</ref> after a house contents sale in December 1925, and progressively ruinous, the building finally came to an undignified end during the [[Second World War]] when it was seriously damaged during [[British Army|army]] training held there. The army also partly destroyed the iron bridge running to the old walled gardens.\n[[File:Earls of Eglinton and Winton, the Setons.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Stone commemorating the Setons becoming Earls of Eglinton]]\n[[Image:Eglintoune castle west view.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Eglintoune castle from the west, prior to the rebuild of 1805.]]\nThe 1925 house sale by Dowell's Limited, included 1,960 items auctioned, raising \u00a37,004 19s 6d. The auction catalogue provides an interesting insight into the feelings of the family at this sad time, with much of the Montgomerie history sold off, such as the 13th Earl's suit of armour from the tournament, the panel from the door of the murdered 10th Earl's coach and many paintings of the family and the castle, including a portrait of that great beauty, Susanna Kennedy, Countess of Eglinton.<ref name=\"Dowells2\"/> The family moved to [[Skelmorlie Castle]] near [[Largs]] in 1925.\n\nArchitects drawings from March 1930 survive for plans to adapt the stable buildings as a residence for the Earl of Eglinton and Winton.<ref name=\"Eglinton Archive\">Eglinton Archive</ref>\n\nSubstantial remains of the castle survived WW2, however the buildings were rationalised in 1973 and only one main tower was kept, together with some outer wall, foundations and parts of the castle wings.<ref>Campbell, Page 177</ref>\n\nEglinton Castle is said by one of the gardeners to have had a room which was never opened. In about 1925 a young man from Kilwinning decided to take some of the panelling from a room in the castle as it was all being allowed to rot in the rain anyway, the roof had been removed. He went the castle to take away as much as he could carry, however one of the last pieces he selected left exposed the skeletal hand of a woman. The whole skeleton was later removed by a student doctor, but for fear of prosecution the matter was never reported to the police.<ref>Montgomeries of Eglinton, page 98.</ref>\n\n==Eglinton family micro-history==\n[[File:Sophia, Countess of Eglinton, Memorial.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Memorial to Lady Sophia Montgomerie, wife of the 14th Earl]]\n\nIn 1583 Lady Anne Montgomerie brought her husband, Lord Semple, a dowry of 6000 [[merks]], a considerable sum.<ref>Chambers, Robert (1885).

Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858\u20131923), have identified him with Hugh of Eglington, and advanced his authorship of several other significant pieces of verse.\n\n[[Viva Seton Montgomerie]] records that a gipsy put a curse on the Montgomerie family that for three generations the property would not go from father to son.<ref>Montgomerie, Page 2</ref>\n\nThe origin of the family crest is unclear, however a link may exist with the popular biblical story of an [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general of Nebuchadnezzar. The general laid siege to Bethulia, and the city almost surrendered. It was saved by Judith, a beautiful Hebrew widow who entered Holofernes's camp, seduced, and then beheaded Holofernes while he was drunk. She returned to Bethulia with Holofernes head, and the Hebrews subsequently defeated the enemy. Judith is considered as a symbol of liberty, virtue, and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause.\n\n===Eglinton Country Park===\n\n{{main|Eglinton Country Park}}\n\nIn the 1970s plans were made to open the extensive grounds (988 acres) around the ruins to the public, and to that end what remained of the structure was made safe by demolishing all but a wing facade and a single tower. Eglinton Country Park is now fully established with free entry and is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Ayrshire.\n\nEglinton Estate was in disrepair until Robert Clement Wilson purchased the grounds and built a meat canning factory in what was the old stable block. He also restored the grounds to their former splendour at his own expense.

The [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna]], wife of the 9th Earl, moved to Kilmaurs House and then to Auchans Castle for instance. Over the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,<ref name=\"Fullarton, Page 21\">Fullarton, Page 21</ref> [[Kilmaurs Place|Kilmaurs House]], [[Auchans Castle, Ayrshire|Auchans Castle]] and Redburn House were some of the dower houses used.\n\n====The Rackets Hall====\n[[File:Rackets Hall, Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Rackets Hall built by the 13th Earl.]]\nEglinton has a 'Racket Hall' which was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846.

The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the hoops 'to ring the changes' and two tunnels for the ball to pass through.

It was built at the beginning of the previous century. In the 1920s the Pavilion, two lodges, stables and walled garden in 3.4 acres of ground were sold to the Roman Catholic Church on 30 January 1924 for \u00a34500.

The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in this herd were hornless.<ref>Turner, Page 239</ref>\n\n===The Garden or Easter Chambers===\nAfter the destruction of the main buildings at [[Kilwinning Abbey]] the Garden or Easter Chambers within the boundary walls of the old abbey, previously the dwelling of the abbot were used by the new owners, the Earls of Eglinton, as a dower house and family dwelling. Lady Mary Montgomerie lived here after the death of her husband in the 17th century and her son may have remained here until he succeeded to the Earldom. The building, which stood to the south of the abbey, was eventually demolished in 1784 and the stones used in building projects at the castle, particularly the stable offices.<ref name=\"Fullarton, Page 21\"/> The 1691 Hearth Tax records show that this substantial building had 15 hearths.<ref name=\"Urquhart, Page 92\"/>\n\n===Daft Will Speirs===\nA well known Ayrshire eccentric, Will had been a high spirited youth, punished by being hung over the edge of a bridge over the River Garnock whilst it was in flood, resulting in a form of nervous breakdown which left him as a likeable character, accepted by most and a regular visitor to many a laird or earl's estates. Will died at Corsehillmuir whilst going from Bannoch to Moncur, falling into an old mine shaft whilst trying to rescue a collie dog.<ref>Service, Pages 42 - 43</ref>\n\n===The Buffalo Park===\nAn area below the old Mains Farm was known as the 'Buffalo Park' and this may relate to the 11th Earl having been involved in the British army's subjugation of the [[Cherokee]] Indians in North America.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===The Irish Giant===\nJohn Service relates an Ayrshire legend that an Irish Giant came to mock the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith who lived near [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]] and the laird chased him across to Eglinton where the giant went to crush him with a great beech tree. The laird pierced him through the arm bones with his sword and the giants hand remained attached to the tree for centuries. It could be seen from a distance of about a mile - from Kilwinning, between Dykehead and the Redburn.<ref>Service, page 105</ref>\n\n===Vagrants and the unemployed===\nIn 1662 the Earl was given the rights to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to [[Montgomerieston]] at the Citadel of Ayr where the Earl had a wool factory. The parishes had to support them whilst there and the Earl only had to provide food and clothing. The rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed.<ref>Lauchland, Page 27</ref>\n\n===The National Covenant===\nA painting by W.

This bloodsport finally became illegal in Scotland in 2002. A famous greyhound owned by Lord Eglinton was named 'Heather Jock' after a colourful local character of that name.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the 1622 persecution the minister of Irvine, Mr David Duckson, was banished, however the earl had him returned to his charge. [[Anne Livingstone|Anne, Countess of Eglinton]], daughter of [[Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow]], was very religious, and Eglinton was a safe haven for persecuted ministers.

S. Wilson travelled to the castle on Sunday afternoons to conduct services. The earl granted a piece of land in Ardrossan with a nominal feu duty to the church and his countess laid the church foundation stone on 30 November 1874; it opened in 1875 and consecrated in 1882 by Bishop Wilson.<ref>Shaw, 128</ref>\n\n===Farms===\nAiton in 1811 records that nearly all the farms on the extensive estates of the 10th Earl of Eglinton were ''elegant, commodious, and substantial.''<ref>Aiton, Page 118</ref>\n\n===Montgomerystown===\nAyr citadel, later called the Fort, was constructed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 with stones taken from the Earl's castle at Ardrossan. It occupied an area of about 12 acres, on a hexagonal ground plan, with bastions at the angles, and enclosed the church of St John the Baptist, converted by Cromwell into an armoury and guard-room. After Cromwell's time it was dismantled and the ground it occupied, together with its buildings, presented to the Earl of Eglinton as compensation for losses sustained during the Great Rebellion. Renamed [[Montgomerieston|Montgomerystown]], it was created a burgh of regality, and became the seat of a considerable trade, including a family owned brewery. In 1726 it was purchased by four merchants from the town, and circa 1870, most of it covered with high quality housing.<ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory478.html Gazetteer for Scotland] Retrieved: 2011-02-18</ref>\n\n===Early automobile accident===\nIn 1911, a motor van belonging to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out and two of them were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the injured parties taken to Beith in his car.

The 13th earl gave the couple a life-rent interest in the mansion house of Rozelle. The estate of Rozelle (formerly Rosel) had been part of the lands of the Barony of Alloway. The future estate was purchased by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, his uncle, a former Jamaica merchant who named it after a Jamaican property and also built the mansion house (1760). Archibald Hamilton rebuilt the house in the 1830s to designs by the architect David Bryce and in 1837 he purchased the Rozelle estate.<ref>[http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&st=1& SCRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224917/http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&st=1& |date=2011-10-03 }} Retrieved: 2011-08-21</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Eglinton Country Park]]\n* [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]]\n* [[Eglinton Tournament Bridge]]\n* [[Robert Burns and the Eglinton Estate]]\n* [[Eglinton Avenue]]\n* [[Drukken Steps]]\n* [[Lands of Lainshaw]]\n* [[Lands of Doura]]\n* [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton]]\n* [[Seagate Castle]]\n* [[Barony and Castle of Corsehill]]\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n;Sources\n{{refbegin|2}}\n# Aiton, William (1811).

It is noted that the earl had not paid the tax. The earl's house in Kilwinning, Easter Chambers or the old abbot's dwelling, had 15 hearths. Thirty-seven other dwellings were listed within the barony of Eglinton.<ref name=\"Urquhart, Page 92\">Urquhart, Page 92</ref>\n\nThe stables were built from stones taken from the Easter Chambers of Kilwinning Abbey; being the Abbots lodgings and later that of the Earls of Eglinton. In 1784, over a period of four months, the building was demolished and the stones were taken to Eglinton.<ref>Service, Page 140</ref>\n\nThe construction of the new castle was not universally accepted as beneficial; Fullarton records that \"The hoary grandeur of the old fortalice lay deeply buried amid the dense groves of immemorial growth which closely invested and obscured it; no innovating projects of improvement, nor change of any kind, had ever been permitted to disturb the sanctity of its seclusion, or to ruffle the feelings even of the most fastiduous worshipper of things as they are, or, more properly perhaps, chance to be\".<ref>Fullarton, Page 85</ref> The castle is said to have had a moat.<ref>Anstruther, Page 27</ref>\n\n====Covenating times====\nIn the 1640s [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] had been sent by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Neil Montgomery of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] negotiated a 4,000 merks penalty for the Eglinton Estates; three tenants having already been killed, with some deer and sheep also taken from the park.<ref>Stevenson, David (1994).

No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries which does exist under the old abbey.<ref>Service, page 48.</ref> A ley or an escape tunnel is also said to run from the castle to exit at the old waterfall near the rockery. It is reported that a tunnel ran from the castle to near the existing Castle Bridge. This tunnel was stone lined and tall enough for a man to walk through. This is likely to have been the main drain from the castle.\n\n===The Pleasure gardens===\n\n[[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1636 describes the landscape on his journey south from Glasgow as \"a barren and poor country\", but the earls had clearly enhanced Eglinton for he comments that the land at Irvine was \"dainty, pleasant, level, champaign country.\"<ref>Brereton</ref>\n[[File:Eglinton Temple, Kilwinning, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Temple which the Countess of Eglinton had proposed for the Belvidere Hill.]]\n\nThe grounds of the castle were described in one record of the 1840s as follows:\n\n''Its princely gates soon presented themselves and we thought we should easily find our way to Irvine through the park. It was a rich treat to wander in these extensive grounds. We soon made way through a handsome avenue to the gardens. The hot-houses for fruits and flowers are on a magnificent scale, and on reaching the parterre we were delighted with the elegance which pervaded it. A glassy river with a silvery cascade came gliding gently through these fairy regions, as though conscious of the luxuriant paradise which it was watering. Nor was the classic taste wanting, nor horticultural skill, to render this a region of enchantment. Two elegant cast-iron bridges, vases, statues, a sun-dial; these pretty combinations from the world of art could not fail to please the beholder. Leaving these luxurious regions we again wandered among thick woods, and occasionally obtained glimpses of the proud castle, peering over the trees. At length we found our way to a seat beneath some noble weepers of the ash tribe, and here we had a fine view of the castle, towering majestically over the dense foliage.''\n[[File:Map of Dunduff castle & roads.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Ayrshire by William Aiton, 1811]]\n''Among our wanderings we passed an enormous quadrangular building, resembling some of our London hospitals. It forms the stables, and it is quite detached, at some distance from the Castle. We mistook our way, owing to the many devious paths, and wandered deeper and deeper into the recesses of this extensive domain. In passing through one long avenue, which was so dark that we were unable to see our steps; myriads of rooks took flight at our approach, and the air was quite blackened with them. At one time, we found ourselves walking alongside of the preserves, at another we were wandering in the deer park, and startling the early slumbers of these pretty creatures. At length we reached a gate, which we fully expected would lead into the high road to Irvine: but, to our great consternation, we found it was the point from which several roads diverged, each, apparently, leading into a thick forest, and it was evident that we had much space yet to traverse ere we could be clear of the extensive grounds of Eglintoun.''<ref>Phipps, pages 61\u201363.</ref>\n\nService quotes a verse pertaining to the Eglinton Woods:\n{| cellpadding=10 border=\"0\" align=center\n|-\n| bgcolor=#f4f4f4|\n\nThe Guid Wee Green Folk\n\nDoon by the Lugton,<br>\nIn Eglinton Woods,<br>\nIn blue-bell and foxglove,<br>\nIn the faulded up buds,<br>\nIt's there whaur they bide,<br>\nIt's there whaur they troke,<br>\nIt's there whaur they hide -<br>\nThe guid wee green folk.<br><ref>Service, Page 181</ref>\n|}\n\nA mention in Badderley's 'Through Guide' circa 1890 indicates that the Eglinton Castle grounds were open to the public on Saturdays.<ref>Newsletter (1989), Page 8</ref>\n\n====Notable trees====\nThe 'Fauna, Flora and Geology of the Clyde Area'<ref>Scott Elliot, G.

Tree removal for sale as timber was one of the first acts of the new owners of the estate when it was sold in the late 1940s, however many had already been removed in 1925 by Neill of Prestwick and Howie of Dunlop, both being timber merchants.<ref>Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.</ref>\n\nThe significant trees were:- Holly (6' 10'' girth); Sycamore (13' 2'' girth \u2013 Deer Park); Field Maple (6' 5'' girth); Horse Chestnut (11' 4'' girth); Gean (girth 11' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Hawthorn (8' 3'' girth); Fraxinus heterophylla (4' 6'' girth \u2013 Lady Jane's Cottage); Elm (12' 7' girth \u2013 castle); Hornbeam (14' girth \u2013 between Castle & Mains); Holly Oak (5' 2'' girth \u2013 gardens); Sweet Chestnut (16' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Beech (18' 3'' girth \u2013 Old Wood); Cut-leaved Beech (8' 11'' girth); Larch (8' 9'' girth); Cedar of Lebanon (9' 11'' girth \u2013 Bullock Park); Scots Pine (11' girth \u2013 between Castle and Mains).\n\n===The Eglinton Tournament===\n[[File:The Melee, Eglinton Tournament.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]] by [[James Henry Nixon]] in 1839]]\nEglinton is best remembered for the lavish, if ill-fated [[Eglinton Tournament]], a [[medieval]]-style [[tournament]] organised in 1839 by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl]]. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style torrential rain washed the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as [[jousting]]. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (the future [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napol\u00e9on III of France|Napol\u00e9on III of the French]]).<ref>Ker, Page 318</ref>\n\n===The demise of the castle===\n[[Image:Robertsonscunn2.jpg|thumb|200px|Robertson's map of the 1820s showing a lochan at Eglinton Castle.]]\nThe immense cost of upkeep, the poor condition of the castle and death duties took their toll on the family finances; the castle was abandoned in 1925. De-roofed in 1926, the lead being removed and sold,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park</ref> after a house contents sale in December 1925, and progressively ruinous, the building finally came to an undignified end during the [[Second World War]] when it was seriously damaged during [[British Army|army]] training held there. The army also partly destroyed the iron bridge running to the old walled gardens.\n[[File:Earls of Eglinton and Winton, the Setons.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Stone commemorating the Setons becoming Earls of Eglinton]]\n[[Image:Eglintoune castle west view.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Eglintoune castle from the west, prior to the rebuild of 1805.]]\nThe 1925 house sale by Dowell's Limited, included 1,960 items auctioned, raising \u00a37,004 19s 6d. The auction catalogue provides an interesting insight into the feelings of the family at this sad time, with much of the Montgomerie history sold off, such as the 13th Earl's suit of armour from the tournament, the panel from the door of the murdered 10th Earl's coach and many paintings of the family and the castle, including a portrait of that great beauty, Susanna Kennedy, Countess of Eglinton.<ref name=\"Dowells2\"/> The family moved to [[Skelmorlie Castle]] near [[Largs]] in 1925.\n\nArchitects drawings from March 1930 survive for plans to adapt the stable buildings as a residence for the Earl of Eglinton and Winton.<ref name=\"Eglinton Archive\">Eglinton Archive</ref>\n\nSubstantial remains of the castle survived WW2, however the buildings were rationalised in 1973 and only one main tower was kept, together with some outer wall, foundations and parts of the castle wings.<ref>Campbell, Page 177</ref>\n\nEglinton Castle is said by one of the gardeners to have had a room which was never opened. In about 1925 a young man from Kilwinning decided to take some of the panelling from a room in the castle as it was all being allowed to rot in the rain anyway, the roof had been removed. He went the castle to take away as much as he could carry, however one of the last pieces he selected left exposed the skeletal hand of a woman. The whole skeleton was later removed by a student doctor, but for fear of prosecution the matter was never reported to the police.<ref>Montgomeries of Eglinton, page 98.</ref>\n\n==Eglinton family micro-history==\n[[File:Sophia, Countess of Eglinton, Memorial.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Memorial to Lady Sophia Montgomerie, wife of the 14th Earl]]\n\nIn 1583 Lady Anne Montgomerie brought her husband, Lord Semple, a dowry of 6000 [[merks]], a considerable sum.<ref>Chambers, Robert (1885).

Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858\u20131923), have identified him with Hugh of Eglington, and advanced his authorship of several other significant pieces of verse.\n\n[[Viva Seton Montgomerie]] records that a gipsy put a curse on the Montgomerie family that for three generations the property would not go from father to son.<ref>Montgomerie, Page 2</ref>\n\nThe origin of the family crest is unclear, however a link may exist with the popular biblical story of an [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general of Nebuchadnezzar. The general laid siege to Bethulia, and the city almost surrendered. It was saved by Judith, a beautiful Hebrew widow who entered Holofernes's camp, seduced, and then beheaded Holofernes while he was drunk. She returned to Bethulia with Holofernes head, and the Hebrews subsequently defeated the enemy. Judith is considered as a symbol of liberty, virtue, and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause.\n\n===Eglinton Country Park===\n\n{{main|Eglinton Country Park}}\n\nIn the 1970s plans were made to open the extensive grounds (988 acres) around the ruins to the public, and to that end what remained of the structure was made safe by demolishing all but a wing facade and a single tower. Eglinton Country Park is now fully established with free entry and is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Ayrshire.\n\nEglinton Estate was in disrepair until Robert Clement Wilson purchased the grounds and built a meat canning factory in what was the old stable block. He also restored the grounds to their former splendour at his own expense. The canning factory closed following the BSE crises in 1996.\n\nIn 1963 [[Ian Anstruther]] wrote an entertaining account of the 1839 tournament entitled ''The Knight and the Umbrella''.\n\n;Views of Eglinton Castle in 2007\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Eglintoncastle1.JPG|The remaining tower from the Lugton Water ford side\nImage:Eglintoncastle4.JPG|The ruins from the Tournament Bridge side\nImage:Eglintoncastle5.JPG|The tower and the remaining side wall\nImage:Montgomerycrest1.JPG|The Montgomerie family crest on the castle ruins\nImage:Eglintontournamentbridge.JPG|Eglinton Tournament Bridge\nImage:EflintonOfficescrest.JPG|The Montgomerie family crest on the offices/stables/coach house\nImage:Eglintonoffices.JPG|The offices, coach house and old stables\n</gallery>\n\n==The castle and estate prior to the establishment of the country park==\n\n===The intact castle \u2013 exterior===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Eglinton Castle 1811 001.jpg|Eglinton Castle, north side, 1811\nImage:Eglinton 1802.JPG|Eglinton castle in 1802\nFile:Eglinton Castle by J Fleming.jpg|Eglinton Castle circa 1830\nImage:Eglinton castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|The castle and gardens\nImage:Eglinton castle Ayrshire 1880.jpg|Eglinton circa 1880\nFile:Eglinton Castle in 1930s.jpg|The Castle circa 1900\nImage:Eglinton Castle, Irvine, circa 1870.jpg|The castle circa 1870, with deer grazing in the foreground\nFile:Eglinton Castle, Irvine, 1906.jpg|Eglinton Castle in 1906\nImage:Eglinton Castle Irvine.jpg|The castle in its prime\nImage:Eglinton Castle from the Deerpark.jpg|The castle from the deerpark in the 19th century\nImage:Eglinton castle (old) colour.jpg|Eglinton castle\nImage:Eglinton castle 1910.jpg|The castle in 1910<ref name=\"Harvey\">Harvey, William (1910), ''Picturesque Ayrshire.''

The [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna]], wife of the 9th Earl, moved to Kilmaurs House and then to Auchans Castle for instance. Over the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,<ref name=\"Fullarton, Page 21\">Fullarton, Page 21</ref> [[Kilmaurs Place|Kilmaurs House]], [[Auchans Castle, Ayrshire|Auchans Castle]] and Redburn House were some of the dower houses used.\n\n====The Rackets Hall====\n[[File:Rackets Hall, Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Rackets Hall built by the 13th Earl.]]\nEglinton has a 'Racket Hall' which was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The court floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racquet court, built before the court size was standardised and is now the oldest surviving court in the World, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland.<ref name=\"Archive\">Eglinton Country Park archive</ref> In 1860 the earl employed a rackets professional, John Mitchell and Patrick Devitt replaced him.

Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park</ref>\n\n====Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet====\nA croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between the castle and the Lugton Water, also the old site of the marquee for the tournament banquet. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the hoops 'to ring the changes' and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist.

She measured 219 feet long, extreme breadth 37 feet, depth 22 feet, registered tonnage 1,235, builders measurements 1,461 tons. Lady Egidia was the daughter of the Earl of Eglinton.

It was built at the beginning of the previous century. In the 1920s the Pavilion, two lodges, stables and walled garden in 3.4 acres of ground were sold to the Roman Catholic Church on 30 January 1924 for \u00a34500. The pavilion was demolished and the present day church and manse built on the site.<ref>[http://www.saintpeterinchains.net/ St Peter in Chains] Retrieved: 2010-11-18</ref>\n\n===White or Chillingham Cattle===\nIn 1759 the Earl of Eglinton formed a herd of the ancient breed of White or [[Chillingham Cattle]] at [[Ardrossan]], probably using stock from the [[Cadzow Castle|Cadzow herd]]. The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in this herd were hornless.<ref>Turner, Page 239</ref>\n\n===The Garden or Easter Chambers===\nAfter the destruction of the main buildings at [[Kilwinning Abbey]] the Garden or Easter Chambers within the boundary walls of the old abbey, previously the dwelling of the abbot were used by the new owners, the Earls of Eglinton, as a dower house and family dwelling. Lady Mary Montgomerie lived here after the death of her husband in the 17th century and her son may have remained here until he succeeded to the Earldom. The building, which stood to the south of the abbey, was eventually demolished in 1784 and the stones used in building projects at the castle, particularly the stable offices.<ref name=\"Fullarton, Page 21\"/> The 1691 Hearth Tax records show that this substantial building had 15 hearths.<ref name=\"Urquhart, Page 92\"/>\n\n===Daft Will Speirs===\nA well known Ayrshire eccentric, Will had been a high spirited youth, punished by being hung over the edge of a bridge over the River Garnock whilst it was in flood, resulting in a form of nervous breakdown which left him as a likeable character, accepted by most and a regular visitor to many a laird or earl's estates. Will died at Corsehillmuir whilst going from Bannoch to Moncur, falling into an old mine shaft whilst trying to rescue a collie dog.<ref>Service, Pages 42 - 43</ref>\n\n===The Buffalo Park===\nAn area below the old Mains Farm was known as the 'Buffalo Park' and this may relate to the 11th Earl having been involved in the British army's subjugation of the [[Cherokee]] Indians in North America.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===The Irish Giant===\nJohn Service relates an Ayrshire legend that an Irish Giant came to mock the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith who lived near [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]] and the laird chased him across to Eglinton where the giant went to crush him with a great beech tree. The laird pierced him through the arm bones with his sword and the giants hand remained attached to the tree for centuries. It could be seen from a distance of about a mile - from Kilwinning, between Dykehead and the Redburn.<ref>Service, page 105</ref>\n\n===Vagrants and the unemployed===\nIn 1662 the Earl was given the rights to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to [[Montgomerieston]] at the Citadel of Ayr where the Earl had a wool factory. The parishes had to support them whilst there and the Earl only had to provide food and clothing. The rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed.<ref>Lauchland, Page 27</ref>\n\n===The National Covenant===\nA painting by W. Hole RSA of the 1638 ''Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Churchyard'' features the Earl of Eglinton in the crowd, just prior to his putting his signature to the document.\n\n===Lady Jane's Cottage===\nA similar style of cottage existed at Kidsneuk and on the [[Crosbie Castle and the Fullarton estate|Fullarton estate]] in [[Troon]] as a lodge house near the Crosbie Kirk ruins.<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-115-409-C Heather House, Troon.

This bloodsport finally became illegal in Scotland in 2002. A famous greyhound owned by Lord Eglinton was named 'Heather Jock' after a colourful local character of that name.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the 1622 persecution the minister of Irvine, Mr David Duckson, was banished, however the earl had him returned to his charge. [[Anne Livingstone|Anne, Countess of Eglinton]], daughter of [[Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow]], was very religious, and Eglinton was a safe haven for persecuted ministers. She took an interest in the [[Stewarton|Stewarton Revival]] and invited some of the adherents to meet the earl and the castle.<ref>Buchan, Page 19</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century the Montgomerie's of Eglinton were supporters of the Scottish Episcopalian church and the Rev W. S. Wilson travelled to the castle on Sunday afternoons to conduct services. The earl granted a piece of land in Ardrossan with a nominal feu duty to the church and his countess laid the church foundation stone on 30 November 1874; it opened in 1875 and consecrated in 1882 by Bishop Wilson.<ref>Shaw, 128</ref>\n\n===Farms===\nAiton in 1811 records that nearly all the farms on the extensive estates of the 10th Earl of Eglinton were ''elegant, commodious, and substantial.''<ref>Aiton, Page 118</ref>\n\n===Montgomerystown===\nAyr citadel, later called the Fort, was constructed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 with stones taken from the Earl's castle at Ardrossan. It occupied an area of about 12 acres, on a hexagonal ground plan, with bastions at the angles, and enclosed the church of St John the Baptist, converted by Cromwell into an armoury and guard-room. After Cromwell's time it was dismantled and the ground it occupied, together with its buildings, presented to the Earl of Eglinton as compensation for losses sustained during the Great Rebellion. Renamed [[Montgomerieston|Montgomerystown]], it was created a burgh of regality, and became the seat of a considerable trade, including a family owned brewery. In 1726 it was purchased by four merchants from the town, and circa 1870, most of it covered with high quality housing.<ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory478.html Gazetteer for Scotland] Retrieved: 2011-02-18</ref>\n\n===Early automobile accident===\nIn 1911, a motor van belonging to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out and two of them were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the injured parties taken to Beith in his car.

The 13th earl gave the couple a life-rent interest in the mansion house of Rozelle. The estate of Rozelle (formerly Rosel) had been part of the lands of the Barony of Alloway. The future estate was purchased by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, his uncle, a former Jamaica merchant who named it after a Jamaican property and also built the mansion house (1760). Archibald Hamilton rebuilt the house in the 1830s to designs by the architect David Bryce and in 1837 he purchased the Rozelle estate.<ref>[http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&st=1& SCRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224917/http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&st=1& |date=2011-10-03 }} Retrieved: 2011-08-21</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Eglinton Country Park]]\n* [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]]\n* [[Eglinton Tournament Bridge]]\n* [[Robert Burns and the Eglinton Estate]]\n* [[Eglinton Avenue]]\n* [[Drukken Steps]]\n* [[Lands of Lainshaw]]\n* [[Lands of Doura]]\n* [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton]]\n* [[Seagate Castle]]\n* [[Barony and Castle of Corsehill]]\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n;Sources\n{{refbegin|2}}\n# Aiton, William (1811).
