Then, deeper lags of the dependent variable are used as instruments for differenced lags of the dependent variable (which are endogenous).\n\nIn traditional panel data techniques, adding deeper lags of the dependent variable reduces the number of observations available. For example, if observations are available at T time periods, then after first differencing, only T-1 lags are usable. Then, if K lags of the dependent variable are used as instruments, only T-K-1 observations are usable in the regression. This creates a trade-off: adding more lags provides more instruments, but reduces the sample size. The Arellano\u2013Bond method circumvents this problem.\n\n==Formal description==\nConsider the static linear unobserved effects model for <math>N</math> observations and <math>T</math> time periods:\n:<math>y_{it} = X_{it}\\mathbf{\\beta}+\\alpha_i+u_{it}</math> for <math>t=1,\\ldots,T</math> and <math>i=1,\\ldots,N</math>\nwhere <math>y_{it}</math> is the dependent variable observed for individual <math>i</math> at time\n<math>t,</math> <math>X_{it}</math> is the time-variant <math>1\\times k</math> regressor matrix, <math>\\alpha_i</math> is the unobserved time-invariant individual effect and <math>u_{it}</math> is the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error term]]. Unlike <math>X_{it}</math>, <math>\\alpha_i</math> cannot be observed by the econometrician. Common examples for time-invariant effects <math>\\alpha_i</math> are innate ability for individuals or historical and institutional factors for countries.\n\nUnlike a static panel data model, a dynamic panel model also contains lags of the dependent variable as regressors, accounting for concepts such as momentum and inertia. In addition to the regressors outlined above, consider a case where one lag of the dependent variable is included as a regressor, <math>y_{it-1}</math>.\n\n:<math>y_{it} = X_{it}\\mathbf{\\beta}+\\rho y_{it-1}+\\alpha_{i}+u_{it} \\text{ for } t=1,\\ldots,T \\text{ and } i=1,\\ldots,N</math>\n\nTaking the first difference of this equation to eliminate the fixed effect,\n\n:<math>\\Delta y_{it}=y_{it}-y_{it-1}=\\Delta X_{it}\\beta + \\rho\\Delta\\,y_{it-1} + \\Delta u_{it} \\text{ for } t=1,\\ldots,T \\text{ and } i=1,\\ldots,N.</math>\n\nThis equation can be re-written as,\n\n:<math>\\Delta y=\\Delta R \\pi +\\Delta u.</math>\n\nApplying the formula for the Efficient Generalized Method of Moments Estimator, which is,\n\n:<math> \\pi_\\text{EGMM} = [\\Delta R'Z(Z'\\Omega Z)^{-1}Z'\\,\\Delta R]^{-1}\\,\\Delta R'Z(Z'\\Omega Z)^{-1}Z'\\Delta y</math>\n\nwhere <math>Z</math> is the instrument matrix for <math>\\Delta R</math>.\n\nThe matrix <math>\\Omega</math> can be calculated from the variance of the error terms, <math>u_{it}</math> for the one-step Arellano\u2013Bond estimator or using the residual vectors of the one-step Arellano\u2013Bond estimator for the two-step Arellano\u2013Bond estimator, which is [[Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors|consistent and asymptotically efficient in the presence of heteroskedasticity]].\n\n==Instrument matrix==\n\nThe original Anderson and Hsiao (1981) IV estimator uses the following moment conditions:\n:<math>E(y_{it-I} \\, \\Delta u_{it}) = 0 \\text{ with } I\\ge 2 \\text{ for each } t\\ge 3. </math>\n\nUsing the single instrument <math>y_{it-2} </math>, these moment conditions form the basis for the instrument matrix <math> Z_{di} </math>:\n\n:<math> Z_{di} = \\begin{bmatrix}NA & (t=2) \\\\y_{i1} & (t=3) \\\\y_{i2} & (t=4) \\\\\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\y_{T-2} & (t=T) \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\n'''Note:''' ''The first possible observation is t = 2 due to the first difference transformation''\n\nThe instrument <math>y_{it-2} </math> enters as a single column. Since <math>y_{it-2} </math> is unavailable at <math>t=2 </math>, all observations from <math>t=2 </math> must be dropped.\n\nUsing an additional instrument <math>y_{it-3} </math> would mean adding an additional column to <math> Z_{di} </math>. Thus, all observations from <math>t=3 </math> would have to be dropped.\n\nWhile adding additional instruments increases the efficiency of the IV estimator, the smaller sample size decreases efficiency. This is the efficiency - sample size trade-off.\n\nThe Arellano-bond estimator addresses this trade-off by using time-specific instruments.\n\nThe Arellano\u2013Bond estimator uses the following moment conditions\n\n:<math>E(y_{it-I} \\, \\Delta u_{it}) = 0 \\text{ for } t\\ge 3,\\,I\\ge 2. </math>\n\nUsing these moment conditions, the instrument matrix <math> Z_{di} </math> now becomes:\n\n:<math> Z_{di} = \\begin{bmatrix}y_{i1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\0 & y_{i2} & y_{i1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & y_{i3} & y_{i2} & y_{i1} & \\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nNote that the number of moments is increasing in the time period: this is how the efficiency - sample size tradeoff is avoided. Time periods further in the future have more lags available to use as instruments.\n\nThen if one defines:\n\n:<math> \\Delta u_i = \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta u_{i3} \\\\ \\Delta u_{i4}\\\\ \\Delta u_{i5} \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nThe moment conditions can be summarized as:\n\n:<math>E(Z_{di}^T \\, \\Delta u_i) = 0 </math>\n\nThese moment conditions are only valid when the error term <math>u_{it}</math> has no serial correlation. If serial correlation is present, then the Arellano\u2013Bond estimator can still be used under some circumstances, but deeper lags will be required. For example, if the error term <math>u_{it}</math> is correlated with all terms <math>u_{it-s}</math> for s<math>\\leq</math>S (as would be the case if <math>u_{it}</math> were a MA(S) process), it would be necessary to use only lags of <math>y_{it}</math> of depth S + 1 or greater as instruments.\n\n==Systems GMM==\n\nWhen the variance of the fixed effect term across individual observations is high, or when the stochastic process <math>y_{it}</math> is close to being a [[random walk]], then the Arellano\u2013Bond estimator may perform very poorly in finite samples.

Many members came and went as the band found their footing in the growing punk rock scene in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe first solid formation of the band came together in 1995 when the two founder members (guitarist Jon Burlinson and vocalist Mads) recruited 15-year-old drummer Pete Jennings to replace James Hester (now drumming in UK band Malaki). After the departure of bassist Mike Britton (of P4FT) the band hired a young Bassist from [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], Daryl Barrett-Cross. The band spent almost a year away from the public before debuting the new line-up, new songs and style at The Full Moon pub in Bristol.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1997, after gaining a strong following in [[Bristol]] and the surrounding area, the band recorded two demo cassettes at the Blue Room Studio in Bristol, \"Two Way Family Favourites\" and \"Cheggers Plays Punk\". The band got the attention of 21-year-old Greg Pearson (Greg Elk), who was starting his own label \"Pigman Records\", who agreed to put out an EP for the band.\n\n=== 1998\u20131999 ===\n\nIn 1998 with the breakup of his own band Yellowskin the band asked Greg to join Mr.Zippy as a 2nd guitarist. He did and with more money to put into Mr.Zippy the band once again entered the Blue Room Studio in [[Bristol]] to record their debut album \"What You Are Like Says A Lot About The Kind Of Person You Are\" which was released in 1999.\n\nThe band started to set sight their sights out of the local area and played around the UK gaining a large following in the UK punk underground and playing with such bands as [[Mustard Plug]], [[No comply]], Spiderplug (Later [[Adequate 7]]), [[Lightyear (band)]], [[Five Knuckle]], [[Big D & The Kids Table]], [[King Prawn (band)|King Prawn]], [[Capdown]] and formed a growing friendship with the band [[4ft Fingers]].\n\nThe band also scored some stranger support slots playing with such bands as Somerset legends [[The Wurzels]], Alex Kane's AntiProduct and Skiffle band Dynamo Rhythm Aces.\n\n=== 2000\u20132001 ===\n\nIn 2000, the band booked their first UK tour with Japanese thrash band Displaced Person, gaining a growing UK following. The band also started to appear on compilation albums worldwide.\n\nIn 2001 they entered the Whitehouse Studios in Weston-Super-Mare to record the \"Another Weekend\" 7\" which was limited to only 100 copies and hand-numbered. It was around this time that they earned the attention of [[Golf Records]] who offered to distribute the band's EP and album via Plastic Head Distribution. As luck had it Golf thought more of the band over time and when the band's debut album sold out, Golf signed the band up for a three-album deal, offering to re-release the debut album first.\n\nIn the summer of 2001 the band underwent a self-organised tour of [[Japan]]. Although the tour was a great success it did bring to the band's attention their growing displeasure with bassist Daryl Barrett-Cross who was fired from the band on their return to the UK. Daryl went on to form the gore-metal band Amputated.\n\n== 2002\u20132003 ==\n\nThe band continued to gig, headling many shows or playing with such bands as [[Snuff (band)|Snuff]], [[Consumed (band)|Consumed]], [[King Prawn (band)|King Prawn]], [[MU330]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThey had the help of temporary bassists Stef Snowdon and Hambis DeLaney before enlisting Mark \"Frank\" Francis into the band, previously of the band The Merics who were a favourite of [[BBC Radio One]] DJ, [[John Peel]].\n\nFrank was to play two small shows with the band before they embarked on a tour of [[Norway]] with Norwegian bands Late98 and Shitzoo.\n\nThe album \"What You Are Like Says A Lot About The Kind Of Person You Are\" came out on [[Golf Records]] while the band were away. Released with a new cover and including the three tracks from the \"Another Weekend\" 7\" and one previously unreleased track entitled \"Here We Go Again\".\n\nMore touring followed and the band hooked up with Manager John Sheller, whose previous skills had seen him managing the UK rock band [[FM (British band)]] on a tour with [[Bon Jovi]]. The relationship, however, was short-lived.\n\n[[BBC Radio One]] show ''The Lock Up'' played the band a lot, which was great support. The TV channels [[P-Rock]] and Scuzz TV were playing a lot of the band's friends at the time (notably friends Whitmore and [[4ft Fingers]]) yet Mr.Zippy chose to abstain from making a video to appear on the channels.\n\nThe band entered Mighty Atom studios ([[Mighty Atom Records]]) in 2002 to record their 2nd album \"Ambition Is Critical\". During the recording, they were visited by a young [[Funeral For A Friend]] who were just recording their first demo.\n\nAt the start of 2003, the band joined forces with Crucial Talent Booking and underwent a mammoth 3-month tour of the UK with friends [[4ft Fingers]]. The 2nd album Ambition Is Critical came out once again while the band was away on tour.\n\nOn returning the band was flooded with offers of future tours. With friend's Gash, label mates [[Tuuli (singer)|Tuuli]] and even a planned tour with (the then unknown in the UK but friends with the band) [[Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal|Bumblefoot]].\n\nSadly, singer Mads broke his ankle in a [[BMX]] accident and was unable to undergo any of the planned tours.\n\nThe band took a hiatus until September 2003 when they hit the road again with friends Caffeine for the last tour the band has undergone to date.\n\nGuitarist Greg Pearson left the band after this tour to move to [[Sweden]] and pursue new projects. He was replaced with Guitarist Andy Baker in November 2003, and the band started to write new material with a slightly new direction, putting together an album and ep's worth of new songs.\n\n== 2004\u2013present ==\n\nAlthough no longer with the support of [[Golf Records]] The band continued to gig as before, gaining high-profile support slots such as playing with [[Citizen Fish]], [[Satanic Surfers]], and [[Ten Foot Pole]].\n\n2010 saw the release of the book \"Second Place Heroes\" which is a history of the band from 1997 through to 2003 via the eyes of ex-guitarist Greg Pearson.\n\n2010 also saw the departure of Guitarist Andy Baker, to spend more time working with his main project New Riot (Ex-Fandangle). Mr Zippy continue as a 4-piece band, playing gigs and writing new material.\n\nIn 2016, former guitarist Greg C Pearson died in Poole, Dorset, aged 41.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Style==\nDrawing on their influences ranging from [[Satanic Surfers]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Ramones]], [[SNFU]], [[Faith No More]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Samiam]].

The town recorded a population of 50,380 in 2012, making it the most populous locality in Fife and the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|11th most populous in Scotland]].\n\nThe earliest known settlements in the area around Dunfermline probably date as far back as the [[Neolithic]] period. The area was not regionally significant until at least the [[Bronze Age]]. The town was first recorded in the 11th century, with the marriage of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], King of Scots, and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret]] at the church in Dunfermline. As his [[List of Scottish consorts|Queen consort]], Margaret established a new church dedicated to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], which evolved into an [[Dunfermline Abbey|Abbey]] under their son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1128. During the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]], the church - later to be known as Dunfermline Abbey - was firmly established as a prosperous royal mausoleum for the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish Crown]]. A total of eighteen royals, including seven Kings, were buried here from Queen Margaret in 1093 to [[Robert, Duke of Albany|Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in 1420. [[Robert The Bruce]], otherwise known as Robert I, became the last of the seven Scottish Kings to be buried in 1329. His bones would eventually be re-discovered and re-buried in 1821, when the excavation of the grounds of what had formerly been the eastern section of the Abbey became the site for the new Abbey Church.\n\nThe town is a major service centre for west Fife. Dunfermline retains much of its historic significance, as well as providing facilities for leisure. Employment is focused in the service sector, with the largest employer being [[Sky UK]]. Other large employers in the area include [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (on-line retailer), [[Best Western]] (hotels), CR Smith (windows manufacturing), [[FMC Technologies]] (offshore energy), [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] (both financial services).<ref name=\"Dunfermline Economy Presentation p.4\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Dunfermline}}\n[[File:Malcolm Canmore's Tower, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of Malcolm Canmore's Tower]]\nThere have been various interpretations of the name, ''\"Dunfermline\"''.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\">Dennison and Stronach, ''Historic Dunfermline'', pp.3\u20134.</ref> The first element, ''\"dun\"'' translated from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], has been accepted as a (fortified) hill, and is assumed to be referring to the rocky outcrop at the site of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]]'s tower in Pittencrieff Glen (now [[Pittencrieff Park]]).<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\">Taylor and M\u00e1rkus, ''The Place\u2013Names of Fife: Volume One'', pp.309\u2013310.</ref> The rest of the name is problematic.<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" /> The second element, ''\"the ferm\"'' may have been an alternative name for the Tower Burn according to a medieval record published in 1455 which, together with the Lyne Burn to the south, suggests the site of a fortification between these two watercourses.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\" /><ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" />\n\nThe first record of a settlement in the Dunfermline area was in the [[Neolithic]] period.

As the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] gathered pace the demand for [[Agricultural lime|lime]] (for improving land) increased the requirement for coal to burn it. Salt panning too required coal in large quantities, and the early outcrops near the Firth of Forth became exhausted, forcing the extraction to take place further inland. Many of the sites were within the present day limits of Dunfermline.\n\n{{main|The mineral railways of Dunfermline}}\nThe increasing distance of the pits from the Forth made transport of the minerals an issue, and Dunfermline was a pioneer in the construction of wooden waggonways for the purpose. By the eighteenth century a complex network had developed, and in time many of the lines were converted to railways: the Halbeath Railway, the Fordell Railway, the Elgin Railway and the Townhill Tramway being the most prominent. They generally ran from north to south, still conveying the mineral to the harbours at Charlestown, Limekilns, Inverkeithing and St David's. From 1848 more modern railways entered Dunfermline, at first on a west to east axis, intersecting the mineral lines. In time the latter were converted to make through running on to the main line network possible.\n\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]] and [[victorian period]] industry in Dunfermline was concentrated to the north of the town centre around Pilmuir Street and to the south along sections of the Lynn Burn at Elgin and Bothwell Streets with textiles being particularly important to the town's economy. After the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] traditional industries, particularly linen and coal mining, declined and eventually became obsolete in the town with many factories ceasing production. Manufacturing in the town rejuvenated by the early 1960s when [[Monotype Corporation]] opened a new factory on Halbeath Road.<ref name=\"McEwan p73\">McEwan, Bert ''Dunfermline The Post-War Years'' p.&nbsp;73.</ref> The completion of the Pitreavie Industrial Estate (now known as the Pitreavie Business Park) opened in the mid-1970s, following the arrival of [[Philips]] and the re-location of the offices of the [[Dunfermline Press]].

''Toun'' is a word in [[Scots language|Scots]] which can refer to any form of settlement from farm estate to burgh or city (see headword ''toun'' in [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ Scots National Dictionary]) and the reference occurs most famously in the ballad [[Sir Patrick Spens]]: ''The king sits in Dunfermline Toun,/ Drinking the blude-reid wine...''</ref>\n|population= 50,380\n|population_ref= <ref name=\"GROS 2012 Table 3a\"/>\n|population_density= {{convert|1498|/sqmi|/km2|abbr=on}}\n|statistic1= Est. 71,820\n|statistic_title1 =\n|os_grid_reference= NT105875\n|edinburgh_distance_mi=13\n|london_distance_mi=343\n|language = English, Scots\n|coordinates = {{coord|56.07192|-3.43930|display=inline,title}}\n|unitary_scotland= [[Fife]]\n|lieutenancy_scotland= [[Fife]]\n|post_town= DUNFERMLINE\n|postcode_district = KY11, KY12\n|postcode_area= KY\n|dial_code= 01383\n|constituency_westminster= [[Dunfermline and West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline and West Fife]]\n|constituency_scottish_parliament= [[Dunfermline (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline]]\n|static_image_name= Scotland-2016-Aerial-Dunfermline Abbey.jpg\n|static_image_caption= Aerial view of Dunfermline Abbey and historic quarter\n|area_total_sq_mi= 7.07\n}}\n\n'''Dunfermline''' ({{IPAc-en|d|\u028c|n|\u02c8|f|\u025c\u02d0r|m|l|\u1d7b|n|audio=Dunfermline.ogg}}; {{lang-sco|Dunfaurlin}}, {{lang-gd|D\u00f9n Ph\u00e0rlain}}) is a town and former [[Royal Burgh]], and parish, in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], on high ground {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}} from the northern shore of the [[Firth of Forth]]. The town recorded a population of 50,380 in 2012, making it the most populous locality in Fife and the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|11th most populous in Scotland]].\n\nThe earliest known settlements in the area around Dunfermline probably date as far back as the [[Neolithic]] period. The area was not regionally significant until at least the [[Bronze Age]]. The town was first recorded in the 11th century, with the marriage of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], King of Scots, and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret]] at the church in Dunfermline. As his [[List of Scottish consorts|Queen consort]], Margaret established a new church dedicated to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], which evolved into an [[Dunfermline Abbey|Abbey]] under their son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1128. During the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]], the church - later to be known as Dunfermline Abbey - was firmly established as a prosperous royal mausoleum for the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish Crown]]. A total of eighteen royals, including seven Kings, were buried here from Queen Margaret in 1093 to [[Robert, Duke of Albany|Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in 1420. [[Robert The Bruce]], otherwise known as Robert I, became the last of the seven Scottish Kings to be buried in 1329. His bones would eventually be re-discovered and re-buried in 1821, when the excavation of the grounds of what had formerly been the eastern section of the Abbey became the site for the new Abbey Church.\n\nThe town is a major service centre for west Fife. Dunfermline retains much of its historic significance, as well as providing facilities for leisure. Employment is focused in the service sector, with the largest employer being [[Sky UK]]. Other large employers in the area include [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (on-line retailer), [[Best Western]] (hotels), CR Smith (windows manufacturing), [[FMC Technologies]] (offshore energy), [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] (both financial services).<ref name=\"Dunfermline Economy Presentation p.4\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Dunfermline}}\n[[File:Malcolm Canmore's Tower, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of Malcolm Canmore's Tower]]\nThere have been various interpretations of the name, ''\"Dunfermline\"''.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\">Dennison and Stronach, ''Historic Dunfermline'', pp.3\u20134.</ref> The first element, ''\"dun\"'' translated from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], has been accepted as a (fortified) hill, and is assumed to be referring to the rocky outcrop at the site of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]]'s tower in Pittencrieff Glen (now [[Pittencrieff Park]]).<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\">Taylor and M\u00e1rkus, ''The Place\u2013Names of Fife: Volume One'', pp.309\u2013310.</ref> The rest of the name is problematic.<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" /> The second element, ''\"the ferm\"'' may have been an alternative name for the Tower Burn according to a medieval record published in 1455 which, together with the Lyne Burn to the south, suggests the site of a fortification between these two watercourses.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\" /><ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" />\n\nThe first record of a settlement in the Dunfermline area was in the [[Neolithic]] period.

Council housing was focused towards [[Abbeyview]], on a {{convert|240|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} site on Aberdour Road; Touch, to the south of Garvock Hill; Bellyeoman and Baldridgeburn.

This growth has edged the population centre towards the town's boundary with the M90 road corridor; it is planned to continue until 2022. Major developments include the creation of the [[Duloch]] and Masterton neighbourhoods with over 6,000 homes, three new primary schools, new community infrastructure, employment land and the Fife Leisure Park.

As the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] gathered pace the demand for [[Agricultural lime|lime]] (for improving land) increased the requirement for coal to burn it. Salt panning too required coal in large quantities, and the early outcrops near the Firth of Forth became exhausted, forcing the extraction to take place further inland. Many of the sites were within the present day limits of Dunfermline.\n\n{{main|The mineral railways of Dunfermline}}\nThe increasing distance of the pits from the Forth made transport of the minerals an issue, and Dunfermline was a pioneer in the construction of wooden waggonways for the purpose. By the eighteenth century a complex network had developed, and in time many of the lines were converted to railways: the Halbeath Railway, the Fordell Railway, the Elgin Railway and the Townhill Tramway being the most prominent. They generally ran from north to south, still conveying the mineral to the harbours at Charlestown, Limekilns, Inverkeithing and St David's. From 1848 more modern railways entered Dunfermline, at first on a west to east axis, intersecting the mineral lines. In time the latter were converted to make through running on to the main line network possible.\n\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]] and [[victorian period]] industry in Dunfermline was concentrated to the north of the town centre around Pilmuir Street and to the south along sections of the Lynn Burn at Elgin and Bothwell Streets with textiles being particularly important to the town's economy. After the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] traditional industries, particularly linen and coal mining, declined and eventually became obsolete in the town with many factories ceasing production. Manufacturing in the town rejuvenated by the early 1960s when [[Monotype Corporation]] opened a new factory on Halbeath Road.<ref name=\"McEwan p73\">McEwan, Bert ''Dunfermline The Post-War Years'' p.&nbsp;73.</ref> The completion of the Pitreavie Industrial Estate (now known as the Pitreavie Business Park) opened in the mid-1970s, following the arrival of [[Philips]] and the re-location of the offices of the [[Dunfermline Press]].
