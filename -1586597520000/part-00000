It is located {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

Retrieved on 18 August 2017.</ref> Unlike Sunni theology where God's Essence is conjoined to eternal attributes, the early Shi'i Imams emphasized a theology according to which God's Essence is beyond all names and attributes. The first creation of God is a spiritual entity (Ruhani) or light (nur) called the Intellect ('Aql), the Light of Muhammad (nur Muhammad) or the Light of Ali. This cosmic Intellect or Light exists prior to the creation of the physical world and is the highest of created beings is identified with the Eternal Imam or the spiritual essence of the Prophet Muhammad and the Shi'i Imams. The historical Imams on earth are the locus of manifestation (mazhar) of the Light (nur) or Intellect (aql). Ismaili philosophers developed these ideas further using Neoplatonic frameworks and identified the Intellect ('Aql) or Light of the Imam with the Universal Intellect (Nous) of Plotinus. Similarly, the Imam's human soul \u2013 revered as pure based on Qur'an 33:33 \u2013 is regarded as the reflective mirror of the Universal Intellect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ismailignosis.com/2014/07/11/light-upon-light-glimpses-into-the-succession-of-the-shia-ismaili-imams/|title=Light upon Light: Glimpses into the Succession of the Shia Ismaili Imams|work=Ismaili Gnosis|access-date=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426011105/http://ismailignosis.com/2014/07/11/light-upon-light-glimpses-into-the-succession-of-the-shia-ismaili-imams/|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live|date=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1975 ''Ismailia Association Conference'' \u2013 a meeting of the Aga Khan with senior Nizari Ismaili council leaders from several countries \u2013 addressed the question of the status of the Imam. It mentioned:\n\n\"The Imam to be explained as the 'mazhar' [\"locus of manifestation\"] of God, and the relationship between God and the Imam to be related to varying levels of inspiration and communication from God to man.\"<ref>Paris Conference Report Minutes</ref> [http://ismaili.net/source/legal-documents/1975-paris-conference-minutes-rupani.pdf Paris Conference Report]\n\nThe term mazhar is also used in Sufi literature by Ibn 'Arabi (\"Bezels of Wisdom\"), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (\"Contemplation and Action\", \"The Paradise of Submission\") and many others. The meaning of the word mazhar denotes the idea of a mirror in which an object is reflected as an image but not incarnate.

The first creation of God is a spiritual entity (Ruhani) or light (nur) called the Intellect ('Aql), the Light of Muhammad (nur Muhammad) or the Light of Ali. This cosmic Intellect or Light exists prior to the creation of the physical world and is the highest of created beings is identified with the Eternal Imam or the spiritual essence of the Prophet Muhammad and the Shi'i Imams. The historical Imams on earth are the locus of manifestation (mazhar) of the Light (nur) or Intellect (aql). Ismaili philosophers developed these ideas further using Neoplatonic frameworks and identified the Intellect ('Aql) or Light of the Imam with the Universal Intellect (Nous) of Plotinus. Similarly, the Imam's human soul \u2013 revered as pure based on Qur'an 33:33 \u2013 is regarded as the reflective mirror of the Universal Intellect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ismailignosis.com/2014/07/11/light-upon-light-glimpses-into-the-succession-of-the-shia-ismaili-imams/|title=Light upon Light: Glimpses into the Succession of the Shia Ismaili Imams|work=Ismaili Gnosis|access-date=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426011105/http://ismailignosis.com/2014/07/11/light-upon-light-glimpses-into-the-succession-of-the-shia-ismaili-imams/|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live|date=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1975 ''Ismailia Association Conference'' \u2013 a meeting of the Aga Khan with senior Nizari Ismaili council leaders from several countries \u2013 addressed the question of the status of the Imam. It mentioned:\n\n\"The Imam to be explained as the 'mazhar' [\"locus of manifestation\"] of God, and the relationship between God and the Imam to be related to varying levels of inspiration and communication from God to man.\"<ref>Paris Conference Report Minutes</ref> [http://ismaili.net/source/legal-documents/1975-paris-conference-minutes-rupani.pdf Paris Conference Report]\n\nThe term mazhar is also used in Sufi literature by Ibn 'Arabi (\"Bezels of Wisdom\"), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (\"Contemplation and Action\", \"The Paradise of Submission\") and many others. The meaning of the word mazhar denotes the idea of a mirror in which an object is reflected as an image but not incarnate. Similarly, the Imam as mazhar (locus of manifestation, mirror) 'differs greatly' from the idea of incarnation or indwelling (hulul) in which the Divine dwells inside a material body. The Imam is ''not'' seen as an incarnation of divinity. The [[Imam]] is also the [[Pir (Sufism)]] within [[Nizari]] [[Ismailism]] denoting a title from the [[Sufi]] heritage of Nizari Ismaili history.\n\n===Silver Jubilee Year of Imamat===\nFrom 11 July 1982 to 11 July 1983 \u2013 to celebrate the present Aga Khan's Silver Jubilee, marking the 25th anniversary of his accession to the Imamat \u2013 many new social and economic development projects were launched.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/14/world/aga-khan-s-silver-jubilee-bridging-two-worlds.html|title=Aga Khan's Silver Jubilee: Bridging Two Worlds|last=Cowell|first=Alan|date=14 October 1982|work=The New York Times|access-date=7 May 2019|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> These range from the establishment of the US$450 million international [[Aga Khan University]] with its Faculty of Health Sciences and teaching hospital based in [[Karachi]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nadeem|first=Naila|last2=Khawaja|first2=Ranish Deedar Ali|last3=Beg|first3=Madiha|last4=Naeem|first4=Muhammad|last5=Majid|first5=Zain|date=21 March 2013|title=Undergraduate radiology education in private and public teaching hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan: teaching duties, methodologies, and rewards|journal=Advances in Medical Education and Practice|volume=4|pages=31\u201337|doi=10.2147/AMEP.S40549|issn=1179-7258|pmc=3661265|pmid=23745098}}</ref> the expansion of schools for girls and medical centres in the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] region<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/high-up-on-a-pakistani-mountain-a-success-story-for-moderate-islam/2015/07/22/f0b878d2-2572-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593_story.html|title=High up on a Pakistani mountain, a success story for moderate Islam|last=Craig|first=Time|website=Washington Post}}</ref> (one of the remote parts of Northern Pakistan bordering on China and Afghanistan that is densely populated with Nizari Ismailis), to the establishment of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://landportal.org/organization/aga-khan-rural-support-programme|title=Aga Khan Rural Support Programme {{!}} Land Portal {{!}} Securing Land Rights Through Open Data|website=landportal.org|access-date=7 May 2019}}</ref> in Gujarat, India \u2013 and the extension of existing urban hospitals and primary health care centres in Tanzania and Kenya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/635711464369507187/WB-SDI-Brief-Tanzania-HEALTH-v6-print.pdf|title=Tanzania Service Delivery Indicators|website=World Bank}}</ref> Noor Karimi was married during the Silver Jubilee Year of Imamat and he even placed the ring on her finger.\n\n===Golden Jubilee Year of Imamat===\n11 July 2007 to 13 December 2008 marked the 50th Anniversary of the Aga Khan's reign of Imamat (Golden Jubilee).

They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.

Alten ''Audio Basics'' Cengage 2011 {{ISBN|0-495-91356-1}} page&nbsp;63</ref> Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.  Another type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''<ref name=\":5\" /> consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are [[bone conduction]] headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]].\n\nHeadphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHeadphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.  Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using [[Bluetooth]] connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |title=It's True: Apple Will Drop Headphone Jack To Make The iPhone 7 Slimmer, Says Source |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829052849/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |archivedate=2016-08-29 |work = Fast Company|first = Mark|last = Sullivan|date = 7 January 2016}}</ref>   Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.  Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.\n\n=={{anchor|history}}History==\n[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]\nHeadphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181 |last=Howeth|first = Linwood S.|title = History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy |chapter = Chapter XI: The Early Radio Industry and the United States Navy|page = 149|date=1963|accessdate=|df=}}</ref><ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go.

The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.\n\nIn early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.\n\nIn 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"hearthis\">{{cite news|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.<ref name=\"hearthis\"/>\n\nSmaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05}}</ref><ref>Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: <br>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960'S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.\n\n== Applications ==\nHeadphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].\n[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]\nIn the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.\n\nWired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc\u2033) and 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&nbsp;mm and 3.5&nbsp;mm devices.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.\n\n=== Impedance ===\nHeadphones are available with high or low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.\n\nThe impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The \"0-Ohm\" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}</ref> Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.\n\nHistorically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.\n\n=== Sensitivity ===\nSensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Understanding Headphone Power Requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |work = HeadWize|publisher = Northwestern University|first = Dennis|last = Bohn}}</ref>  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{mW} - 10 \\cdot \\log_{10}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}</math>\n\nAlternatively, online calculators can be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity & Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014}}</ref>  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&nbsp;dB.\n\nPairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40\u20134000&nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.<ref>{{cite web |title= BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=|work = ISVR Consulting|url =http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm|date = 2 August 2018}}</ref>  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.\n\nThe sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nHeadphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.\n\n=== Circumaural ===\n[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]\n'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.\n\n=== Supra-aural ===\n[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]\n'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.\n\n=== Open or closed back ===\nBoth circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:\n\n'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.\n\n'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.\n\n'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term \"semi-open\" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.\n\n=== Ear-fitting headphones ===\n\n==== Earphones ====\n{{multiple image\n |direction=vertical\n | image1=Earphones BW 2011-12-10 15-49-08.JPG | alt1=2\n | width1 = 170\n | image2=EarPods derecho.JPG | alt3=4\n | width2 = 170\n | footer = Earbuds/earphones sit in the outer ear\n}}\nEarphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the [[outer ear]], facing but not inserted in the ear canal.

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Who Made That Earbud? |work = The New York Times Magazine|date = 16 May 2014|first = Daniel|last = Engber|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>)\n\n==== In-ear headphones ====\n{{Main|In-ear monitor}}\n[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]\nIn-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.\n\nThe outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|accessdate=14 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nGeneric or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam.

Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.\n\n==== Telephone headsets ====\n[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]\nTelephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.\n\nFor older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.\n\n==== Communication headsets ====\n[[File:Communication Headset.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Communication headset used by aviators]]\nCommunication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone. Such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation, military, sports, music, and many service-oriented sectors. They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on use, required noise attenuation, and fidelity of communication needed.\n\n== Ambient noise reduction ==\nUnwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].\n\n[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]\nPassive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&nbsp;dB.\n\nActive noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.\n\n== Transducer technology ==\nHeadphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.\n\n=== Moving-coil ===\n[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]\nThe [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.\n\n=== Electrostatic ===\n[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]\nElectrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&nbsp;volts.\n\nDue to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nElectrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&nbsp;V to over 1&nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.\n\n=== Electret ===\nAn [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a \"Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film\", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.\n\n===Planar Magnetic===\n\nPlanar Magnetic (also known as Orthodynamic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].\n\nA planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.\nA current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.\n\n=== Balanced armature ===\n[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]\n\nA balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].\n\n[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]\nThe design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.\n\nToday they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.<ref>\nTyll Hertsens.\n[http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work \"How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914044126/http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work |date=2015-09-14 }}.\n2014.\n</ref>\nThey generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&nbsp;Hz and above 16&nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.\n\nThe earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G.

Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Other transducer technologies ===\nTransducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.\n\n[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.\n\n== Benefits and limitations ==\n[[File:Sony MDR-7506 Stowed 7617.jpg|thumb|Sony MDR-7506 headphones in stowed configuration]]\nHeadphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz within 3&nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15\" or 18\") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.\n\nMarketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&nbsp;Hz is typically very small.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html|website =CNET|title = How to buy headphones|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |quote =Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance\u201415 or 20Hz\u2014but almost always sound lightweight and bright.}}</ref> \nHeadphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire).\n\nAlthough modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.\n\n[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.\n\nIt is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.\n\nHeadsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]].

Another type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''<ref name=\":5\" /> consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are [[bone conduction]] headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]].\n\nHeadphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHeadphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.  Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source.

Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.\n\n=={{anchor|history}}History==\n[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]\nHeadphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181 |last=Howeth|first = Linwood S.|title = History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy |chapter = Chapter XI: The Early Radio Industry and the United States Navy|page = 149|date=1963|accessdate=|df=}}</ref><ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go.

The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.\n\nIn early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.\n\nIn 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"hearthis\">{{cite news|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.<ref name=\"hearthis\"/>\n\nSmaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05}}</ref><ref>Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: <br>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960'S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.\n\n== Applications ==\nHeadphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].\n[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]\nIn the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.\n\nWired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc\u2033) and 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&nbsp;mm and 3.5&nbsp;mm devices.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.\n\n=== Impedance ===\nHeadphones are available with high or low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.\n\nThe impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The \"0-Ohm\" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}</ref> Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.\n\nHistorically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.\n\n=== Sensitivity ===\nSensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Understanding Headphone Power Requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |work = HeadWize|publisher = Northwestern University|first = Dennis|last = Bohn}}</ref>  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{mW} - 10 \\cdot \\log_{10}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}</math>\n\nAlternatively, online calculators can be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity & Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014}}</ref>  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&nbsp;dB.\n\nPairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40\u20134000&nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.<ref>{{cite web |title= BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=|work = ISVR Consulting|url =http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm|date = 2 August 2018}}</ref>  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.\n\nThe sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nHeadphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.\n\n=== Circumaural ===\n[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]\n'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.\n\n=== Supra-aural ===\n[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]\n'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.\n\n=== Open or closed back ===\nBoth circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:\n\n'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.\n\n'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.\n\n'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term \"semi-open\" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.\n\n=== Ear-fitting headphones ===\n\n==== Earphones ====\n{{multiple image\n |direction=vertical\n | image1=Earphones BW 2011-12-10 15-49-08.JPG | alt1=2\n | width1 = 170\n | image2=EarPods derecho.JPG | alt3=4\n | width2 = 170\n | footer = Earbuds/earphones sit in the outer ear\n}}\nEarphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the [[outer ear]], facing but not inserted in the ear canal.

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Who Made That Earbud? |work = The New York Times Magazine|date = 16 May 2014|first = Daniel|last = Engber|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>)\n\n==== In-ear headphones ====\n{{Main|In-ear monitor}}\n[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]\nIn-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.\n\nThe outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|accessdate=14 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nGeneric or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam.

Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.\n\n==== Telephone headsets ====\n[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]\nTelephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.\n\nFor older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.\n\n==== Communication headsets ====\n[[File:Communication Headset.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Communication headset used by aviators]]\nCommunication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone. Such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation, military, sports, music, and many service-oriented sectors. They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on use, required noise attenuation, and fidelity of communication needed.\n\n== Ambient noise reduction ==\nUnwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].\n\n[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]\nPassive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&nbsp;dB.\n\nActive noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.\n\n== Transducer technology ==\nHeadphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.\n\n=== Moving-coil ===\n[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]\nThe [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.\n\n=== Electrostatic ===\n[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]\nElectrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&nbsp;volts.\n\nDue to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nElectrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&nbsp;V to over 1&nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.\n\n=== Electret ===\nAn [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a \"Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film\", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.\n\n===Planar Magnetic===\n\nPlanar Magnetic (also known as Orthodynamic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].\n\nA planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.\nA current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.\n\n=== Balanced armature ===\n[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]\n\nA balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].\n\n[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]\nThe design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.\n\nToday they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.<ref>\nTyll Hertsens.\n[http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work \"How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914044126/http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work |date=2015-09-14 }}.\n2014.\n</ref>\nThey generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&nbsp;Hz and above 16&nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.\n\nThe earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G.

Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Other transducer technologies ===\nTransducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.\n\n[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.\n\n== Benefits and limitations ==\n[[File:Sony MDR-7506 Stowed 7617.jpg|thumb|Sony MDR-7506 headphones in stowed configuration]]\nHeadphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz within 3&nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15\" or 18\") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.\n\nMarketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&nbsp;Hz is typically very small.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html|website =CNET|title = How to buy headphones|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |quote =Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance\u201415 or 20Hz\u2014but almost always sound lightweight and bright.}}</ref> \nHeadphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire).\n\nAlthough modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.\n\n[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.\n\nIt is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.\n\nHeadsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families.

It forms a Speaking Telegraph, without the necessity for any hollow tube.\n \nI claim that a portion or the whole of the effect may also be realized by a corresponding arrangement with a metallic tube.  I believe that some metals will serve better than others, but propose to try all kinds of metals.\n \nThe system on which I propose to operate and calculate consists in isolating two persons, separated at considerable distance from each other, by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire.\n \nI believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph, but will experiment on this. Each of these persons holds to his mouth an instrument analogous to a speaking trumpet, in which the word may easily be pronounced, and the sound concentrated upon the wire.  Another instrument is also applied to the ears, in order to receive the voice of the opposite party.\n \nAll these, to wit, the mouth utensil and the ear instruments, communicate to the wire at a short distance from the persons.  The ear utensils being of a convex form, like a clock glass, enclose the whole exterior part of the ear, and make it easy and comfortable for the operator. The object is to bring distinctly to the hearing the word of the person at the opposite end of the telegraph.  \n \nTo call attention, the party at the other end of the line may be warned by an electric telegraph signal, or a series of them.  The apparatus for this purpose, and the skill in operating it, need be much less than for the ordinary telegraphing.\n \nWhen my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should remain alone in their respective rooms, and every practicable precaution should be taken to have the surroundings perfectly quiet. The closed mouth utensil or trumpet, and the enclosing the persons also in a room alone, both tend to prevent undue publicity to the communication.\n \nI think it will be easy, by these means, to prevent the communication being understood by any but the proper persons.\n \nIt may be found practicable to work with the person sending the message insulated, and with the person receiving it, in the free electrical communication with the ground.  Or these conditions may possibly be reversed and still operate with some success.\n \nBoth the conductors or utensils for mouth and ears should be, in fact I must say must be, metallic, and be so conditioned as to be good conductors of electricity.\n \nI claim as my invention, and desire to have considered as such, for all the purposes of this Caveat,\n \nThe new invention herein set forth in all its details, combinations, and sub-combinations.\n \nAnd more especially, I claim\n \nFirst. A continuous sound conductor electrically insulated.\n \nSecond. The same adapted for telegraphing by sound or for conversation between distant parties electrically insulated. \n \nThird. The employment of a sound conductor, which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound between distant points.\n \nFourth. The same in combination with provisions for electrically insulating the sending and receiving parties.\n \nFifth. The mouthpiece or speaking utensil in combination with an electrically insulating conductor.\n \nSixth. The ear utensils or receiving vessels adapted to apply upon the ears in combination with an electrically insulating sound conductor.\n \nSeventh. The entire system, comprising the electrical and sound conductor, insulated and furnished with a mouthpiece and ear pieces at each end, adapted to serve as specified.\n \nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand in presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n \nANTONIO MEUCCI\n\nWitnesses:\n\nShirley McAndrew.\n\nFred'k Harper.\n \nEndorsed:\n\nPatent Office\n\nDec. 28, 1871\n| source = \n| width  = 95%\n| align  = full\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Analysis of Meucci's caveat===\nMeucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat, page 17 top</ref> The mouth piece is like a \"speaking trumpet\" so that \"the sound concentrated upon the wire\" is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\">Caveat page 17</ref> \"Another instrument is also applied to the ears,\" but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\"/> In the third claim, he claims \"a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound\"<ref>Caveat page 18</ref> which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that somehow get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.\"<ref>\"metallic tube\" in Caveat, page 16 bottom.</ref>\n\nMeucci emphasizes that the conductors \"for mouth and ears ... must be metallic\", but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat pages 17 bottom line \u2013 18 top line</ref> He mentions \"communication with the ground\"<ref>Caveat, page 17 bottom.</ref> but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only \"the wire\" (singular, not plural) is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators (\"...{{nbsp}}consists in isolating two persons ... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire\").<ref>Caveat page 17, 3rd paragraph.</ref>\n\nRobert V.

Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) of New York. ADT did not merge with Western Union to become its subsidiary until 1901.<ref name=autogenerated4>Catania, Basilio.

The [[:it:Associazione Elettrotecnica|Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica]] has devoted a museum to Meucci making a chronology of his inventing the telephone and tracing the history of the two trials opposing Meucci and Bell.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusione], aei.it. {{in lang|it}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206035330/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm |date=6 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm Museo Storico Virtuale dell'AEIT Sala Antonio Meucci], aei.it. {{in lang|it}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510071411/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm |date=10 May 2006 }}</ref> They support the claim that Antonio Meucci was the real inventor of the telephone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci_faq.htm#6|title=Antonio Meucci \u2013 Questions and Answers|website=www.chezbasilio.org}}</ref>\nHowever, some scholars outside Italy do not recognize the claims that Meucci's device had any bearing on the development of the telephone. Tomas Farley also writes that, \"Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys [Bell and Watson] were the first to transmit speech one could understand.\"<ref name=Bellis/>\n\nIn 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"[[Teatro della Pergola]]\" in [[Florence]]. This telephone was constructed on the model of [[Speaking tube|pipe-telephones]] on ships and is still functional.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an [[electroscope]]\u2014which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (talking telegraph).<ref name=\"mam_voce\"/>{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone\u2014such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], and others\u2014he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the \"make-and-break\" method). Instead, he looked for a \"continuous\" solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium [[dichromate]] and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMeucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so-called \"local effect\"\u2014using what we would call today a four-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short-circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses (clicks) that were louder than normal conversation.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron).{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device \"telettrofono\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others (the court's findings, reported in 31 Fed. Rep. 729).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nN. Herbert in his ''History of the Telephone'' said:\n\n{{quote|To bait the Bell Company became almost a national sport. Any sort of claimant, with any sort of wild tale of prior invention, could find a speculator to support him. On they came, a motley array, 'some in rags, some on nags, and some in velvet gowns.' One of them claimed to have done wonders with an iron hoop and a file in 1867; a second had a marvellous table with glass legs; a third swore that he had made a telephone in 1860, but did not know what it was until he saw Bell's patent; and a fourth told a vivid story of having heard a bullfrog croak via a telegraph wire which was strung into a certain cellar in Racine, in 1851.<ref>Casson, Herbert N.

In Havana he constructed a system for water purification and reconstructed the Gran Teatro.<ref name=\"museoaica.it\"/><ref name=\"smeucci\"/>\n \nIn 1848 his contract with the governor expired. Meucci was asked by a friend's doctors to work on [[Franz Anton Mesmer]]'s therapy system on patients suffering from [[rheumatism]].

On Staten Island he helped several countrymen committed to the Italian unification movement and who had escaped political persecution. Meucci invested the substantial capital he had earned in Cuba into a tallow candle factory (the first of this kind in America) employing several Italian exiles. For two years Meucci hosted friends at his cottage, including General [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], and Colonel Paolo Bovi Campeggi, who arrived in New York two months after Meucci. They worked in Meucci's factory.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1854, Meucci's wife Esterre became an invalid due to [[rheumatoid arthritis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Meucci continued his experiments.\n\n==Electromagnetic telephone==\nMeucci studied the principles of electromagnetic voice transmission for many years{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} and was able to transmit his voice through wires in 1856. He installed a telephone-like device within his house in order to communicate with his wife who was ill at the time.<ref name=\"smeucci\"/> Some of Meucci's notes written in 1857 describe the basic principle of electromagnetic voice transmission or in other words, the telephone:\n\n{{quote|''Consiste in un diaframma vibrante e in un magnete elettrizzato da un filo a spirale che lo avvolge.

His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable for anybody to invest.<ref name=\"museoaica.it\"/>\n\n==Bankruptcy==\nAt the same time, Meucci was led to poverty by some fraudulent debtors. On 13 November 1861 his cottage was auctioned. The purchaser allowed the Meuccis to live in the cottage without paying rent, but Meucci's private finances dwindled and he soon had to live on public funds and by depending on his friends.

Their close working friendship continued until 1867.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1870, Meucci reportedly was able to capture a transmission of articulated human voice at the distance of a mile by using a copper plate as a conductor, insulated by cotton. He called this device the \"telettrofono\". While he was recovering from injuries that befell him in a boiler explosion aboard a [[Staten Island Ferry|Staten Island ferry]], the ''Westfield'', Meucci's financial and health state was so bad that his wife sold his drawings and devices to a second-hand dealer to raise money.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Patent caveat==\n<!--this section heading is linked to [[Invention of the telephone]]-->\nOn 12 December 1871 Meucci set up an agreement with Angelo Zilio Grandi (Secretary of the Italian [[Consulate]] in New York), Angelo Antonio Tremeschin ([[entrepreneur]]), Sereno G.P.

It forms a Speaking Telegraph, without the necessity for any hollow tube.\n \nI claim that a portion or the whole of the effect may also be realized by a corresponding arrangement with a metallic tube.  I believe that some metals will serve better than others, but propose to try all kinds of metals.\n \nThe system on which I propose to operate and calculate consists in isolating two persons, separated at considerable distance from each other, by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire.\n \nI believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph, but will experiment on this. Each of these persons holds to his mouth an instrument analogous to a speaking trumpet, in which the word may easily be pronounced, and the sound concentrated upon the wire.  Another instrument is also applied to the ears, in order to receive the voice of the opposite party.\n \nAll these, to wit, the mouth utensil and the ear instruments, communicate to the wire at a short distance from the persons.  The ear utensils being of a convex form, like a clock glass, enclose the whole exterior part of the ear, and make it easy and comfortable for the operator. The object is to bring distinctly to the hearing the word of the person at the opposite end of the telegraph.  \n \nTo call attention, the party at the other end of the line may be warned by an electric telegraph signal, or a series of them.  The apparatus for this purpose, and the skill in operating it, need be much less than for the ordinary telegraphing.\n \nWhen my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should remain alone in their respective rooms, and every practicable precaution should be taken to have the surroundings perfectly quiet. The closed mouth utensil or trumpet, and the enclosing the persons also in a room alone, both tend to prevent undue publicity to the communication.\n \nI think it will be easy, by these means, to prevent the communication being understood by any but the proper persons.\n \nIt may be found practicable to work with the person sending the message insulated, and with the person receiving it, in the free electrical communication with the ground.  Or these conditions may possibly be reversed and still operate with some success.\n \nBoth the conductors or utensils for mouth and ears should be, in fact I must say must be, metallic, and be so conditioned as to be good conductors of electricity.\n \nI claim as my invention, and desire to have considered as such, for all the purposes of this Caveat,\n \nThe new invention herein set forth in all its details, combinations, and sub-combinations.\n \nAnd more especially, I claim\n \nFirst. A continuous sound conductor electrically insulated.\n \nSecond. The same adapted for telegraphing by sound or for conversation between distant parties electrically insulated. \n \nThird. The employment of a sound conductor, which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound between distant points.\n \nFourth. The same in combination with provisions for electrically insulating the sending and receiving parties.\n \nFifth. The mouthpiece or speaking utensil in combination with an electrically insulating conductor.\n \nSixth. The ear utensils or receiving vessels adapted to apply upon the ears in combination with an electrically insulating sound conductor.\n \nSeventh. The entire system, comprising the electrical and sound conductor, insulated and furnished with a mouthpiece and ear pieces at each end, adapted to serve as specified.\n \nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand in presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n \nANTONIO MEUCCI\n\nWitnesses:\n\nShirley McAndrew.\n\nFred'k Harper.\n \nEndorsed:\n\nPatent Office\n\nDec. 28, 1871\n| source = \n| width  = 95%\n| align  = full\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Analysis of Meucci's caveat===\nMeucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat, page 17 top</ref> The mouth piece is like a \"speaking trumpet\" so that \"the sound concentrated upon the wire\" is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\">Caveat page 17</ref> \"Another instrument is also applied to the ears,\" but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound.<ref name=\"Caveat page 17\"/> In the third claim, he claims \"a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound\"<ref>Caveat page 18</ref> which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that somehow get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.\"<ref>\"metallic tube\" in Caveat, page 16 bottom.</ref>\n\nMeucci emphasizes that the conductors \"for mouth and ears ... must be metallic\", but does not explain why this would be desirable.<ref>Caveat pages 17 bottom line \u2013 18 top line</ref> He mentions \"communication with the ground\"<ref>Caveat, page 17 bottom.</ref> but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only \"the wire\" (singular, not plural) is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators (\"...{{nbsp}}consists in isolating two persons ... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire\").<ref>Caveat page 17, 3rd paragraph.</ref>\n\nRobert V.

Grant, Vice President of American District Telegraph Co. of New York (not [[Western Union]] as sometimes stated), to ask for help. Meucci asked him for permission to test his apparatus on the company's telegraph lines. He gave Grant a description of his prototype and a copy of his caveat.

In the trial, Antonio Meucci was accused of having produced records after Bell's invention and [[back-date]]d them. As proof, the prosecutor brought forward the fact that the Rider & Clark company was founded only in 1863. At trial, Meucci said William E.

During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) of New York.

Tomas Farley also writes that, \"Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys [Bell and Watson] were the first to transmit speech one could understand.\"<ref name=Bellis/>\n\nIn 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"[[Teatro della Pergola]]\" in [[Florence]]. This telephone was constructed on the model of [[Speaking tube|pipe-telephones]] on ships and is still functional.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an [[electroscope]]\u2014which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (talking telegraph).<ref name=\"mam_voce\"/>{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone\u2014such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], and others\u2014he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the \"make-and-break\" method). Instead, he looked for a \"continuous\" solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium [[dichromate]] and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMeucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so-called \"local effect\"\u2014using what we would call today a four-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short-circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses (clicks) that were louder than normal conversation.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron).{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device \"telettrofono\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others (the court's findings, reported in 31 Fed. Rep. 729).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nN. Herbert in his ''History of the Telephone'' said:\n\n{{quote|To bait the Bell Company became almost a national sport.
